We are very pleased with our performance in Q4, which once again showed high growth at scale and demonstrated efficiencies. Despite the unique challenges presented by COVID, we continued in 2020 to introduce new products at a high velocity, grow top line at a rapid rate and demonstrate strong operating efficiencies. We are in particular, very proud of the way our teams have handled the pandemic as well as other unprecedented challenges. We ended the year with 2,185 employees globally, a 56% increase year-over-year with high growth of both our go-to-market and R&D teams. One of our strategic decisions at the beginning of the pandemic was to keep on hiring and we have been able to interview, hire and onboard remotely while maintaining high employee engagement and productivity. Throughout the year, we have worked to keep our employees safe and productive and to be good citizens of our communities as they face significant challenges. We are very proud of the exceptional grants we have awarded to our employees in Q2 and Q4 both to support them individually and to allow them to donate nearly $1 million to charities focused on COVID reliefs as well as social and racial justice efforts. Last, but certainly not least, we have maintained our relentless focus on delivering value to our customers. And while the pandemic has been a source of challenges to businesses this year, we believe it will prove to be an accelerator of cloud migration and digital transformation over time. In other words we learned a lot this year, including our ability to execute in the face of challenging as well as confirmation of a very large and growing market opportunity. Now, on to a review of the quarter. To summarize Q4 at a high level, revenue was $178 million, an increase of 56% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We also ended the year with 97 customers with an ARR of $1 million or more, almost double the 50 last year and more than three times of 29 we had just two years ago. We ended the year with 1,253 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more up from 858 last year. These customers generated about 75% of our ARR. We have about 14,200 customers, up from about 10,500 last year, which means we added about 1,100 customers in the quarter, making it another strong quarter of ads after the 1,000 we added in Q3. We also continued to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $70 million. As in past quarters, our dollar based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. For the full-year, we generated revenue of $603 million, a 66% increase year-over-year, which was above the high end of our guidance and free cash flow was $83 million or a margin of 14% for the year. Now to review Q4 in more detail. Execution was very strong with outstanding sales performance, particularly against the macro backdrop. New logo generation was very strong, including a new record of new logo AR added that was significantly above last year\u2019s number. Very strong performance across the board from commercial and enterprise sales channels as well as a record number of $1 million plus new logo customers. Growth of existing customers was robust, as customers of all sizes continued to grow the usage of Datadog through both increased consumption and cross-selling and Q4\u2019s growth of existing customers was broadly in line with pre-COVID trends. Lastly, churn remains very low and consistent with pre-pandemic historical rates. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q4, 72% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 58% last year. Additionally 22% of customers are using four or more products, which is up from only 10% a year ago, and we have another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products. We are very happy with our platform traction including uptake of the newest products, NPM RUM and security, each of which has reached hundreds or thousands of customers in a short amount of time. As a reminder, our newer products are often adopted first by first selecting customers at small scale before our land and expand model enables greater adoption over time. And frictionless adoption from a single integrated platform is a key value proposition for our customers. Overall, our ability to both land and expand in a very challenging time speaks to our strong execution, to our leading product, and to our status as a strategic partner to our customers as they prioritize their digital operations. Now on to product and R&D. Today, we announced two acquisitions. First, we announced an agreement to acquire Sqreen, a SaaS-based security platform that enables enterprises to detect, block and respond to application-level attacks. Sqreen\u2019s technology provides runtime application self-protection or RASP, and in-app web application firewall also known as WAF and is already used by hundreds of companies today. Security issue in the application layer are complex to solve because application security causes lines of responsibility between dev, ops and security teams. As a result, we believe this will be a powerful combination for our customers using APM or Synthetics. Next we also announced the acquisition of Timber Technologies, the developers of Vector, a vendor-agnostic and high-performance observability data pipeline. With Vector, customers can collect, enrich, and transform logs, and other signals across multiple tools and data sources in both on-premises and cloud environments, and then route this data to the destination of their choice. We expect this technology to further empower our customers to control their observability data, while providing broader points of entry to a platform. I speak for everyone at Datadog in saying that we are extremely excited for the teams of both companies to join us in our quest to break down silos. Beyond the acquisition, we had a number of new developments in Q4. We launched the general availability of Incident Management, which allows users to declare incidents, investigate root cause and collaborate without leaving Datadog. And we also delivered more than 60 other new capabilities and features across our products, including new and enhanced integrations such as Snowflake, Oracle Cloud or vulnerability analysis monitoring Snyk with our brand new Continuous Profiler. Now taking a step back, we exit 2020 with nine generally available products. To put these in context, just four years ago we had only one product, and we have been able to build the most complete integrated and cloud-native observability platform because of our funding as an integration platform that is extensible to new use cases. Looking forward to 2021, we continue to feel that we\u2019re just getting started. First, we are doubling down on building out our platform for observability. This core market alone is a very large opportunity and is growing quickly with a replatforming to cloud architectures. We are still early in this transition and are aggressively adding functionality to both the new SKUs as well as the more mature products. Second, we are just getting started in security with our first product launch in 2020. We consider security a very large opportunity with a long runway of planned product development and we envision the silos between dev, tech and ops working down in a similar way to what we have seen between dev and ops. Third, we are investing in the platform and ecosystem. In addition to building up the Datadog marketplace, we now have strategic partnerships with all of the major cloud vendors. For example, we announced the expansion of our partnerships with Azure and GCP last quarter, which should be in the market in 2021. We are also introducing new cloud instances in regions such as Go Cloud. Our goal is to gain distribution across vendors and regions and in customers where they are to lower friction to adoption and to lower time to value. And as we think longer term beyond 2021, we do believe there may be more use cases we can solve for our customers beyond current reach of our platform. Let\u2019s move on to the sales and marketing. As I mentioned earlier, I\u2019m very pleased with the continued productivity of our go-to-market teams, and Q4 was a very strong sales quarter. So let\u2019s discuss some of our wins in the quarter. First, let\u2019s talk a bit about the way COVID has accelerated digital transformation. As expected in the quarter, we saw a seven-figure AR increases from COVID beneficiaries such as consumer device company, a large e-commerce platform and a global video games company. Perhaps more surprisingly though, we also had a number of notable upsells in companies that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, including a seven-figure upsells with a travel technology company and six figure upsells with two separate airlines as well as a physical event company. These deals demonstrate that Datadog is a key strategic partner to companies that are scaling rapidly over online as well as the [founded] businesses even in the most negatively impacted industries are investing heavily in their digital operations. Now let\u2019s dive into some of our other key wins for the quarter. First, I will highlight two notable seven-figure lands both with Fortune 100 companies, a retailer and an insurance company. Both have been struggling with teams in separate silos and are consolidating dozens of tools into Datadog giving a single view to both dev and ops teams. Next, we had a seven-figure land on the streaming sports platform in Asia, which was enabled by our new Datadog partner program. This company adopted the full data platform and our Tracing without Limits approach was a key differentiator as they are previous APM solutions suffered blind spots due to sampling and to a lack of integration with infrastructure data. Next, we had yet another seven-figure land this time from a SaaS company based in India. This company moves to us from a build-it-yourself approach and free its engineers so there could be more products and deliver innovation. Lastly, we had a nearly $1 million upsell to a very large management consulting firm. This company is now using our network direct monitoring products to replace legacy point solution and getting visibility into physical network devices. I would also note that this was one of the first expansion deals to benefit from a brand new marketplace offerings, in this case a partner developed integration with Office 365. Now moving on to our outlook, it is clear to us that the market trends that have driven our success so far have only gotten stronger. Businesses must be digital first like never before. The massive platform driven by cloud migration is still in its early stages and engineers and developers are truly strategic employees whose productivity and ability to collaborate are key drivers of business performance. While there is possibility for more near-term volatility caused by the macro environment, we are increasingly confident in our ability to execute in our long-term opportunity. And we believe that we can continue to sustain strong growth both in the near term and over time. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. Thanks Olivier. As mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter top and bottom line results amid a difficult macro backdrop. Revenue was $177.5 million, up 56% year-over-year against the challenging year-ago comp. New logo generation was very strong, usage trends were solid, platform traction continued to be strong and churn was in line to better than historical norms. To provide some more context. First new logo results were very strong. Both new logo ARR and the number of new logos were records for Datadog, displaying strong growth versus a year ago. New business contributions came across regions and from both our commercial and enterprise sales channels. Remember that given our usage based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into revenue. Growth of existing customers was robust and our dollar based net retention remained above 130% for the 14th consecutive quarter. We are pleased with the usage growth of existing customers, which showed continued adoption of our platform and their cloud migration even in the face of the macro pressures. To go into a little more detail. Growth of existing customers was broadly in line with long-term trends and meaningfully better than the level experienced in Q2 of last year. As a reminder, even though we have now experienced two quarters of usage growth that was approximately in line with pre-pandemic levels, Q2 was meaningfully pressured and that pressure will impact our year-over-year metrics, including revenue growth and net retention until we lap that compare. Next in the fourth quarter, we saw continued strength of our platform strategy with over 70% of our customers using two or more products, and 22% of our customers now using four or more products, up from only 10% a year ago. Given that 75% plus of our lands now come from two or more products, we believe the overall share of customers using two-plus products is closing in on that number. Lastly, churn was in line to slightly better than historical levels. This demonstrates the importance of our solution to our customers even during challenging times. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the low to mid-90s. Now turning to billings, which were $219.4 million, up 68% year-over-year. After adjusting for the timing of $6 million of billings in last year\u2019s fourth quarter pro forma billings growth was 61% year-over-year, strong and approximately in line with revenue growth. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $434 million, up 78% year-over-year. Both billings and contract duration extended in the quarter driven by strong annual billings and commitments as well as a few larger multi-year commits. It is important to note that those multi-year commits were built annually and we do not incentivize our sales force for multi-year deals given our high net retention rate. Current RPO growth was strong in the mid-60s similar to billings growth. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate versus revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the signing of customer contracts while revenue incorporates customer usage. Now let\u2019s review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $137.6 million, representing a gross margin of 78%. This compares to a gross margin of 79% last quarter and 78% in the year-ago period. The slight decrease in gross margin sequentially is due to minor inefficiencies created from our investments in products and platform innovation. As a reminder, our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter within an acceptable range as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of our cloud data centers in newer geographies. R&D expense was $53.5 million or 30% of revenues, compared to 27% in the year-ago quarter. We have continued to invest significantly in R&D, including high growth of our engineering headcount in which we added approximately 370 net R&D heads over the course of 2020. We have been able to attract talent and execute on hiring and onboarding during COVID. Sales and marketing expense was $52.5 million or 30% of revenues, compared to 35% in the year-ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but the pace of revenue growth has outpaced that investment. This was another quarter of no in-person trade shows or marketing events. While we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead generating activities, it was not on a one-for-one ratio. G&A expense was $13.5 million or 8% of revenues, slightly lower than the 9% in the year-ago quarter and operating income was $18.1 million or 10% operating margin compared to an operating income of $7.9 million with a 7% margin in the year-ago period. The continued reduction in marketing events, travel and entertainment and facilities overhead due to COVID were the primary drivers in the year-over-year leverage. Headcount growth was approximately in line with revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $19.1 million or $0.06 per share based on a 334 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $23.8 million in the quarter. After taking into consider capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $16.7 million for a margin of 9%. For the full-year, free cash flow was $83.2 million or 14% margin. Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter and the full-year of 2021. As Olivier mentioned, we believe we can deliver high growth for the foreseeable future as we are addressing a very large Greenfield market and are executing well against that opportunity. As we look out to 2021, COVID continues to present some uncertainty. On the one hand, we believe that the pandemic will accelerate digital transformation and cloud migration once the near-term pressure subsides. However, the timing and path of normalization remains uncertainty. Taking in combination we are initiating the following 2021 guidance, which includes continued high growth. Beginning with the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $185 million to $187 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 42% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.02 to $0.03 per share based on approximately 345 million weighted average diluted shares. For the full-year revenue was expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million, which represents 38% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.14 per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares. Now some notes on the guidance. Embedded in the guidance are prudent assumptions on growth of existing customers as well as new logo attainment, which reflect some of the current macro uncertainties. Next, our strategic focus remains on investing to optimize for long-term growth. Therefore, we\u2019re planning to continue aggressive investments in both R&D and go-to-market throughout 2021. While we have been profitable throughout 2020 and plan to be in 2021, we are not focused on optimizing near-term profitability. Rather the efficiencies of our business are clearly evident and we are confident in our ability to be a sizable materially profitable company over the long-term. Additionally, our model assumes a return to the office and a resumption of travel and in-person events in the second half of the year. We have limited visibility presently on these topics, but believe it\u2019s prudent to incorporate that in our outlook. Next, of the two acquisitions, Timber Technologies has closed and has no impact to our guidance. We also announced the agreement to acquire Sqreen for a total transaction cost of $260 million, of which approximately 25% is deferred in a mix of cash and stock. We expect Sqreen to close in Q2 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Sqreen is not included in our guidance, but we expect it to have an immaterial impact to both our revenue and operating income guidance in 2021 upon deal closure. Now below operating income. We expect approximately $1.2 million of quarterly non-GAAP other income, which is net including the interest income on our cash and marketable securities, less the interest expense of our convertible. Next, we don\u2019t expect to be a federal taxpayer next year, but have a tax provision related to our international entity and expect that tax provision to be approximately $600,000 in Q1 and $3 million for the full-year. Lastly, we have early-adopted ASC 2020-06 as of January 1st, which changes the accounting for our convertible debt. Therefore going forward, our convertible notes will be accounted for wholly as debt on our balance sheet. GAAP and other expenses should now be more aligned to non-GAAP, as there is no longer a non-cash component related to the debt discount. More importantly, our share count forecast now considers an additional 8.1 million shares as the new standard requires all underlying shares of the convert to be included. And this has been taken into account in our EPS guidance. To summarize, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. Execution was very strong, including strong sales results and continued product innovation. Customers continue to consume more Datadog both in terms of usage and the cross-selling to newer products. Our continued execution throughout the challenges of 2020 give us even greater confidence heading into 2021 and the importance of our solutions will only be heightened long-term by the pandemic. Therefore we\u2019re continuing to reinvest in our business and are very excited for the year ahead, sorry. Finally, we would like to thank A.J. who is having his last earnings call with us today at Datadog. I\u2019m sure our investors have appreciated his contributions as much as we have. And with that, we will now open our call for questions. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question, we do have Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. You are now live.\nMark Rende: This is Mark Rende on for Sanjit. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results and continued strong growth here. First, I just want to quickly get an update on the headwinds you\u2019re seeing at the top line from the lower expansion you saw last summer. It seems like those trends have largely turned around and we should expect another quarter or two to kind of work through those impacts. I guess my question is as we get into the back half of the next year and the growth comps become easier, should we be expecting the combination of easier growth comps and ramping kind of products and partnerships with like Azure to result in an acceleration of growth? Is that an appropriate way for us to be thinking about it?\nDavid Obstler: I think that we\u2019ve given our guidance, taking into account all of the potential upsides and risks, but you are right, the headwinds created in Q2 do create a drag on the revenue growth as we talked about, through Q2 of next year, and while we are not providing that quarterly guidance through next year, we expect that headwind in terms of the comp to abate in the second half of the year.\nMark Rende: Got it. Helpful. And then maybe just on the two acquisitions announced. So on the security side with Sqreen you\u2019re building out quite a portfolio now across observability and security at Datadog. And I guess my question on Sqreen is, kind of, how does this integrate with the core Datadog platform? How does it work with core Datadog versus being a standalone functionality? And then on the Timber purchase, what is the need for an observability data pipeline in the platform? Can you help us kind of better understand what timber is bringing to Datadog and in the platform do my customers really need this functionality? Thanks so much. Really helpful.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So I\u2019ll take the question on M&A. So on the Sqreen side, what is really interesting is the focus is application security. And application security is one of the areas where the conflict, I would say, between application and that\u2019s basically ops and security is the most present. And the responsibilities are not really clear-cut in there. We think it\u2019s one of the areas where we can show particular strength because our APM is already deployed, it\u2019s already in the heart of the application, and we can inject the security protection and detection in there directly. So we think this is a product that will make a lot of sense to our customers that are using APM and that\u2019s going to be the products the same way basically. So that\u2019s for Sqreen. For Timber and Vector, which is the product, what\u2019s really interesting there is we hear and we see from customers over and over again that they have a number of different data sources that produce logs in particular, but also other kinds of observability data. And many of those sources are legacy system, log management systems, for example. And one thing they want to be able to do is to aggregate all that data before it leaves their own network environment, make sure they have the right privacy controls on them so they can filter PII for example and things like that and then decide to wrap this data to us for example, back to our cloud service. But also maybe two other places, maybe to an archive they want to keep in-house. So what we think this will allow us to do is to satisfy that need from customers, make sure they\u2019re fully in control of the observability data and make it a lot easier for customers to in the end, send us all the data that is relevant to them.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. You are now live.\nChris Merwin: Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about new land. I think you called out that 75% of those lands are with two or more products. So beyond infrastructure, can you give us a sense of where you\u2019re seeing the strongest traction more recently with the rest of your suite? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: It\u2019s easy, pretty much in the order of introduction of the products. So the most matured behind that are APM and logs, which are neck and neck in terms of which are the other ones that are getting a dash first. And then you go one step down to Synthetics, and then you go one step down to NPM and RUM, and then you go down to security. So that\u2019s the order, which by the way, I think the question we might get later but we\u2019re planning to invest a lot more, because we see so much success with that platform approach. We see all these products have a pretty interesting growth curve and we think there is a lot more prominent space for us to cover, which is why we are aggressively building the team and hiring and also proceeding to these acquisitions.\nChris Merwin: And just a follow-up, if we look at billings, I mean, on a pro forma basis, I think you said it was up 61% RPO, CRPO was up in the mid-60s, but then the revenue guide for \u201921 is in the high-30s. So I realize billings are going to factor in usage. But can you help us think about how to reconcile really strong billings growth we saw exiting \u201920 with the revenue growth guide for \u201921? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. I think we had a strong new logo. We also had as we mentioned an extension of the duration of billings and contracts from our clients. So those were some of the factors that caused the strong performance. We try to get everyone sort of back to the revenue growth and then the linearity within quarter which one can look at ARR, because of the variabilities in billing and RPO due to billings. But we did have strong new sales as well as the extension of duration in the quarter as we mentioned, which contributed to that performance.\nOperator: The next one on the line is Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. You are now live.\nSterling Auty: Wanted to revisit the security topic again. And traditionally when we think about WAF adoption that\u2019s usually been the security CISO organization kind of driving that adoption. RASP is a newer area and what I\u2019m curious is do you need a dedicated security sales force to properly penetrate the opportunity or is there enough buying decision and influence coming out of the DevOps areas that your existing sales force can adequately push the security products that you have?\nOlivier Pomel: So the short answer to that is we don\u2019t know yet. And first of all the deal is not closed yet. Right. So we are sticking into hypothetical but the companies are not merged yet. But the way we\u2019re seeing it is by starting from an APM product we really lowered the friction that is involved in deploying and application security product, which typically is the problem you have. When you try to deploy a RASP product there is a high friction to deploy and the person who wants to deploy it is not the person who actually has the authority to do it or actually managing the server as managing the application, and we saw that Datadog. So we think it opens up new avenues of frictionlessly deploying those products. Now, how we translate on the go-to-market side and if we need to have specialty sale, we don\u2019t know yet and we\u2019re open to it.\nSterling Auty: All right, great. And then one follow-up would be just in the two-plus products you mentioned kind of the land and the adoptions by the maturity curve, but what I\u2019m curious about is, are you seeing the use cases especially for Log and APM driving into newer areas than what you saw, let\u2019s say, maybe three or four quarters ago? Are you getting expansion of those products in particular new areas of your customers?\nOlivier Pomel: So those products are still expanding a lot, right. So the adoption curve for our customer, they usually starts small and then they grow and they expand the products to more and more and more of their business units and various activities. And so Log and APM are not different, but they keep growing with customers that way. So even when we say 70% of the customers have adopted the products, there is still a lot of growth to be had within those customers.\nOperator: Next one on the queue is Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. You are now live.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much and congrats on a strong end to a crazy year. Oli, my question is on Timber. Yes, for sure. My question on Timber is the idea of Vector to be in agnostic data pipeline and to be able to feed data to any observability platform and in that case, how should we think about them rolling that into your offering potentially create competition if you will, amongst observability platforms or am I not thinking about it right to express it that way?\nOlivier Pomel: No, you are right. I mean it\u2019s important for - I guess if you have customers who send all the data from all the sources, they have to have some flexibility to send it to various places, right. So that\u2019s actually part of the mix there. We think it actually makes sense for us to do it. Obviously, the integrated experience with Datadog will be fantastic and so that it makes the most sense and it is the most interesting from a value perspective to in Datadog, but it is important for this to be open to cater to the various use cases where customers have another destination they want to consume the data or another source they want to add or some flexibility to filter on the fly with this end. In a way you can see that as an extension of Logging without Limits, which is back into the customers\u2019 infrastructure.\nBrad Zelnick: And maybe a follow-up for David. David, how should we think about the level of sales hiring this year and the ability to ramp reps on the entire portfolio, which has expanded quite significantly?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, we\u2019ve been successful last year as well as our plans for this year in ramping sales higher slightly ahead of revenues. So we\u2019ve been, as we talked about in the 60%s, we have plans to do it again. And as we\u2019ve talked about it involves both expanding into new geographies, it involves building out the teams within geographies where we\u2019ve been already successful, and it\u2019s what we did last year and believe we can do it again the next year.\nOperator: Next one on the line is Mohit Gogia from Barclays. You are now live.\nMohit Gogia: Thanks for taking my question and all in all congrats on a very strong quarter as well. So my first question is around the Mendix deals that you guys announced last week. So wondering if you can give us more color there. It sounds like Mendix standardizing on Datadog as its observability platform. I think the release also mentioned that you guys replaced the existing incumbents, which were five or six tools that the customer is using. So if you can go into some sort of like the dynamics of your land there or maybe you are already there and expanded from there, but any more color on that customer will be very helpful?\nOlivier Pomel: I actually don\u2019t have much more color I can provide because I\u2019m not sure what I can speak to publicly. We didn\u2019t prepare anything for that. But interestingly enough, this was not one of the customers we mentioned in the rest of the call, in the prepared notes.\nDavid Obstler: But I think as Oli has mentioned it. It has to be a press release, but it\u2019s typical of what has been happening with the expansion of the products across the platform where most of the motion is landing smaller and then expanding given the value of the platform to across the product set. So it\u2019s a typical type of motion.\nMohit Gogia: Understood. My follow-up question is for David. So, David, in terms of - so I think you followed up the record new ARR in Q3 with another strong quarter here in Q4. Right. So if I mean obviously we understand the puts and takes to billings and RPO. But if I just look at ARR, it seems to be things coming together very nicely after looks like a slight or rather a dip in Q2. So, like how should we think about the guidance? I know this question was already asked, but if I sort of compare that to next fiscal year guidance versus really two strong quarters of ARR ad, can you help us reconcile that?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. As we said last time and it\u2019s a typical approach, there is lots of positives and we\u2019re very proud of it. But we continue to take a conservative approach towards guidance, given the uncertainty in the world from COVID and what might happen to enterprises. As we said, we\u2019ve seen a less volatile world in terms of both the growth of client usage and new logos, but continue to remain prudent and conservative when we provide guidance as we have in our quarters as a public company.\nOlivier Pomel: One thing I will say is, when we look at our metrics internally, use that metrics in particular those are still noisier than they were before the pandemic, because they basically track the way the various economical impacts of the pandemic will go through the world, and the right layers of the economy. And so we want to be a little bit cautious there. It\u2019s people\u2019s behavior that\u2019s changed this year. Like it\u2019s fairly different from what it was the year before. An example of that is typically at the last year or the last week of the year there is a drop in activity because pretty much everyone takes the week-offs and some companies turn off their development environments and things like that. This year it was more pronounced, I think because many people haven\u2019t taken any time off during the year and everybody to get time off at that time. So we want to be little bit careful about what we predict in the future. We\u2019ve learned in Q2 that the numbers can change fast as changes in the economy happen.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. You are now live.\nMatt Swanson: This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. Olivier, the strength in multi-product adoption has trended well throughout the year. I know we talk a lot of times about your opportunity being Greenfield rather than displacements. So when we start to talk about more and more customers adopting more and more solutions is this leading you into more of a displacement cycle and how is that kind of affecting your go-to-market strategy and the sales cycles and those upsells?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. We still, I would say just as dominated by greenfield as we were before and I think it\u2019s going to be the case for the foreseeable future, which is why a lot of what we\u2019re doing today is investing in building more products and growing the sales force so we can capture as much of these greenfield market as possible.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then I know security is a newer opportunity. But could you touch on any changes you\u2019ve seen following Sunburst maybe even outside of security? It feels like there might be some elevated concerns for enterprises around observability. And just kind of a renewed focus on knowing what is happening in their environment?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Well it\u2019s both a challenge and an opportunity, right. I think the whole world is asking themselves what was happening with their software supply chain what they were running, which is good. I think it opened some opportunity that some - I would say minor short-term opportunity because we do see some customers that want to replace their network monitoring. And our network device monitoring product is fairly new. But we see some interest in that for that product recently. I think longer term, there is definitely a growing problem that is understanding what is running, understanding your supply chain and understanding what your application is doing and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in security. I think there is going to be a long-term opportunity there. So in short term, some replacements there. But the real opportunity is the longer term and can happen to prices basically was going on in their network and in the applications.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jack Andrews from Needham & Company. You are now live.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Colin] for Jack. Can you provide some color on how your relationship with Azure is progressing and expected ramps in 2021? How should we be thinking about new logo product contribution from the partnership compared to your organic motion given Microsoft\u2019s leverage?\nOlivier Pomel: It\u2019s still not leverage, it\u2019s in preview. So we have some customers that have limited access to it. And we\u2019re expecting this to be live in the first half of the year, but we don\u2019t fully control it. So there is two or three billings out before that. We look it\u2019s hard to tell what the impact is going to be. But hopefully we do expect it\u2019s going to have a positive impact. I don\u2019t want to tell it before it happens. What I will say though is that we already got great feedback from existing customers and prospects that were already in our pipeline that this integration and the partnership with Microsoft is helping them move with confidence with Datadog and expand with us. So we\u2019ve seen a few large customers already react very positive with that. So we are - I would say already pretty satisfied with the impact.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And can you talk about some of the gains you\u2019re seeing from customers who adopt solutions from your marketplace in terms of sales cycles and ease of use? Are you seeing any changes in like cohort behavior given that these customers can derive value from your platform more quickly?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Look the marketplace is selling, you\u2019re right. So there is still quite a bit that needs to happen in terms of the offering there and the breadth of the offering, I would say. But we do have customers.\nUnidentified Analyst: Oli, I think you are on mute, not clear anymore.\nOlivier Pomel: Am I mute? Sorry.\nDavid Obstler: Yes. You are mute. Okay you are back.\nOlivier Pomel: All right. Let me try that again. I was saying that the platform is still fairly new at the marketplace, but we do see some customers that are already adopting applications through the marketplace and completing there Datadog platform with software that we haven\u2019t written in-house, which is very, very interesting. And some of these marketplace deals are actually fairly meaningful. So this is I would say this is an encouraging sign. Again, there is still a lot of work to be done, a lot of building, a lot of partners to recruit in the platform. So still fairly early, but we have some very good validating signs very early on.\nOperator: Next one on the queue is George Iwanyc from Oppenheimer. You are now live.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. So Olivier kind of following up on the strong multi-product adoption, are you seeing any consolidation of the number of tools at your customers and kind of just a broad look at the overall competitive landscape?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Definitely. We mentioned a few examples of customers that are considering on us, right because they don\u2019t want to have their teams jump between tools, they don\u2019t want to have separate tools within the teams. So we definitely see that. In terms of the competitive landscape, it\u2019s a bit boring that we haven\u2019t seen any noticeable change in the past year, I would say. So, pretty much the same situation as it was before where the bulk of the opportunity is with you, a lot of occupancy shown is open source do-it-yourself and then occasionally, we\u2019re going to have some large lands from customers that already had something before and switched to us. But that\u2019s not the dominant motion.\nGeorge Iwanyc: All right. Thank you. And then David, when you talked about the duration extending a bit, when you\u2019re looking at your guidance, do you expect that to either flatten out or start to contract maybe later in the year?\nDavid Obstler: We think that can be episodic with as we talked about with that particular quarter and the contracts that come up. There hasn\u2019t been any change in strategy. Our strategy is to get annual commits and to offer mainly upfront billing with on-demand that\u2019s still the dominant way to go to market. So what happens in the variability is some clients want a multi-year arrangement or they want a certain billing. But we really haven\u2019t changed our assumptions to sort of where we are longer term in terms of duration.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nOperator: Next one on the line is Bhavan Suri from William Blair. You are now live.\nBhavan Suri: Thanks for taking my questions, guys. And I\u2019ll echo my congrats. That was a solid quarter. I guess I just want to touch a couple of quick things here on Synthetics. You started charging for Synthetics, I think it was, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, Q3 2019. You've talked about seeing all attractions, just not to assume what the growth has been in that business, specifically, attach rates, maybe how it\u2019s trending relative to your expectations because you did bring up a little bit in the call, but we think that there is much color, I\u2019d love to hear how that\u2019s doing?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, it\u2019s going very well. I think we talked about the size and growth of the products is really aligned to when they were initiated and we said last quarter we had a tremendous success that Synthetics was multiple tens of millions of dollar type customer early in its growth. Had very strong adoption and that\u2019s been as we talked about sort of the number four product in terms of the size after infrastructure logs and APM together. So we continued to see very strong reception as part of the overall platform. \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. And look we\u2019re very - as I said at the earlier network monitoring and RUM, which were introduced after Synthetics both have adoption at very similar growth curves and a very good curve. So we are optimistic about all those products. Look the curves might differ a little bit between the products because they have different levels of friction, they have different levels of applicability and roadmap would have different depth I would say, but so far we don\u2019t have any bugs in our platform. So we feel good about that.\nBhavan Suri: Okay, good. Absolutely. And then one other one from me. You usually disclose this metric and maybe I got it wrong, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve given the 1 million customer count in previous quarters. I\u2019d love to understand how that trended through the year, and if you saw a budget flush in December, which might have driven a jump in seven-figure deals?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, we said that we would be delivering that once a year and providing some color. So it\u2019s the end of the year. As I think we told you we saw steady growth of that in the year. I think it sort of mimics the rest of the effect in the business where that type of evolution either from land or expand was more difficult in Q2 and improved throughout the year commensurate with our new logo and our expansion.\nOperator: For the next question we do have Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. You are now live.\nJoey Marincek: This is Joey Marincek on for Pat. I was going off that last question, I wanted to dig in on those larger customers. I\u2019m just wondering, has your conversations changed at all to these larger customers, maybe just how you\u2019re approaching them. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: The conversation hasn\u2019t really changed much. I think it\u2019s all in continuity with what has happened in the past, which is that those customers are adopting more and more of our products and they are deploying us more and more broadly and they themselves are getting deeper and deeper into the cloud. So the boundary between customers that are 1 million plus or 1 million, is I mean arbitrary. But we have a large number of customers right above it, a large number of customers right below it and we keep pushing customers up basically. There is nothing new or different there. I think what this speaks to is customers continue to adopt more of our products and more of our platform and they continue to move to the cloud.\nOperator: Next one on the line is Brad Rebeck from Stifel. You are now live.\nBrad Rebeck: Thank you very much. Oli, traditionally you\u2019ve talked about the frictionless adoption of the platform is being a key focus. So as you continue to build out into new areas how important is it to maintain that frictionless type of environment versus taking on some more difficult problems that may include deeper sales efforts upfront? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, we are okay with both, right. But there is a lot we can still do to play to our strength and we are very far from covering the full spectrum of problems we can solve in a completely frictionless way. So in summary, especially security like it\u2019s possible that we will have different kinds of sales and I would say a bit more frictionless deployments. But we\u2019re not done with the addition of frictionless products and the ones that we have today are still very far from being fully penetrated and have a variety of customers. So there is still a very long runway for all of that.\nOperator: Next one on the line will be Michael Turits from KeyBanc. You are now live.\nMichael Turits: Hi, David and Oli. One of your competitors has made some very extensive changes to their pricing structure. Are you seeing any impact from that or any pressure to make any kinds of changes structurally in the way you price?\nOlivier Pomel: We haven\u2019t seen any developments there. No, I think it\u2019s still possible that customers want to change the way they consume. But we haven\u2019t seen anything so far. So as I said, the competitive landscape is boring in a good way so far.\nMichael Turits: And David, just a quick housekeeping. You talked about billings getting some boost from duration extension. Can you quantify that for this quarter?\nDavid Obstler: We are both in contracting billings they were both a couple of months. So both of them had been sort of in the seven to 10, 12, and so they both extended a couple of months. But again, we want to caution everybody that may be related to the bills that went out at the end of the year, etc. And we don\u2019t expect any real changes in the way we\u2019re sort of going to market and interacting with our customers.\nMichael Turits: And what is the invoicing duration on average now, what it\u2019s been roughly?\nDavid Obstler: That range has been sort of in the six to eight range and the contract duration has been a couple of months longer than that and they both expanded. But again, we are not drawing conclusions based on one quarter and caution everybody.\nMichael Turits: So it has been six to eight and it was up a couple of months this quarter on invoicing duration?\nDavid Obstler: Yes.\nMichael Turits: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Next one on the queue is Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. You are now live.\nGregg Moskowitz: So it\u2019s great that the usage trends were good again this quarter and that you are now approximately back to pre-COVID levels and what I was curious about is now that we\u2019re another quarter removed from the Q2 just to get your thoughts on the likelihood of a similar spike in cloud optimization reoccurring at some point. In other words, do you think that we would probably need to see another exogenous shock or long tail type event for usage to move around materially in any given quarter?\nOlivier Pomel: So I don\u2019t know even what is going to happen to the vaccines and the rest of the pandemic. So I\u2019ll defer on that. In terms of the cycles optimization they happen from time-to-time from our customers. Now whether they all got on the same schedule now because they were optimized at the same time, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think all companies work the same way. But again, we don\u2019t know. We want to be a little bit prudent with our numbers, because, as I said they are a little bit noisier than pre-pandemic and we want to set the right expectation there.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thanks, Oli. And then just, David any changes to average deal size of this quarter across either new or existing customers?\nDavid Obstler: We did have more an increase of the new logos, broadly speaking, we have some range of that. So we talked about that was part of our new logo performance in Q4, and over time we have a steady increase of the average spend with our customers, as they grow with us as part of the land and expand.\nOperator: Last question comes from the line of Yun Kim from Loop Capital Markets. You are now live.\nYun Kim: Thank you. So Oli, there was an earlier question on the impact of SolarWinds and Sunburst. Are you seeing that events driving closer collaboration between DevOps and security ops and is that what\u2019s driving somewhat of - \nOlivier Pomel: I\u2019m sorry, I think you got cut off. Should we take the next?\nA.J. Ljubich: Yes, maybe operator we end the call here.\nYun Kim: Oli, have you - \nA.J. Ljubich: Sorry, we are ending the call.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So thank you everyone. Again, I\u2019d like to restate the fact we\u2019re very pleased of our performance in the fourth quarter and as well as the performance for the full-year. And as a closing word, I am very proud of our execution and I want to thank our employees for their hard work in what has been a difficult year for most people. One thing that\u2019s important to remember is that we are more critical to our customers than we were before and the move to cloud is proving to be truly essential. So I and everyone at Datadog are excited to continue to make the lives easier to deliver value to them in 2021 and in the years to come. So thank you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentleman, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thank you, A.J. and thank you all for joining us today. We are very pleased with our performance in Q4, which once again showed high growth at scale and demonstrated efficiencies. Despite the unique challenges presented by COVID, we continued in 2020 to introduce new products at a high velocity, grow top line at a rapid rate and demonstrate strong operating efficiencies. We are in particular, very proud of the way our teams have handled the pandemic as well as other unprecedented challenges. We ended the year with 2,185 employees globally, a 56% increase year-over-year with high growth of both our go-to-market and R&D teams. One of our strategic decisions at the beginning of the pandemic was to keep on hiring and we have been able to interview, hire and onboard remotely while maintaining high employee engagement and productivity. Throughout the year, we have worked to keep our employees safe and productive and to be good citizens of our communities as they face significant challenges. We are very proud of the exceptional grants we have awarded to our employees in Q2 and Q4 both to support them individually and to allow them to donate nearly $1 million to charities focused on COVID reliefs as well as social and racial justice efforts. Last, but certainly not least, we have maintained our relentless focus on delivering value to our customers. And while the pandemic has been a source of challenges to businesses this year, we believe it will prove to be an accelerator of cloud migration and digital transformation over time. In other words we learned a lot this year, including our ability to execute in the face of challenging as well as confirmation of a very large and growing market opportunity. Now, on to a review of the quarter. To summarize Q4 at a high level, revenue was $178 million, an increase of 56% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We also ended the year with 97 customers with an ARR of $1 million or more, almost double the 50 last year and more than three times of 29 we had just two years ago. We ended the year with 1,253 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more up from 858 last year. These customers generated about 75% of our ARR. We have about 14,200 customers, up from about 10,500 last year, which means we added about 1,100 customers in the quarter, making it another strong quarter of ads after the 1,000 we added in Q3. We also continued to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $70 million. As in past quarters, our dollar based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. For the full-year, we generated revenue of $603 million, a 66% increase year-over-year, which was above the high end of our guidance and free cash flow was $83 million or a margin of 14% for the year. Now to review Q4 in more detail. Execution was very strong with outstanding sales performance, particularly against the macro backdrop. New logo generation was very strong, including a new record of new logo AR added that was significantly above last year's number. Very strong performance across the board from commercial and enterprise sales channels as well as a record number of $1 million plus new logo customers. Growth of existing customers was robust, as customers of all sizes continued to grow the usage of Datadog through both increased consumption and cross-selling and Q4's growth of existing customers was broadly in line with pre-COVID trends. Lastly, churn remains very low and consistent with pre-pandemic historical rates. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q4, 72% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 58% last year. Additionally 22% of customers are using four or more products, which is up from only 10% a year ago, and we have another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products. We are very happy with our platform traction including uptake of the newest products, NPM RUM and security, each of which has reached hundreds or thousands of customers in a short amount of time. As a reminder, our newer products are often adopted first by first selecting customers at small scale before our land and expand model enables greater adoption over time. And frictionless adoption from a single integrated platform is a key value proposition for our customers. Overall, our ability to both land and expand in a very challenging time speaks to our strong execution, to our leading product, and to our status as a strategic partner to our customers as they prioritize their digital operations. Now on to product and R&D. Today, we announced two acquisitions. First, we announced an agreement to acquire Sqreen, a SaaS-based security platform that enables enterprises to detect, block and respond to application-level attacks. Sqreen's technology provides runtime application self-protection or RASP, and in-app web application firewall also known as WAF and is already used by hundreds of companies today. Security issue in the application layer are complex to solve because application security causes lines of responsibility between dev, ops and security teams. As a result, we believe this will be a powerful combination for our customers using APM or Synthetics. Next we also announced the acquisition of Timber Technologies, the developers of Vector, a vendor-agnostic and high-performance observability data pipeline. With Vector, customers can collect, enrich, and transform logs, and other signals across multiple tools and data sources in both on-premises and cloud environments, and then route this data to the destination of their choice. We expect this technology to further empower our customers to control their observability data, while providing broader points of entry to a platform. I speak for everyone at Datadog in saying that we are extremely excited for the teams of both companies to join us in our quest to break down silos. Beyond the acquisition, we had a number of new developments in Q4. We launched the general availability of Incident Management, which allows users to declare incidents, investigate root cause and collaborate without leaving Datadog. And we also delivered more than 60 other new capabilities and features across our products, including new and enhanced integrations such as Snowflake, Oracle Cloud or vulnerability analysis monitoring Snyk with our brand new Continuous Profiler. Now taking a step back, we exit 2020 with nine generally available products. To put these in context, just four years ago we had only one product, and we have been able to build the most complete integrated and cloud-native observability platform because of our funding as an integration platform that is extensible to new use cases. Looking forward to 2021, we continue to feel that we're just getting started. First, we are doubling down on building out our platform for observability. This core market alone is a very large opportunity and is growing quickly with a replatforming to cloud architectures. We are still early in this transition and are aggressively adding functionality to both the new SKUs as well as the more mature products. Second, we are just getting started in security with our first product launch in 2020. We consider security a very large opportunity with a long runway of planned product development and we envision the silos between dev, tech and ops working down in a similar way to what we have seen between dev and ops. Third, we are investing in the platform and ecosystem. In addition to building up the Datadog marketplace, we now have strategic partnerships with all of the major cloud vendors. For example, we announced the expansion of our partnerships with Azure and GCP last quarter, which should be in the market in 2021. We are also introducing new cloud instances in regions such as Go Cloud. Our goal is to gain distribution across vendors and regions and in customers where they are to lower friction to adoption and to lower time to value. And as we think longer term beyond 2021, we do believe there may be more use cases we can solve for our customers beyond current reach of our platform. Let's move on to the sales and marketing. As I mentioned earlier, I'm very pleased with the continued productivity of our go-to-market teams, and Q4 was a very strong sales quarter. So let's discuss some of our wins in the quarter. First, let's talk a bit about the way COVID has accelerated digital transformation. As expected in the quarter, we saw a seven-figure AR increases from COVID beneficiaries such as consumer device company, a large e-commerce platform and a global video games company. Perhaps more surprisingly though, we also had a number of notable upsells in companies that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, including a seven-figure upsells with a travel technology company and six figure upsells with two separate airlines as well as a physical event company. These deals demonstrate that Datadog is a key strategic partner to companies that are scaling rapidly over online as well as the [founded] businesses even in the most negatively impacted industries are investing heavily in their digital operations. Now let's dive into some of our other key wins for the quarter. First, I will highlight two notable seven-figure lands both with Fortune 100 companies, a retailer and an insurance company. Both have been struggling with teams in separate silos and are consolidating dozens of tools into Datadog giving a single view to both dev and ops teams. Next, we had a seven-figure land on the streaming sports platform in Asia, which was enabled by our new Datadog partner program. This company adopted the full data platform and our Tracing without Limits approach was a key differentiator as they are previous APM solutions suffered blind spots due to sampling and to a lack of integration with infrastructure data. Next, we had yet another seven-figure land this time from a SaaS company based in India. This company moves to us from a build-it-yourself approach and free its engineers so there could be more products and deliver innovation. Lastly, we had a nearly $1 million upsell to a very large management consulting firm. This company is now using our network direct monitoring products to replace legacy point solution and getting visibility into physical network devices. I would also note that this was one of the first expansion deals to benefit from a brand new marketplace offerings, in this case a partner developed integration with Office 365. Now moving on to our outlook, it is clear to us that the market trends that have driven our success so far have only gotten stronger. Businesses must be digital first like never before. The massive platform driven by cloud migration is still in its early stages and engineers and developers are truly strategic employees whose productivity and ability to collaborate are key drivers of business performance. While there is possibility for more near-term volatility caused by the macro environment, we are increasingly confident in our ability to execute in our long-term opportunity. And we believe that we can continue to sustain strong growth both in the near term and over time. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? Yes. So I'll take the question on M&A. So on the Sqreen side, what is really interesting is the focus is application security. And application security is one of the areas where the conflict, I would say, between application and that's basically ops and security is the most present. And the responsibilities are not really clear-cut in there. We think it's one of the areas where we can show particular strength because our APM is already deployed, it's already in the heart of the application, and we can inject the security protection and detection in there directly. So we think this is a product that will make a lot of sense to our customers that are using APM and that's going to be the products the same way basically. So that's for Sqreen. For Timber and Vector, which is the product, what's really interesting there is we hear and we see from customers over and over again that they have a number of different data sources that produce logs in particular, but also other kinds of observability data. And many of those sources are legacy system, log management systems, for example. And one thing they want to be able to do is to aggregate all that data before it leaves their own network environment, make sure they have the right privacy controls on them so they can filter PII for example and things like that and then decide to wrap this data to us for example, back to our cloud service. But also maybe two other places, maybe to an archive they want to keep in-house. So what we think this will allow us to do is to satisfy that need from customers, make sure they're fully in control of the observability data and make it a lot easier for customers to in the end, send us all the data that is relevant to them. It's easy, pretty much in the order of introduction of the products. So the most matured behind that are APM and logs, which are neck and neck in terms of which are the other ones that are getting a dash first. And then you go one step down to Synthetics, and then you go one step down to NPM and RUM, and then you go down to security. So that's the order, which by the way, I think the question we might get later but we're planning to invest a lot more, because we see so much success with that platform approach. We see all these products have a pretty interesting growth curve and we think there is a lot more prominent space for us to cover, which is why we are aggressively building the team and hiring and also proceeding to these acquisitions. Yes. I think we had a strong new logo. We also had as we mentioned an extension of the duration of billings and contracts from our clients. So those were some of the factors that caused the strong performance. We try to get everyone sort of back to the revenue growth and then the linearity within quarter which one can look at ARR, because of the variabilities in billing and RPO due to billings. But we did have strong new sales as well as the extension of duration in the quarter as we mentioned, which contributed to that performance. So the short answer to that is we don't know yet. And first of all the deal is not closed yet. Right. So we are sticking into hypothetical but the companies are not merged yet. But the way we're seeing it is by starting from an APM product we really lowered the friction that is involved in deploying and application security product, which typically is the problem you have. When you try to deploy a RASP product there is a high friction to deploy and the person who wants to deploy it is not the person who actually has the authority to do it or actually managing the server as managing the application, and we saw that Datadog. So we think it opens up new avenues of frictionlessly deploying those products. Now, how we translate on the go-to-market side and if we need to have specialty sale, we don't know yet and we're open to it. So those products are still expanding a lot, right. So the adoption curve for our customer, they usually starts small and then they grow and they expand the products to more and more and more of their business units and various activities. And so Log and APM are not different, but they keep growing with customers that way. So even when we say 70% of the customers have adopted the products, there is still a lot of growth to be had within those customers. No, you are right. I mean it's important for - I guess if you have customers who send all the data from all the sources, they have to have some flexibility to send it to various places, right. So that's actually part of the mix there. We think it actually makes sense for us to do it. Obviously, the integrated experience with Datadog will be fantastic and so that it makes the most sense and it is the most interesting from a value perspective to in Datadog, but it is important for this to be open to cater to the various use cases where customers have another destination they want to consume the data or another source they want to add or some flexibility to filter on the fly with this end. In a way you can see that as an extension of Logging without Limits, which is back into the customers' infrastructure. I actually don't have much more color I can provide because I'm not sure what I can speak to publicly. We didn't prepare anything for that. But interestingly enough, this was not one of the customers we mentioned in the rest of the call, in the prepared notes. One thing I will say is, when we look at our metrics internally, use that metrics in particular those are still noisier than they were before the pandemic, because they basically track the way the various economical impacts of the pandemic will go through the world, and the right layers of the economy. And so we want to be a little bit cautious there. It's people's behavior that's changed this year. Like it's fairly different from what it was the year before. An example of that is typically at the last year or the last week of the year there is a drop in activity because pretty much everyone takes the week-offs and some companies turn off their development environments and things like that. This year it was more pronounced, I think because many people haven't taken any time off during the year and everybody to get time off at that time. So we want to be little bit careful about what we predict in the future. We've learned in Q2 that the numbers can change fast as changes in the economy happen. Yes. We still, I would say just as dominated by greenfield as we were before and I think it's going to be the case for the foreseeable future, which is why a lot of what we're doing today is investing in building more products and growing the sales force so we can capture as much of these greenfield market as possible. Yes. Well it's both a challenge and an opportunity, right. I think the whole world is asking themselves what was happening with their software supply chain what they were running, which is good. I think it opened some opportunity that some - I would say minor short-term opportunity because we do see some customers that want to replace their network monitoring. And our network device monitoring product is fairly new. But we see some interest in that for that product recently. I think longer term, there is definitely a growing problem that is understanding what is running, understanding your supply chain and understanding what your application is doing and that's why we're investing in security. I think there is going to be a long-term opportunity there. So in short term, some replacements there. But the real opportunity is the longer term and can happen to prices basically was going on in their network and in the applications. It's still not leverage, it's in preview. So we have some customers that have limited access to it. And we're expecting this to be live in the first half of the year, but we don't fully control it. So there is two or three billings out before that. We look it's hard to tell what the impact is going to be. But hopefully we do expect it's going to have a positive impact. I don't want to tell it before it happens. What I will say though is that we already got great feedback from existing customers and prospects that were already in our pipeline that this integration and the partnership with Microsoft is helping them move with confidence with Datadog and expand with us. So we've seen a few large customers already react very positive with that. So we are - I would say already pretty satisfied with the impact. Yes. Look the marketplace is selling, you're right. So there is still quite a bit that needs to happen in terms of the offering there and the breadth of the offering, I would say. But we do have customers. Am I mute? Sorry. All right. Let me try that again. I was saying that the platform is still fairly new at the marketplace, but we do see some customers that are already adopting applications through the marketplace and completing there Datadog platform with software that we haven't written in-house, which is very, very interesting. And some of these marketplace deals are actually fairly meaningful. So this is I would say this is an encouraging sign. Again, there is still a lot of work to be done, a lot of building, a lot of partners to recruit in the platform. So still fairly early, but we have some very good validating signs very early on. Yes. Definitely. We mentioned a few examples of customers that are considering on us, right because they don't want to have their teams jump between tools, they don't want to have separate tools within the teams. So we definitely see that. In terms of the competitive landscape, it's a bit boring that we haven't seen any noticeable change in the past year, I would say. So, pretty much the same situation as it was before where the bulk of the opportunity is with you, a lot of occupancy shown is open source do-it-yourself and then occasionally, we're going to have some large lands from customers that already had something before and switched to us. But that's not the dominant motion. Yes. And look we're very - as I said at the earlier network monitoring and RUM, which were introduced after Synthetics both have adoption at very similar growth curves and a very good curve. So we are optimistic about all those products. Look the curves might differ a little bit between the products because they have different levels of friction, they have different levels of applicability and roadmap would have different depth I would say, but so far we don't have any bugs in our platform. So we feel good about that. The conversation hasn't really changed much. I think it's all in continuity with what has happened in the past, which is that those customers are adopting more and more of our products and they are deploying us more and more broadly and they themselves are getting deeper and deeper into the cloud. So the boundary between customers that are 1 million plus or 1 million, is I mean arbitrary. But we have a large number of customers right above it, a large number of customers right below it and we keep pushing customers up basically. There is nothing new or different there. I think what this speaks to is customers continue to adopt more of our products and more of our platform and they continue to move to the cloud. Well, we are okay with both, right. But there is a lot we can still do to play to our strength and we are very far from covering the full spectrum of problems we can solve in a completely frictionless way. So in summary, especially security like it's possible that we will have different kinds of sales and I would say a bit more frictionless deployments. But we're not done with the addition of frictionless products and the ones that we have today are still very far from being fully penetrated and have a variety of customers. So there is still a very long runway for all of that. We haven't seen any developments there. No, I think it's still possible that customers want to change the way they consume. But we haven't seen anything so far. So as I said, the competitive landscape is boring in a good way so far. So I don't know even what is going to happen to the vaccines and the rest of the pandemic. So I'll defer on that. In terms of the cycles optimization they happen from time-to-time from our customers. Now whether they all got on the same schedule now because they were optimized at the same time, I don't know. I don't think all companies work the same way. But again, we don't know. We want to be a little bit prudent with our numbers, because, as I said they are a little bit noisier than pre-pandemic and we want to set the right expectation there. I'm sorry, I think you got cut off. Should we take the next? Yes. So thank you everyone. Again, I'd like to restate the fact we're very pleased of our performance in the fourth quarter and as well as the performance for the full-year. And as a closing word, I am very proud of our execution and I want to thank our employees for their hard work in what has been a difficult year for most people. One thing that's important to remember is that we are more critical to our customers than we were before and the move to cloud is proving to be truly essential. So I and everyone at Datadog are excited to continue to make the lives easier to deliver value to them in 2021 and in the years to come. So thank you all."

            "name": "David Obstler",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks Olivier. As mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter top and bottom line results amid a difficult macro backdrop. Revenue was $177.5 million, up 56% year-over-year against the challenging year-ago comp. New logo generation was very strong, usage trends were solid, platform traction continued to be strong and churn was in line to better than historical norms. To provide some more context. First new logo results were very strong. Both new logo ARR and the number of new logos were records for Datadog, displaying strong growth versus a year ago. New business contributions came across regions and from both our commercial and enterprise sales channels. Remember that given our usage based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into revenue. Growth of existing customers was robust and our dollar based net retention remained above 130% for the 14th consecutive quarter. We are pleased with the usage growth of existing customers, which showed continued adoption of our platform and their cloud migration even in the face of the macro pressures. To go into a little more detail. Growth of existing customers was broadly in line with long-term trends and meaningfully better than the level experienced in Q2 of last year. As a reminder, even though we have now experienced two quarters of usage growth that was approximately in line with pre-pandemic levels, Q2 was meaningfully pressured and that pressure will impact our year-over-year metrics, including revenue growth and net retention until we lap that compare. Next in the fourth quarter, we saw continued strength of our platform strategy with over 70% of our customers using two or more products, and 22% of our customers now using four or more products, up from only 10% a year ago. Given that 75% plus of our lands now come from two or more products, we believe the overall share of customers using two-plus products is closing in on that number. Lastly, churn was in line to slightly better than historical levels. This demonstrates the importance of our solution to our customers even during challenging times. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the low to mid-90s. Now turning to billings, which were $219.4 million, up 68% year-over-year. After adjusting for the timing of $6 million of billings in last year's fourth quarter pro forma billings growth was 61% year-over-year, strong and approximately in line with revenue growth. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $434 million, up 78% year-over-year. Both billings and contract duration extended in the quarter driven by strong annual billings and commitments as well as a few larger multi-year commits. It is important to note that those multi-year commits were built annually and we do not incentivize our sales force for multi-year deals given our high net retention rate. Current RPO growth was strong in the mid-60s similar to billings growth. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate versus revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the signing of customer contracts while revenue incorporates customer usage. Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $137.6 million, representing a gross margin of 78%. This compares to a gross margin of 79% last quarter and 78% in the year-ago period. The slight decrease in gross margin sequentially is due to minor inefficiencies created from our investments in products and platform innovation. As a reminder, our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter within an acceptable range as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of our cloud data centers in newer geographies. R&D expense was $53.5 million or 30% of revenues, compared to 27% in the year-ago quarter. We have continued to invest significantly in R&D, including high growth of our engineering headcount in which we added approximately 370 net R&D heads over the course of 2020. We have been able to attract talent and execute on hiring and onboarding during COVID. Sales and marketing expense was $52.5 million or 30% of revenues, compared to 35% in the year-ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but the pace of revenue growth has outpaced that investment. This was another quarter of no in-person trade shows or marketing events. While we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead generating activities, it was not on a one-for-one ratio. G&A expense was $13.5 million or 8% of revenues, slightly lower than the 9% in the year-ago quarter and operating income was $18.1 million or 10% operating margin compared to an operating income of $7.9 million with a 7% margin in the year-ago period. The continued reduction in marketing events, travel and entertainment and facilities overhead due to COVID were the primary drivers in the year-over-year leverage. Headcount growth was approximately in line with revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $19.1 million or $0.06 per share based on a 334 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $23.8 million in the quarter. After taking into consider capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $16.7 million for a margin of 9%. For the full-year, free cash flow was $83.2 million or 14% margin. Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter and the full-year of 2021. As Olivier mentioned, we believe we can deliver high growth for the foreseeable future as we are addressing a very large Greenfield market and are executing well against that opportunity. As we look out to 2021, COVID continues to present some uncertainty. On the one hand, we believe that the pandemic will accelerate digital transformation and cloud migration once the near-term pressure subsides. However, the timing and path of normalization remains uncertainty. Taking in combination we are initiating the following 2021 guidance, which includes continued high growth. Beginning with the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $185 million to $187 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 42% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.02 to $0.03 per share based on approximately 345 million weighted average diluted shares. For the full-year revenue was expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million, which represents 38% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.14 per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares. Now some notes on the guidance. Embedded in the guidance are prudent assumptions on growth of existing customers as well as new logo attainment, which reflect some of the current macro uncertainties. Next, our strategic focus remains on investing to optimize for long-term growth. Therefore, we're planning to continue aggressive investments in both R&D and go-to-market throughout 2021. While we have been profitable throughout 2020 and plan to be in 2021, we are not focused on optimizing near-term profitability. Rather the efficiencies of our business are clearly evident and we are confident in our ability to be a sizable materially profitable company over the long-term. Additionally, our model assumes a return to the office and a resumption of travel and in-person events in the second half of the year. We have limited visibility presently on these topics, but believe it's prudent to incorporate that in our outlook. Next, of the two acquisitions, Timber Technologies has closed and has no impact to our guidance. We also announced the agreement to acquire Sqreen for a total transaction cost of $260 million, of which approximately 25% is deferred in a mix of cash and stock. We expect Sqreen to close in Q2 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Sqreen is not included in our guidance, but we expect it to have an immaterial impact to both our revenue and operating income guidance in 2021 upon deal closure. Now below operating income. We expect approximately $1.2 million of quarterly non-GAAP other income, which is net including the interest income on our cash and marketable securities, less the interest expense of our convertible. Next, we don't expect to be a federal taxpayer next year, but have a tax provision related to our international entity and expect that tax provision to be approximately $600,000 in Q1 and $3 million for the full-year. Lastly, we have early-adopted ASC 2020-06 as of January 1st, which changes the accounting for our convertible debt. Therefore going forward, our convertible notes will be accounted for wholly as debt on our balance sheet. GAAP and other expenses should now be more aligned to non-GAAP, as there is no longer a non-cash component related to the debt discount. More importantly, our share count forecast now considers an additional 8.1 million shares as the new standard requires all underlying shares of the convert to be included. And this has been taken into account in our EPS guidance. To summarize, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. Execution was very strong, including strong sales results and continued product innovation. Customers continue to consume more Datadog both in terms of usage and the cross-selling to newer products. Our continued execution throughout the challenges of 2020 give us even greater confidence heading into 2021 and the importance of our solutions will only be heightened long-term by the pandemic. Therefore we're continuing to reinvest in our business and are very excited for the year ahead, sorry. Finally, we would like to thank A.J. who is having his last earnings call with us today at Datadog. I'm sure our investors have appreciated his contributions as much as we have. And with that, we will now open our call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. I think that we've given our guidance, taking into account all of the potential upsides and risks, but you are right, the headwinds created in Q2 do create a drag on the revenue growth as we talked about, through Q2 of next year, and while we are not providing that quarterly guidance through next year, we expect that headwind in terms of the comp to abate in the second half of the year. Yes, we've been successful last year as well as our plans for this year in ramping sales higher slightly ahead of revenues. So we've been, as we talked about in the 60%s, we have plans to do it again. And as we've talked about it involves both expanding into new geographies, it involves building out the teams within geographies where we've been already successful, and it's what we did last year and believe we can do it again the next year. But I think as Oli has mentioned it. It has to be a press release, but it's typical of what has been happening with the expansion of the products across the platform where most of the motion is landing smaller and then expanding given the value of the platform to across the product set. So it's a typical type of motion. Yes. As we said last time and it's a typical approach, there is lots of positives and we're very proud of it. But we continue to take a conservative approach towards guidance, given the uncertainty in the world from COVID and what might happen to enterprises. As we said, we've seen a less volatile world in terms of both the growth of client usage and new logos, but continue to remain prudent and conservative when we provide guidance as we have in our quarters as a public company. Yes. You are mute. Okay you are back. We think that can be episodic with as we talked about with that particular quarter and the contracts that come up. There hasn't been any change in strategy. Our strategy is to get annual commits and to offer mainly upfront billing with on-demand that's still the dominant way to go to market. So what happens in the variability is some clients want a multi-year arrangement or they want a certain billing. But we really haven't changed our assumptions to sort of where we are longer term in terms of duration. Yes, it's going very well. I think we talked about the size and growth of the products is really aligned to when they were initiated and we said last quarter we had a tremendous success that Synthetics was multiple tens of millions of dollar type customer early in its growth. Had very strong adoption and that's been as we talked about sort of the number four product in terms of the size after infrastructure logs and APM together. So we continued to see very strong reception as part of the overall platform. Yes, we said that we would be delivering that once a year and providing some color. So it's the end of the year. As I think we told you we saw steady growth of that in the year. I think it sort of mimics the rest of the effect in the business where that type of evolution either from land or expand was more difficult in Q2 and improved throughout the year commensurate with our new logo and our expansion. We are both in contracting billings they were both a couple of months. So both of them had been sort of in the seven to 10, 12, and so they both extended a couple of months. But again, we want to caution everybody that may be related to the bills that went out at the end of the year, etc. And we don't expect any real changes in the way we're sort of going to market and interacting with our customers. That range has been sort of in the six to eight range and the contract duration has been a couple of months longer than that and they both expanded. But again, we are not drawing conclusions based on one quarter and caution everybody. Yes. We did have more an increase of the new logos, broadly speaking, we have some range of that. So we talked about that was part of our new logo performance in Q4, and over time we have a steady increase of the average spend with our customers, as they grow with us as part of the land and expand."

We are very pleased with our performance in Q3 which showed continued high growth at scale and demonstrated efficiencies. It was an exciting quarter in which we maintain our high velocity of product delivery starting with the new products and features announced at DASH, our annual user conference. We are building on our strong track record of innovation and expanding our lead at the most complete and cloud-native end-to-end observability platform. With the majority of our employees continuing to work from home, I am extremely impressed by our productivity. Our engineers continue to build and ship innovative solutions. Our go-to-market teams continue to efficiently deliver value to our customers, and we continue to hire rapidly across R&D and sales and marketing to best position ourselves for the future. We are strategic partners to our customers like never before as the importance of being digital-first and agile is more pronounced than ever. The companies everywhere are continuing to migrate to the cloud, investing in their digital operations to achieve these outcomes. And as our market opportunity driven by multiple platforming and cloud migration has become clearer during this time, so has our ability to execute against it. Now, on to a review of Q3 results. To summarize Q3 at a high level, revenue was $155 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,107 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 727 last year. These customers generated about 75% of our ARR. We have about 13,100 customers, up from about 9,500 last year, which means we added about 1,000 customers in the quarter, meaningfully more than the 600 in Q2. We also continue to be capital-efficient with free cash flow of $29 million. And as in past quarters, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. Now, to review Q3 in more detail. Throughout the quarter, usage growth of existing customers was robust which was a return to more normalized levels after slower usage expansion in Q2. To be more specific, the pace of usage growth in Q3 was broadly in line with pre-COVID historical levels. As a result, we feel comfortable that some of the rationalized cloud usage from our larger customers that we've seen in Q2 was transitory as many of those customers have now returned to steady growth in multiple consecutive markets [ph]. Strength was also broad based across customers of different sizes and within different industries. In addition to that, new logo generation continued to be robust with customer additions in line with pre-COVID levels and churn remained consistent with historical rates. Taking all of this into account, total ARR at the end of the quarter was a new record for the company making this a very successful quarter. Next our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q3, 71% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 50% last year. Approximately 20% of customers are using four or more products which is up from only 7% a year ago. We had another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products, and we continue to be pleased with the uptake of our newest products, including Synthetics, RUM ,NPM, and Security. I will point out that Synthetics has now been commercially available for about a year. And today, it is used by thousands of customers, has reached eight figures of ARR and continues to be in hyper growth. Adoption of Synthetics has exceeded our expectations, which will attribute to the combination of the strength of the product itself and the product platform. As a reminder, frictionless adoption is a key value proposition of our platform, which we expect would benefit all of our products. To conclude my review of the quarter, our ability to both land and expand during what has been a time of uncertainty demonstrates Datadog\u2019s importance as companies of all sizes and across all industries even in the most challenged sectors are turning to their digital operations as the most strategically important segment of their business. Now on to R&D. We have a proven and long track record of innovation, and our team lived up to that standard in Q3 with the introduction of eight new products and major features at DASH. Those announcements include introduction of the Datadog Marketplace to enable technology partners to build applications on top of our platform; the general availability of Continuous Profiler to measure cloud-level performance to an always-on and low overhead solution; expanding Synthetics to continuous integration and deployment pipelines, which ended testing earlier in the development process. The introduction of mobile Real User Monitoring for both Android and iOS; the general availability of error tracking to aggregate triage and prioritize front end application errors; the beta launch of incident management for develops and security teams, the beta launch of compliance monitoring, which extends our security solutions to proactively notify on misconfigurations and compliance threat [ph], and lastly the beta launch of recommended monitors, a suite of preconfigured curated and customizable alerts. Additionally, we recently announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft currently in public preview, which will make Datadog available to purchase, implement, and use directly from the Azure console and Azure and Datadog sales teams will increase collaboration for cross-selling to enterprise clients. Today, we also announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with Google Cloud Platform, which extends our GCP presence into new regions and enhances our go-to-market collaboration and sales alignment between Datadog and GCP. We believe this partnership along with our existing alliance with AWS demonstrates our leadership in cloud environments as well as the collaborative nature of our relationship with the public cloud vendors. These are just a few of the new features and enhancements we shipped this quarter. Rather than listing them all, I'll conclude on R&D with two main takeaways. First, I am very proud of the continued productivity of our teams. Together, we have not allowed the pandemic and work-from-home to slow down our roadmap. And we have also been able to successfully hire and onboard at scale throughout the challenging times. Second, we continue to deliver the most complete and cloud-native end-to-end observability platform, and yes we are only getting started. Now, on to the sales and marketing. As you know, this quarter we hosted DASH our annual user conference. While this was our first time hosting it in an whole -virtual format, this enabled us to reach a broader audience of over 7,000 attendees, which was more than 5x last year's count. That was a great success bringing together our customers prospects and partners to show the power of Datadog and many of the new products discussed earlier. And I want to give a special thank you to our events and community teams for excellent execution in a quickly environment. Now let's discuss some of our wins this quarter. First, I'll highlight three notable up sales that demonstrate the broad move to digital channels that has been catalyzed by the pandemic and our ability to rapidly scale with our customers. First the 7-figure upsell with a large Latin America e-commerce company that has been handling record level of orders. This company brought down silos and now has hundreds of users in Datadog collaborating around the share view of the IT stack. Next a European on-demand company that has seen its business more than doubled from last year and has grown standard of usage more than 4 times. The company has standardized monitoring on Datadog with a seven-figure deal, featuring all seven of our platform products, including security to enhance real-time threat detection. And last, a U.S. gaming company that has seen material growth in their platform and now has a seven-figure commitment to Datadog. In addition to using all three of our pillars, they are using Datadog to support their server-less architecture, they harness our machine learning to detect anomalies before they occur and they also report on key business metrics to finance and advertising teams. We also had good success with customers from traditional industries that need to transform. We had a six-figure new logo win from a 150 years old postal service in Europe. This organization aims to deliver more digital services to its customers, while undergoing a transition to a multi-cloud and containerized environment. They are using four products including Synthetics to monitor back to front-end across both on-cloud and on-premise environments. Next, we had a sizable upsell to a European financial service institution. After joining as a customer just over a year ago, this company increased spend more than 4 times for their consolidated monitoring on Datadog to now exceed $1 million in ARR. Finally, we had an upsell with a 100-year-old global shipping company, which we mentioned on last year's call for Q3. Back then, this customer was spending mid-six figures on Datadog infrastructure monitoring. Today this customer's ARR has crossed into seven figures, using infrastructure monitoring, APM, logs, Synthetics RUM, NPM and Security. This is a great example of not only how companies of all stages are undergoing digital transformation, but also of our powerful cross-selling motion as we introduce new products to market. Now moving on to our outlook. As we look ahead to the final quarter of 2020, we continue to be excited about the market opportunity ahead of us and we are confident in our ability to execute, given continued strong performance through challenging times. After some of the rationalized cloud usage which was in Q2, we've seen a clear return to normalized unit growth. It is apparent that cloud migration is not only resilient in the current environment, but may even grow stronger longer term. Companies globally and across all industries are prioritizing digital operations like never before. And the cloud is a clear strategic winner to enable greater agility and innovation. We continue to believe Datadog is a primary beneficiary of this trend and that we remain very well positioned to win in the market. In other words, while the near-term macro environment remains uncertain and could cause bumps along the way, we are very confident in the long-term opportunity and in our positioning. And we believe that we can continue to sustain strong growth, both in the near term and over time. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? \nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we delivered strong third quarter top and bottom line results, amid a difficult macro backdrop. Revenue was $154.7 million, up 61% year-over-year. Usage trends were robust and return to more normalized growth after the pressure that we saw in Q2. Meanwhile, platform traction continued to be strong. New logo generation was robust and churn was in line with historical norms. To provide some more context; first, on usage, usage from existing customers was robust. And our third quarter dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 13th consecutive quarter. After some pressure seen in Q2, driven by optimization efforts from larger customers at scale in the cloud, Q3 was characterized by a decisive return to more normalized growth from our existing customers. Throughout the quarter, we saw usage growth that was more in line with pre-pandemic historical levels. The trend was broad-based and sustained throughout the quarter. This provides us with confidence that what we experienced in Q2 was a transitory optimization effort that were related to the challenging macro environment. While further optimization may happen periodically, as we've talked about previously, we feel confident that cloud migration is very much intact and perhaps even strengthening longer term. Recall that we have a ratable SaaS model. Therefore, while Q3 usage growth was back to pre-COVID levels, the pressure experienced in Q2 can still be seen in our year-over-year comparisons for a number of quarters. Our powerful land and expand model continues to be driven by both usage growth of existing products, as well as the cross-selling to our newer solutions. Next, in the third quarter, we saw continued strength in our platform strategy with over 70% of our customers using two or more products and about 20% of our customers now using four or more products, up from only 7% a year ago. Continued product traction is being driven by adoption in the initial land as well as strong cross-selling. The newest products continue to perform well growing run rate quarter-over-quarter. I note that many of them such as RUM, NPM and Security are still early and therefore small contributions to results in the quarter. Next, new logo results were solid with customer additions in line with pre-COVID levels and strength across sales channels and regions. And lastly churn was stable, in line with historical levels and improved from the slight elevation seen in Q2. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the low to mid-90s. Now turning to billings, which were $155.9 million, up 39% year-over-year against an exceptionally difficult compare. We have said that we will provide a pro forma to more clearly align billings growth with the economics and growth of the business. And in Q3 there were a number of timing and duration differences that affected the growth of billings in the quarter. First, on last year's Q3 call, we had disclosed that there was an invoice timing difference, which increased billings by $6 million. Pro forma excluding that bill billings would have been $106.4 million. Next, in the quarter, we had an $11 million impact to billings and deferred revenue from a few long-term large customers, which moved from annual billings to semiannual or shorter duration upon their renewals. Notably all of these customers continue to commit on an annual basis. They're simply breaking up their bills as we talked about on the last call into smaller increments. If we pro forma for these timing effects, Q3 2020 billings would have been $166.9 million. So now, comparing the pro forma billings of $166.9 million to the year ago apples-to-apples of 106.4%, the growth is 57% relatively in line with revenue growth. Remaining performance obligations or RPO was $316 million, up 50 per year. Current RPO growth was similar to pro forma billings growth. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate as we've just discussed versus revenue based on the timing of invoicing and signing of customer contracts while revenue incorporates customer usage. Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder unless otherwise noted all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials release. Gross profit in the quarter was $121.5 million representing a gross margin of 79%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and 76% in the year ago period. Year-over-year improvement in gross margin was driven by more efficient use of cloud infrastructure. The slight decrease in gross margin sequentially was due to minor inefficiencies created from our investments in products and platform innovation as we have discussed. As a reminder, our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter within an acceptable range as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies. R&D expense in the quarter was $45.8 million or 30% of revenue compared to 28% a year ago. We've continued to invest significantly in R&D including high growth of our engineering headcount. We've been able to attract talent and execute on hiring and onboarding, enabling us to deliver multiple record quarters of engineering headcount additions. We continue to see a meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $49.7 million, or 32% of revenue compared to 39% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but the pace of revenue growth continues to outpace that investment. This was another quarter of no in-person trade shows or marketing events. While we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead-generating activities, it was not on a 1:1 ratio. G&A expense was $12.1 million or 8% of revenue, slightly lower than the 9% in the year ago quarter. And operating income was $13.8 million, or 9% operating margin, compared to operating income of $726,000 or 1% in the year ago period. In addition to the improvement in gross margin, the continued reduction in marketing events, travel, and entertainment and facilities overhead due to COVID contributed to operating margin. Headcount growth was approximately in line with revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $16 million, or $0.05 a share on 333 million weighted average diluted shares. We have a very efficient business model, and have experienced a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have delivered five consecutive quarters of breakeven or positive operating income, we note that our priority remains top line growth, and we intend to continue aggressive investments in R&D and go to market. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $36.3 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $28.6 million in the quarter, or a margin of 19%. Cash collections have been very strong amid COVID, a testament to the importance of our solution to our customers. Now, I would like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020. While we saw usage growth in Q3 that was consistent with pre-pandemic historical levels, the pandemic is still ongoing and uncertainty remains. Therefore, we are being prudent by factoring into our guidance, usage growth trends below what we have seen in Q3 and conservative new business assumptions, as well as continued strong investment in R&D and sales and marketing. Beginning with the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $162 million to $164 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 43% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $3 million to $5 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.01 per share positive to $0.02 per share based on an approximately 335 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year 2020 revenue is expected to be in the range of $588 million to $590 million, which represents 62% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $48.5 million to $50.5 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.18 per share based on approximately 332 million weighted average diluted shares. Then some notes below operating income, we expect approximately $1.9 million of quarterly non-GAAP other income, which is net including the interest income on our cash and marketable securities less the interest expense on a convertible debt. And we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer again, but have a tax provision related to our international entity, which we estimate to be approximately $450,000 in Q4. To summarize, we are pleased with the results for the quarter. Usage growth was strong, as companies are prioritizing cloud migration and digital transformation more than ever, and we continue to execute at a high level. We delivered an impressive velocity of product innovation in the quarter, and are investing to continue that track record. While uncertainty related to the macro environment remains, we feel very well positioned to capture what is a large and growing long-term market opportunity. And now with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSanjit Singh: Hi, thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the Q3 results. David, maybe just to start with you. I think the message I heard off the script was a pretty emphatic view from your guidance perspective that the cloud rushing that you saw certainly improved and then became less of an issue. Expansion trends look like they've gotten back to pre-COVID levels. If you could just bridge for us, the slower revenue growth sort of in the low 60s versus the 80s, but at the same time I think you mentioned or I think Olivier mentioned, a record new ARR quarter. And if I look at kind of the RPO based bookings, it seems like there's an acceleration there. If you could sort of just help us understand how those three metrics sort of tied together and give us a sense of whether the business is truly rebounding versus what seems like slower revenue growth?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. We had, as we mentioned, organic growth is a very strong contributor and that rebounded particularly in the larger customers to more historical trends. And we continue to have new sales in line. It's a combination of the two that contributed to the record ARR growth. And so, those are the main factors. The organic is always the majority of the growth in a quarter complemented by the new business.\nOlivier Pomel: And just to complement on that, this is Olivier. If you compare it to last year, so one thing to remember is we have a ratable SaaS model. So the growth we did forego in Q2 is going to be with us in the year-to-year comparison a little bit. Last year at the same time we had an acceleration also, which makes it for a tougher compare. And it's going to \u2013 the increases in ARR only show up in revenue when they're actually incurred in the usage. So it depends on when we added those in the quarter and also put the flexibility of ARR was in Q2. So basically this is how you bridge the record ARR with the revenue as it [indiscernible].\nSanjit Singh: Okay. Understood. That makes sense. And then Olivier, on the partnership which you signed a follow-on partnership with Google Cloud that you announced today, and then you signed another strategic partnership with Azure sort of intra-quarter. On the Azure front, can you sort of frame out what the opportunity is here? Give us a sense of what Azure represents as part of the business today. And with the ability of customers to sort of draw down on their Azure credits using Datadog, how much of an opportunity is this in terms of sustaining revenue growth or potentially accelerating revenue growth with this Azure partnership? If you can just to sort of frame out the opportunity for us that would be great.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So, first all, I should say we already have customers non-stop [ph] providers. We've been working with them before. So today our customer distribution follows a little bit the arrival of the cloud providers. So, we still have many more customers and more revenue volume on AWS, for example than we do in Azure. We \u2013 what's interesting with this new partnership is that we get more tightly integrated into the Azure console itself and we're the first vendor to do that. What's interesting there is the user base for Azure tends to be a bit more homogeneous or used to be a bit more homogeneous in the technology they use mostly for Microsoft. And so the ability to be more integrated with Microsoft really can reduce friction and help onboard new customers onto our platform. So we see that as a great opportunity to get more customers and more usage from Azure as Azure itself is growing and as their customers are diversifying their tech stack. I should say that this is only one of the cloud providers we're working with. We have \u2013 we're active on all of the other platforms. We announced another partnership with GCP today. We have another one with AWS. So this is an evolution not a revolution. To your point also, our customers can use their Azure credits and there will be some cross-selling involved with the Microsoft team. So, we're excited about the lift in go-to-market there. One last thing to remember is that this is still in preview. So the -- we don't expect any significant volume fallout in the near term. That's something that's going to kick in over the next few quarters.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. Thank you, Olivier. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSterling Auty: Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Oli, you kind of answered it with your last comment there, but I just want to make sure that we level set in terms of the timing of the ramp of the partnerships not only for Azure, but also what you announced with Google as well. How should we think of the timing of that flowing into revenue?\nOlivier Pomel: It's not going to be immediate, all right? So the Azure one is just in preview right now. It's not completely live yet. The GCP partnership involves a number of new technical things that need to happen, but also some new go-to-market motions we're putting in place. So, there's not going to be an immediate impact, but we see that as being potentially meaningful contributed in the mid to long-term.\nSterling Auty: That makes perfect sense. Thanks. And just one follow-on to that. Are we looking at across the three pillars or just specifically for infrastructure on both of these partnerships?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, the entry point for most of our customers is usually infrastructure. But the -- as we mentioned earlier in the call, in 75% of the cases, it also comes in with [indiscernible] of our products. So we see that really as a get way into the platform and then a way for us to have customers use all three or four products in the end.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nChris Merwin : Okay. Thanks very much for taking question. I was hoping you could talk a bit about what you saw across the customer segments in the quarter. I think you mentioned that the strength was pretty broad-based. But I guess within the enterprise segment specifically are you starting to see more standardization around the Datadog platform not just with infrastructure obviously, but the log APM? And of course there's much, much broader suite of products that you now offer?\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. That's definitely what we see. I mean, we see -- I think, it's very obvious for customers that they need to integrate various parts of observability together and then having all that on top of the same platform is desired outcome. So we see more and more of that, but it's not specific to the enterprise. We see that happening over all segments at this point. \nChris Merwin : Great. And maybe just a follow-up. In terms of usage stepping back up it's very encouraging to hear. As you talk to customers, is there any pushback on pricing? I mean, I would think not given that you're saying usage step back up here, but just curious what those conversations have been like and how you're thinking about the pricing model from here. Or is there something that really works well for your customer base as it is and there's unlikely to be any evolution of that? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. Look the one thing I should say is anytime you charge customers for millions of dollars, they're going to ask questions about the price. It's the whole department in enterprises that are built just for that. That being said at the end of the day what matters is how much value you deliver for that price. And I think for that we're doing a pretty good job. I think the one thing everybody is grappling with and as more and more applications moving to the cloud and those applications generate more and more data, what's the best way to align how is that is being used for observability reasons, for security reasons other reasons to align that with all the value with the price being paid. And when you look at our product offering and what we've been adding that's why we've added all of these new SKUs to really unbundle what we're doing with the data so customers can really buy to align with the needs they have. For example, we announced more recently treating without limits, which is a way to send extremely large amounts of data to our APM, but only retain the part of it that actually makes sense to customers and they want to retain long-term. We've done the same thing with before. We're doing something with our infrastructure product. These are the way we basically put our customers in control so they can align what they pay with the value they get.\nChris Merwin : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much, and congrats on another strong quarter and really nice to see usage growth returning to more normal levels. David, as investors try to think about the growth algorithm for Datadog in the years to come, clearly, you're levered to digital transformations and cloud migration. And we can look to many proxies for this opportunity perhaps the growth rates of the large public clouds themselves which by the way great to see the deeper partnerships with Microsoft and Google. But I'd be curious to know how internally from a planning perspective, how you all think about this? And although I get you're not going to give us guidance right now for next year, how should we think about how you're framing it and the rate of investment against that opportunity? And along with that how would you characterize the ability to hire in this environment? \nDavid Obstler: Yes. Yes good question. So on revenue, we said that over -- about 60% of our revenue growth comes from existing customers. So we start with the land and expand and look at those cohorts inorganic. And I think we referred to looking at pre-pandemic and historical trends. So that's at the sort of lynchpin making the business relatively predictable even in uncertain times. And then we look at the market size, the opportunity which tends not to be a limit. And so what is, is that the execution, how many salespeople we get in how we can ramp them etcetera. And we then essentially have some experience in understanding ramp and understanding productivity. And those are the algorithms we use in looking at growth. I think we feel and we said this over and over again that there's a very big market and we're very early on. So both in terms of product investment, but also in go to market there's a lot of areas that we are still building out. There are a lot of opportunities. There are a lot of successful territories where we have to put more feet on the street. So we tend to build that from a bottom-up with sales headcount. And that's resulted in sales and capacity as we've talked about in the 60% to 70% growth. And we see that and we see that opportunity and based on our success in bringing people in and getting them productive. As Oli mentioned we have been successful in COVID in hiring and it hasn't really held us back. We've seen a lot of good opportunity and continue to do that throughout the pandemic. \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. And I'll complement that. Sorry, I'll just complement that on the growth side. I mean right now we're so early in the opportunity that the way we think about the way we grow our team isn't directly related to the way we think about the growth we're going to get next year. We really think of it in terms of how fast we can grow them while optimizing for both short-term and long-term growth. So we are growing the team as fast as we can basically and we think there's enough opportunity to justify it. And that's true both on the R&D side and on the sales and marketing side which we are in and we are very convinced that the opportunity is there. And just to put that into -- to frame that a little bit we're growing a lot faster than the cloud providers as a whole which would mean plenty, plenty of market for us to get. \nBrad Zelnick: Thank you for that. Maybe just a follow-up and perhaps put a finer point on this correlation of sales headcount growth with top line growth, just as the portfolio continues to expand especially recently with DASH all the new product announcements, how should we think about the evolution of the sales force to drive efficient cross-selling and specialization that might be required in order to hit all the different buyers and cover all of the product capabilities within the customer base? Are there -- do you envision having to make any significant changes in the go-to-market? \nOlivier Pomel: It's very possible. Every company that -- which is a large scale and grows at some point start specializing their sales force. We haven't had to do that at this point. And I would say, we're optimistic that for the observability part of the stack at this point we'd be very successful at having one sales team sell that. I think the issue might come first for the new categories we're entering such as security where the barriers might be a little bit different. There again these products are new enough. And the customer base is for these products and the I would say the customers for which these products are mature not are a small enough group targeting enough group that we don't need to specialize for 30 years that's definitely something that's on our minds for the future. \nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thanks so much for the thorough explanation today. Congrats again.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Two quick questions and congrats from me as well. Olivier like what are you seeing in terms of competitive dynamics? So we had like some one wonder in your \u2013 in the broader space is kind of bring pricing down like crazy and it's doing a lot of free stuff. Other guys are just trying to broaden the portfolio coming up with new cloud product \u2013 just a word on what are you seeing in that space?\nOlivier Pomel: So broadly, there's no change. The space is very much the same as it's been for the past few years. We don't see anything different today with customers. We don't see anything different in the adoption cycle. We hear a lot about it so around earnings time. But that's about it.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then as you think about like as you kind of look at the landing motion and \u2013 more the landing motion with all your new customers have you seen like a change in terms of what people are taking up? You mentioned at the beginning of the call, a couple of extra stats around how many modules et cetera. But do you see a change in nature in terms of people understanding observability better and kind of going from more than just infrastructure and just kind of thinking more about this whole thing holistically. What are your observations there? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. This definitely customers expect definitely to get to do more with observability than just infrastructure, I would say. The field is there. It's understanding what it needs better there. At the same time, when we land with customers, the balancing act is between having them use more products on day one, but also slowing down the landing which is why the number has been pretty stable around 75% of the land that, include two or more products. I think that corresponds to the right balance right now between landing fast and landing with more than one product. Again, landing fast is critical. Like it's a very important part of our business and we've been very successful with our infrastructure products in particular.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Congrats.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question. At DASH, it was really good to hear the application marketplace going GA really seems to open up a nice halo effect for developers to build application on your platform. Can you talk a little bit more about what sort of interest you're having from developers? And ultimately, you're not alone in software vendors doing this. How do you think about monetizing this? Or is it more of just trying to build up more awareness for additional features that you don't deliver as first-party features yourself?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, it's a collection of all of these, right? I think, we're still super early in this. At this point, we're working with our very first few partners to make sure that we define \u2013 we develop the platform in a way that serves go to them. And we think, if we make them successful, they'll make us successful in the long run. So as far as monetization comes in, we worry about them more than we worry about us at this point, just to make sure they're successful and they get what they want out of it. So super early, we think it's important. We think it's going to play a dividend in the future but we have many, many, more quarters of innovation to come on these to fully deliver on the business.\nMatt Hedberg: That's great. And then maybe just one for David, your explanation of billings was super helpful. Just trying to \u2013 kind of think about that on a normalized basis given all the nuances from Q3 of last year. I guess, I'm curious though, when we look at deferred revenue this quarter and maybe there's an obvious answer to this. But it looked kind of sequentially flat. Was there anything that impacted deferred this quarter not necessarily looking on a year-over-year basis but just sequentially from Q2 to Q3?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. It's the same factor that resulted in the pro forma analysis. There were $11 million of billings from some large customers that had \u2013 would have been 100% in billing, which were chunked up anywhere from semi-annual to monthly billing. So the way to look at that, and do the apples-to-apples would be at that same $11 million, which reflects the economics, and you'll see the deferred revenue in the mid-50s like the other metrics that we talked about.\nMatt Hedberg: I got it. So really just a relic of what happened last year then repeating itself this year the renewals?\nDavid Obstler: Exactly. It's \u2013 its deals that renewed annually and grew and as we said last time that we're trying to work with our clients, keep the commitment. These are some very long term large customers, who are staying with us, but to accommodate them in this environment in their request to chunk up build that's what it is.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. Makes a lot of sense. Thanks guys.\nDavid Obstler: Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: And just a point on that. We'll see more of that in the future, right? I mean the beauty of our model is because of the efficiency of our go-to-market, we don't actually care if customers pay us upfront; we want to align with them on that. And so we're -- I'm pretty sure we'll see more of that as we grow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill: David, I'm curious if you could just expand on the normalization comment, you mentioned from Q2 to Q3 add a little more detail in terms of just overall customer behavior. And I'm curious if you could also just drill down on the security initiative what you're seeing there and what metrics are standing out to you from that business unit? Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. Let me just go over some of the metrics around organic growth and then Oli to Security. So what we said in Q2 was that we had some of the larger customers rationalize. So, therefore, the slowdown of organic was concentrated first in the larger customers and that about 10% of our customer base and ARR was in impacted industries where there was some pressure. And what we saw in Q3 was sort of return to normalcy in those, meaning the larger customers continue to now after that optimization grow in pre-pandemic rates. And we also saw that the COVID impacted -- the impact was taken the medicine was taken and they also continue to be stable to slightly up. So essentially it was across enterprise mid-market and SMB. And it was across also the large customer the small customer that exhibited similar types of organic growth, which is what we've seen over the long period in the company but saw a different effect in Q2. Oli on Security?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. On Security, I think it's too early to have a lot to share there, but the product is growing very nicely. We're getting great adoption stories from customers but it's growing very quickly from a very small number. So -- and it's still very early in its life cycle. So we fleshed out the offering a little bit at DASH with the compliance product. There's a lot more we're working on both of the existing base and on new base for security, so let's say it's still early. And just to restate some of what David said on the growth, we're very happy with the growth we've seen in Q3. It really showed a reversion to normal for the month-to-month growth. I mean if you look at the most growth in ARR any of the month in Q3 like it could have slowed this month in Q3 or Q4 -- sorry in Q4 or Q1 they would have sit right there. So I think it's not that we're very happy with what we've seen. At the same time, we're still very careful about because we don't -- in the macro backdrop, we still question what can happen towards the end of Q4.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Majek with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nRobert Majek: Great. Thanks. As part of the continual shift to a more multi-silo approach, curious if you could elaborate on the experience for results you've had as of late penetrating further into the log monitoring pillar?\nOlivier Pomel: Into the log monitoring, you said?\nRobert Majek: That's correct. \nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. I mean look the log product is in hyper growth right? And it's a very exciting and also a challenging one for customers because it's one of the products, for which is the easiest to generate a lot of fairly useless data and have to pay for it, which is why a lot of the innovations we've made initially on that product were around giving customers more control to align what they pay with the value they get. So we've done quite a bit of that. As we keep growing that product we're getting into situations where customers are not standardizing on us for all of their observability including logs. And we've been basically pulled by our enterprise customers to add a lot of the enterprise features that they would expect from a platform that they and all of their extremely confidential data into. So that's a lot to do what we've been doing more recently.\nRobert Majek: And I know we're just three months out of DASH, but how has customer feedback been so far and some of the new announced products and features? What's resonated the most with customers? \nOlivier Pomel: It's interesting because it's -- we've announced many new products and they all got quite a bit of attention. I would say we've got quite a few eyes on the new incident management product which is only in beta. We've got a lot of excitement for the profiler product. So, there's a number of different things that customers are excited about from DASH. I think we still have in all of those cases it's still early for those products. So, we still have to fully bring them to market. For most of them we still have to charge for them. And we have to basically work with our customers to make sure that these products fully deliver on their promise and our vision. But that's the way we build, right? The way we build is we build with our customers. We put the products in their hands. We make sure they see the value. We make sure they have the controls so they can align what they pay with the value they get and then we grow those customers on those products. \nRobert Majek: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Ollie as your product set continues to diversify and the revenue stream with it, do you think that has any impact on gross margin longer term? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Today we don't think so. There's no reason to think we're going get this in the model we have so far. We might still see some fluctuation mostly because of the back and forth between building more products and optimizing our use of the infrastructure because they are the same engineers that do both and also because of our expansion to new geographies and new data sets and things like that which might push down a little bit. But there's no reason to believe that we're headed into a completely different ZIP code there at least not today.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is now open.\nJack Andrews: Great. Thanks and congratulations on the results. I was wondering if you could just perhaps frame for us what percentage of your deals today are partner sourced and just how we should be thinking about new logos that could be generated from your partnership ecosystem given the launch of your partner network I think in January of this year.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, today it's a very small part of our business that is partner-sourced. And so all of the partnerships we've discussed are basically all upside for us. And that's why we're investing in all of those. We think there's a number of we can get thanks to these partners. And we're investing in the partner organization in general. We launched our partner program earlier this year. It's starting to see a bit amount of success but it's still a small part of the business. \nJack Andrews: Okay. Thanks. And then if I could ask as a quick follow-up could you describe some of the if you need to make some go-to-market changes in particular to scale your federal business and how we should be thinking about how big this business could become relative to some of your other vertical markets?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So we started building a team for that right? And we are as you know we have a number of things in process for FedRAMP and et cetera. We think it's going to be similar in many ways to the way we sell to other customers and different in a few other ways. In terms of the importance of the business, we think it can be a big part of the business. And if you look at other communities in comparable spaces like it is a big part of their business but providers or other vendors in security or observability. So, we believe that there's really a good opportunity there. So, again, this is all upside for us.\nJack Andrews: Got it. Thanks for your perspective and thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Oli, I'll start with you on the cloud partnerships that you've talked about and mentioned before. Can you highlight what's unique? Or \u2013 first of all is there anything exclusive in those relationships, number one? And number two, in what way will it be either easy or difficult for some of your competitors to replicate either the quality of the relationship or the depth of the relationship with those client guys? \nOlivier Pomel: Well I mean there's nothing exclusive in most of these relationships, right? But in many situations like the way they are implemented and what the [indiscernible] is really different. And they're also different depending on the cloud provider we work with. So for example, the way we integrate \u2013 we're going to integrate with Azure plugs directly to their console which is not the case with some of the other cloud providers. So that's something that's interesting there. Now in terms of what others could or could not do it's hard for me to comment. I mean I believe that it's software so we can do it. Others might be able to do it. I think what we've proven time and time again is that, because of the overall structure of our products, because of the structure of our customer base not go to market, we end up having a product that is a lot easier and has a lot of traction to adopt and ends up being more widely adopted by our customers and more successful in the end. And I think that's what we \u2013 that would guide basically the way we run all those partnerships. So what attracted us to the edge partnership with the ability to reduce friction there. And that's why we decided to invest in that first.\nIttai Kidron: That's great. And then David a question for you again, sorry going back to that duration on that large customers, the $11 million. Can you at least confirm that those customers have expanded at your \u2013 roughly your net dollar expansion rate? Just trying to make sure that this isn't just taking a bill and splitting it by half but he was taking a bigger bill and splitting it by half? \nDavid Obstler: Yes. No they've been customers that have grown substantially. One of them is a customer that's more than doubled over the last year or so. So this is merely that we have changed the billing terms but they are all customers that have been growing with us over the last few years.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. And then lastly on your underlying assumption for some softness in usage in your 4Q guide, half pretty much into the quarter. It doesn't sound like there has been any unusual usage softness in that 1.5 months, correct me if I'm wrong. So aren't you just being a little bit too conservative here? I mean what is it the scenario that truly worries you with so little time left in the quarter?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. I think just overall we've tended to be conservative in our guidance to incorporate usage growth rates that are lower than what we have seen and new logo accumulation that's lower. And I think we said last time, that given that velocity and the fact that we're in the pandemic and we can't predict what might happen around the world, we wanted to continue to roll that conservatism forward. So it's really that at the core of the guidance rather than anything that in particular that we've seen that's different than what we said on the call today.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Good luck, guys.\nDavid Obstler: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nBhavan Suri: Hey, gents. Thanks for taking my question. Olivier, I guess I'll touch on first a little bit about the technology architecture. This comes up a lot even we're talking to investors. Maybe a little help in understanding. So today when you look at sort of even the infrastructure monitoring space and the way data works in the sampling model with logs, which data makes sense or it doesn't. But this is idea that with sampling you're not getting all the data and some of the vendors in other markets are saying, we can absorb all the data. How do you think about that? And would it be difficult for you to absorb all the data? Is that too much data with the\u2026.?\nOlivier Pomel: We totally absorb all the data. We totally absorb all the data. Absolutely. There's no sampling. Sampling is something customers can choose to do if they don't want to retain everything and store everything. But absolutely, we take all the data. And actually one thing we announced recently with our treating without limit product. It actually allows us to be -- we're the only ones to actually take absolutely 100% of the data sent to our infrastructure and available in the real-time even in extremely high volume environment and then we go to environments where they're keeping track of millions and millions of requests per second. So we do that and it's not something that the other vendors don\u2019t do. So we -- there's no sampling required. Sampling it's just the way for customers to decide, hey, the millions and millions of debug logs, my developers are sending, I only need to keep 10% of them to see what's going on as they written that in storage for a longer time and for many checks without having to pay for that.\nBhavan Suri: Great. I appreciate the clarity. And my second one is kind of a more longer-term question, but it's about the machine learning. So, some of the other vendors in marketing heavily the focal point of machine learning. And I'd love to understand sort of how you think about that vis-\u00e0-vis competition? And so to what extent are you seeing APM customers, especially leverage the Watchdog automatic anomaly detection service you introduced maybe news last year, 12 months ago. So I'd love to understand a little bit of the thought process there.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. So, a couple of ways in the case. So the first one is we actually think it's a because of the model and we are fully SaaS, machine learning is a strength of ours, because we actually see all of the data we can train or algorithms of all of the data. We can seek to choose the problems and the use cases that we want to solve with machine learning, which is the ones that we don't. So it actually strengthens the long-term structural strength for what we do. That being said, we don't like to lead with the promise -- the promise of an AI that teaches everything for you, because we think in general those promises under deliver. They look great in the demo. But then a number of specific states you're going to find them to fall short and that's not what we want. And that's true of pretty much all the products you see there today. So our approach is to basically under-promise and over-deliver and we think we have long-term structural strength in there because of the way run of products and the data line that we see, which is not something that most of us competes can do or have. Now in terms of the adoption, we see -- we've been purposefully selective in the situation in use cases we saw with Datadog today. But we see without being used by our customers in real situations and they rely on it and that's something that we keep building upon.\nBhavan Suri: Got it. Got it. Thanks for the color. Congrats and thanks for the commentary you've done.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nowinski : All right. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a quick clarification on the billings. I understand the larger customers are growing at pre-pandemic levels and your COVID-impacted companies are slightly up. So it sounds like the environment and the usage, the cloud usage significantly improved from Q2 to Q3. But I'm wondering if you look at your billings on a sequential basis after -- even after normalizing that is only up $6 million sequentially despite that significant improvement in the environment. So I'm wondering is there any other factors there that we should consider, given that the billings only went up $6 million?\nDavid Obstler: No, we said all along that, billings has to do with when bills went out. The advice is to take the revenues for the quarter and then multiply that by 34% 35% or something. And that's the -- and then times 12 and that's sort of the linearity. And that's what drives the business. What we're doing with billings, despite the fact we don't run is, we're trying to clean away some of the noise of when a bill went out this quarter versus that quarter, which isn't germane main to the top line growth of the business. So I would say, urging everyone back towards the ARR approximation and the top line and we're just basically giving pro formas here, which all are sort of in the 50s percent and RPO, et cetera, which is more in line with revenue growth.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. And then, I'm just wondering if, just -- could you touch on the competitive landscape both for the APM space, as well as log management? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, we'd like to know in the community space. I mean, it's very much a same as it used to be, fortunately or unfortunately, a little bit boring. So any particular question on the computing space?\nAndrew Nowinski: Well, have you seen any sort of win rate improvement now that your cloud usage is certainly getting better? I'm just wondering if your win rates have improved versus competitors like Splunk and Elastic and the log management space, or Dynatrace and New Relic, because they get different pricing changes.\nOlivier Pomel: Most of our business is not replacements, right? Most of our business is net new. So the -- we do see some replacements from time to time, but that's a small minority of the accounts will end. The world is moving to the cloud. Most companies are new to cloud. Most companies are new to this environment and maybe observability and don't have anything yet in that cloud environment, even if they have on-prem and they start using us for that. I don't have a win rate improvement to report, but I'm also not unhappy about win rate. Actually, I don't even look that often at win rates, because that's not what drives most of the acquisition for us.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. One second. My apologies. My one-year old was just barging in. That's what you do -- what you get for working from home. In any case, in closing, I'd like to reiterate that we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. I'm very proud of our execution and I want to thank our employees for the strong productivity that they've shown during the quarter. We recently said that we\u2019d do 10 years anniversary this summer. And I want to say, I'm incredibly proud of the culture we created, incredibly proud of the work, with a calculation of the value we deliver to our customers. But I'm even more excited about our future, the strength of our team and about the magnitude of opportunity. So in other words, the message you should get from this call is that we're just getting started and we're also very excited about it. Thank you all for attending.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thank you, A.J. and thank you all for joining us today. We are very pleased with our performance in Q3 which showed continued high growth at scale and demonstrated efficiencies. It was an exciting quarter in which we maintain our high velocity of product delivery starting with the new products and features announced at DASH, our annual user conference. We are building on our strong track record of innovation and expanding our lead at the most complete and cloud-native end-to-end observability platform. With the majority of our employees continuing to work from home, I am extremely impressed by our productivity. Our engineers continue to build and ship innovative solutions. Our go-to-market teams continue to efficiently deliver value to our customers, and we continue to hire rapidly across R&D and sales and marketing to best position ourselves for the future. We are strategic partners to our customers like never before as the importance of being digital-first and agile is more pronounced than ever. The companies everywhere are continuing to migrate to the cloud, investing in their digital operations to achieve these outcomes. And as our market opportunity driven by multiple platforming and cloud migration has become clearer during this time, so has our ability to execute against it. Now, on to a review of Q3 results. To summarize Q3 at a high level, revenue was $155 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,107 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 727 last year. These customers generated about 75% of our ARR. We have about 13,100 customers, up from about 9,500 last year, which means we added about 1,000 customers in the quarter, meaningfully more than the 600 in Q2. We also continue to be capital-efficient with free cash flow of $29 million. And as in past quarters, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. Now, to review Q3 in more detail. Throughout the quarter, usage growth of existing customers was robust which was a return to more normalized levels after slower usage expansion in Q2. To be more specific, the pace of usage growth in Q3 was broadly in line with pre-COVID historical levels. As a result, we feel comfortable that some of the rationalized cloud usage from our larger customers that we've seen in Q2 was transitory as many of those customers have now returned to steady growth in multiple consecutive markets [ph]. Strength was also broad based across customers of different sizes and within different industries. In addition to that, new logo generation continued to be robust with customer additions in line with pre-COVID levels and churn remained consistent with historical rates. Taking all of this into account, total ARR at the end of the quarter was a new record for the company making this a very successful quarter. Next our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q3, 71% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 50% last year. Approximately 20% of customers are using four or more products which is up from only 7% a year ago. We had another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products, and we continue to be pleased with the uptake of our newest products, including Synthetics, RUM ,NPM, and Security. I will point out that Synthetics has now been commercially available for about a year. And today, it is used by thousands of customers, has reached eight figures of ARR and continues to be in hyper growth. Adoption of Synthetics has exceeded our expectations, which will attribute to the combination of the strength of the product itself and the product platform. As a reminder, frictionless adoption is a key value proposition of our platform, which we expect would benefit all of our products. To conclude my review of the quarter, our ability to both land and expand during what has been a time of uncertainty demonstrates Datadog's importance as companies of all sizes and across all industries even in the most challenged sectors are turning to their digital operations as the most strategically important segment of their business. Now on to R&D. We have a proven and long track record of innovation, and our team lived up to that standard in Q3 with the introduction of eight new products and major features at DASH. Those announcements include introduction of the Datadog Marketplace to enable technology partners to build applications on top of our platform; the general availability of Continuous Profiler to measure cloud-level performance to an always-on and low overhead solution; expanding Synthetics to continuous integration and deployment pipelines, which ended testing earlier in the development process. The introduction of mobile Real User Monitoring for both Android and iOS; the general availability of error tracking to aggregate triage and prioritize front end application errors; the beta launch of incident management for develops and security teams, the beta launch of compliance monitoring, which extends our security solutions to proactively notify on misconfigurations and compliance threat [ph], and lastly the beta launch of recommended monitors, a suite of preconfigured curated and customizable alerts. Additionally, we recently announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft currently in public preview, which will make Datadog available to purchase, implement, and use directly from the Azure console and Azure and Datadog sales teams will increase collaboration for cross-selling to enterprise clients. Today, we also announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with Google Cloud Platform, which extends our GCP presence into new regions and enhances our go-to-market collaboration and sales alignment between Datadog and GCP. We believe this partnership along with our existing alliance with AWS demonstrates our leadership in cloud environments as well as the collaborative nature of our relationship with the public cloud vendors. These are just a few of the new features and enhancements we shipped this quarter. Rather than listing them all, I'll conclude on R&D with two main takeaways. First, I am very proud of the continued productivity of our teams. Together, we have not allowed the pandemic and work-from-home to slow down our roadmap. And we have also been able to successfully hire and onboard at scale throughout the challenging times. Second, we continue to deliver the most complete and cloud-native end-to-end observability platform, and yes we are only getting started. Now, on to the sales and marketing. As you know, this quarter we hosted DASH our annual user conference. While this was our first time hosting it in an whole -virtual format, this enabled us to reach a broader audience of over 7,000 attendees, which was more than 5x last year's count. That was a great success bringing together our customers prospects and partners to show the power of Datadog and many of the new products discussed earlier. And I want to give a special thank you to our events and community teams for excellent execution in a quickly environment. Now let's discuss some of our wins this quarter. First, I'll highlight three notable up sales that demonstrate the broad move to digital channels that has been catalyzed by the pandemic and our ability to rapidly scale with our customers. First the 7-figure upsell with a large Latin America e-commerce company that has been handling record level of orders. This company brought down silos and now has hundreds of users in Datadog collaborating around the share view of the IT stack. Next a European on-demand company that has seen its business more than doubled from last year and has grown standard of usage more than 4 times. The company has standardized monitoring on Datadog with a seven-figure deal, featuring all seven of our platform products, including security to enhance real-time threat detection. And last, a U.S. gaming company that has seen material growth in their platform and now has a seven-figure commitment to Datadog. In addition to using all three of our pillars, they are using Datadog to support their server-less architecture, they harness our machine learning to detect anomalies before they occur and they also report on key business metrics to finance and advertising teams. We also had good success with customers from traditional industries that need to transform. We had a six-figure new logo win from a 150 years old postal service in Europe. This organization aims to deliver more digital services to its customers, while undergoing a transition to a multi-cloud and containerized environment. They are using four products including Synthetics to monitor back to front-end across both on-cloud and on-premise environments. Next, we had a sizable upsell to a European financial service institution. After joining as a customer just over a year ago, this company increased spend more than 4 times for their consolidated monitoring on Datadog to now exceed $1 million in ARR. Finally, we had an upsell with a 100-year-old global shipping company, which we mentioned on last year's call for Q3. Back then, this customer was spending mid-six figures on Datadog infrastructure monitoring. Today this customer's ARR has crossed into seven figures, using infrastructure monitoring, APM, logs, Synthetics RUM, NPM and Security. This is a great example of not only how companies of all stages are undergoing digital transformation, but also of our powerful cross-selling motion as we introduce new products to market. Now moving on to our outlook. As we look ahead to the final quarter of 2020, we continue to be excited about the market opportunity ahead of us and we are confident in our ability to execute, given continued strong performance through challenging times. After some of the rationalized cloud usage which was in Q2, we've seen a clear return to normalized unit growth. It is apparent that cloud migration is not only resilient in the current environment, but may even grow stronger longer term. Companies globally and across all industries are prioritizing digital operations like never before. And the cloud is a clear strategic winner to enable greater agility and innovation. We continue to believe Datadog is a primary beneficiary of this trend and that we remain very well positioned to win in the market. In other words, while the near-term macro environment remains uncertain and could cause bumps along the way, we are very confident in the long-term opportunity and in our positioning. And we believe that we can continue to sustain strong growth, both in the near term and over time. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? And just to complement on that, this is Olivier. If you compare it to last year, so one thing to remember is we have a ratable SaaS model. So the growth we did forego in Q2 is going to be with us in the year-to-year comparison a little bit. Last year at the same time we had an acceleration also, which makes it for a tougher compare. And it's going to \u2013 the increases in ARR only show up in revenue when they're actually incurred in the usage. So it depends on when we added those in the quarter and also put the flexibility of ARR was in Q2. So basically this is how you bridge the record ARR with the revenue as it [indiscernible]. Yes. So, first all, I should say we already have customers non-stop [ph] providers. We've been working with them before. So today our customer distribution follows a little bit the arrival of the cloud providers. So, we still have many more customers and more revenue volume on AWS, for example than we do in Azure. We \u2013 what's interesting with this new partnership is that we get more tightly integrated into the Azure console itself and we're the first vendor to do that. What's interesting there is the user base for Azure tends to be a bit more homogeneous or used to be a bit more homogeneous in the technology they use mostly for Microsoft. And so the ability to be more integrated with Microsoft really can reduce friction and help onboard new customers onto our platform. So we see that as a great opportunity to get more customers and more usage from Azure as Azure itself is growing and as their customers are diversifying their tech stack. I should say that this is only one of the cloud providers we're working with. We have \u2013 we're active on all of the other platforms. We announced another partnership with GCP today. We have another one with AWS. So this is an evolution not a revolution. To your point also, our customers can use their Azure credits and there will be some cross-selling involved with the Microsoft team. So, we're excited about the lift in go-to-market there. One last thing to remember is that this is still in preview. So the -- we don't expect any significant volume fallout in the near term. That's something that's going to kick in over the next few quarters. It's not going to be immediate, all right? So the Azure one is just in preview right now. It's not completely live yet. The GCP partnership involves a number of new technical things that need to happen, but also some new go-to-market motions we're putting in place. So, there's not going to be an immediate impact, but we see that as being potentially meaningful contributed in the mid to long-term. Well, the entry point for most of our customers is usually infrastructure. But the -- as we mentioned earlier in the call, in 75% of the cases, it also comes in with [indiscernible] of our products. So we see that really as a get way into the platform and then a way for us to have customers use all three or four products in the end. Yeah. That's definitely what we see. I mean, we see -- I think, it's very obvious for customers that they need to integrate various parts of observability together and then having all that on top of the same platform is desired outcome. So we see more and more of that, but it's not specific to the enterprise. We see that happening over all segments at this point. Yeah. Look the one thing I should say is anytime you charge customers for millions of dollars, they're going to ask questions about the price. It's the whole department in enterprises that are built just for that. That being said at the end of the day what matters is how much value you deliver for that price. And I think for that we're doing a pretty good job. I think the one thing everybody is grappling with and as more and more applications moving to the cloud and those applications generate more and more data, what's the best way to align how is that is being used for observability reasons, for security reasons other reasons to align that with all the value with the price being paid. And when you look at our product offering and what we've been adding that's why we've added all of these new SKUs to really unbundle what we're doing with the data so customers can really buy to align with the needs they have. For example, we announced more recently treating without limits, which is a way to send extremely large amounts of data to our APM, but only retain the part of it that actually makes sense to customers and they want to retain long-term. We've done the same thing with before. We're doing something with our infrastructure product. These are the way we basically put our customers in control so they can align what they pay with the value they get. Yes. And I'll complement that. Sorry, I'll just complement that on the growth side. I mean right now we're so early in the opportunity that the way we think about the way we grow our team isn't directly related to the way we think about the growth we're going to get next year. We really think of it in terms of how fast we can grow them while optimizing for both short-term and long-term growth. So we are growing the team as fast as we can basically and we think there's enough opportunity to justify it. And that's true both on the R&D side and on the sales and marketing side which we are in and we are very convinced that the opportunity is there. And just to put that into -- to frame that a little bit we're growing a lot faster than the cloud providers as a whole which would mean plenty, plenty of market for us to get. It's very possible. Every company that -- which is a large scale and grows at some point start specializing their sales force. We haven't had to do that at this point. And I would say, we're optimistic that for the observability part of the stack at this point we'd be very successful at having one sales team sell that. I think the issue might come first for the new categories we're entering such as security where the barriers might be a little bit different. There again these products are new enough. And the customer base is for these products and the I would say the customers for which these products are mature not are a small enough group targeting enough group that we don't need to specialize for 30 years that's definitely something that's on our minds for the future. Thank you. So broadly, there's no change. The space is very much the same as it's been for the past few years. We don't see anything different today with customers. We don't see anything different in the adoption cycle. We hear a lot about it so around earnings time. But that's about it. Yeah. This definitely customers expect definitely to get to do more with observability than just infrastructure, I would say. The field is there. It's understanding what it needs better there. At the same time, when we land with customers, the balancing act is between having them use more products on day one, but also slowing down the landing which is why the number has been pretty stable around 75% of the land that, include two or more products. I think that corresponds to the right balance right now between landing fast and landing with more than one product. Again, landing fast is critical. Like it's a very important part of our business and we've been very successful with our infrastructure products in particular. Well, it's a collection of all of these, right? I think, we're still super early in this. At this point, we're working with our very first few partners to make sure that we define \u2013 we develop the platform in a way that serves go to them. And we think, if we make them successful, they'll make us successful in the long run. So as far as monetization comes in, we worry about them more than we worry about us at this point, just to make sure they're successful and they get what they want out of it. So super early, we think it's important. We think it's going to play a dividend in the future but we have many, many, more quarters of innovation to come on these to fully deliver on the business. And just a point on that. We'll see more of that in the future, right? I mean the beauty of our model is because of the efficiency of our go-to-market, we don't actually care if customers pay us upfront; we want to align with them on that. And so we're -- I'm pretty sure we'll see more of that as we grow. Yes. On Security, I think it's too early to have a lot to share there, but the product is growing very nicely. We're getting great adoption stories from customers but it's growing very quickly from a very small number. So -- and it's still very early in its life cycle. So we fleshed out the offering a little bit at DASH with the compliance product. There's a lot more we're working on both of the existing base and on new base for security, so let's say it's still early. And just to restate some of what David said on the growth, we're very happy with the growth we've seen in Q3. It really showed a reversion to normal for the month-to-month growth. I mean if you look at the most growth in ARR any of the month in Q3 like it could have slowed this month in Q3 or Q4 -- sorry in Q4 or Q1 they would have sit right there. So I think it's not that we're very happy with what we've seen. At the same time, we're still very careful about because we don't -- in the macro backdrop, we still question what can happen towards the end of Q4. Into the log monitoring, you said? Yeah. I mean look the log product is in hyper growth right? And it's a very exciting and also a challenging one for customers because it's one of the products, for which is the easiest to generate a lot of fairly useless data and have to pay for it, which is why a lot of the innovations we've made initially on that product were around giving customers more control to align what they pay with the value they get. So we've done quite a bit of that. As we keep growing that product we're getting into situations where customers are not standardizing on us for all of their observability including logs. And we've been basically pulled by our enterprise customers to add a lot of the enterprise features that they would expect from a platform that they and all of their extremely confidential data into. So that's a lot to do what we've been doing more recently. It's interesting because it's -- we've announced many new products and they all got quite a bit of attention. I would say we've got quite a few eyes on the new incident management product which is only in beta. We've got a lot of excitement for the profiler product. So, there's a number of different things that customers are excited about from DASH. I think we still have in all of those cases it's still early for those products. So, we still have to fully bring them to market. For most of them we still have to charge for them. And we have to basically work with our customers to make sure that these products fully deliver on their promise and our vision. But that's the way we build, right? The way we build is we build with our customers. We put the products in their hands. We make sure they see the value. We make sure they have the controls so they can align what they pay with the value they get and then we grow those customers on those products. Today we don't think so. There's no reason to think we're going get this in the model we have so far. We might still see some fluctuation mostly because of the back and forth between building more products and optimizing our use of the infrastructure because they are the same engineers that do both and also because of our expansion to new geographies and new data sets and things like that which might push down a little bit. But there's no reason to believe that we're headed into a completely different ZIP code there at least not today. Yes, today it's a very small part of our business that is partner-sourced. And so all of the partnerships we've discussed are basically all upside for us. And that's why we're investing in all of those. We think there's a number of we can get thanks to these partners. And we're investing in the partner organization in general. We launched our partner program earlier this year. It's starting to see a bit amount of success but it's still a small part of the business. Yes. So we started building a team for that right? And we are as you know we have a number of things in process for FedRAMP and et cetera. We think it's going to be similar in many ways to the way we sell to other customers and different in a few other ways. In terms of the importance of the business, we think it can be a big part of the business. And if you look at other communities in comparable spaces like it is a big part of their business but providers or other vendors in security or observability. So, we believe that there's really a good opportunity there. So, again, this is all upside for us. Well I mean there's nothing exclusive in most of these relationships, right? But in many situations like the way they are implemented and what the [indiscernible] is really different. And they're also different depending on the cloud provider we work with. So for example, the way we integrate \u2013 we're going to integrate with Azure plugs directly to their console which is not the case with some of the other cloud providers. So that's something that's interesting there. Now in terms of what others could or could not do it's hard for me to comment. I mean I believe that it's software so we can do it. Others might be able to do it. I think what we've proven time and time again is that, because of the overall structure of our products, because of the structure of our customer base not go to market, we end up having a product that is a lot easier and has a lot of traction to adopt and ends up being more widely adopted by our customers and more successful in the end. And I think that's what we \u2013 that would guide basically the way we run all those partnerships. So what attracted us to the edge partnership with the ability to reduce friction there. And that's why we decided to invest in that first. We totally absorb all the data. We totally absorb all the data. Absolutely. There's no sampling. Sampling is something customers can choose to do if they don't want to retain everything and store everything. But absolutely, we take all the data. And actually one thing we announced recently with our treating without limit product. It actually allows us to be -- we're the only ones to actually take absolutely 100% of the data sent to our infrastructure and available in the real-time even in extremely high volume environment and then we go to environments where they're keeping track of millions and millions of requests per second. So we do that and it's not something that the other vendors don't do. So we -- there's no sampling required. Sampling it's just the way for customers to decide, hey, the millions and millions of debug logs, my developers are sending, I only need to keep 10% of them to see what's going on as they written that in storage for a longer time and for many checks without having to pay for that. Yeah. So, a couple of ways in the case. So the first one is we actually think it's a because of the model and we are fully SaaS, machine learning is a strength of ours, because we actually see all of the data we can train or algorithms of all of the data. We can seek to choose the problems and the use cases that we want to solve with machine learning, which is the ones that we don't. So it actually strengthens the long-term structural strength for what we do. That being said, we don't like to lead with the promise -- the promise of an AI that teaches everything for you, because we think in general those promises under deliver. They look great in the demo. But then a number of specific states you're going to find them to fall short and that's not what we want. And that's true of pretty much all the products you see there today. So our approach is to basically under-promise and over-deliver and we think we have long-term structural strength in there because of the way run of products and the data line that we see, which is not something that most of us competes can do or have. Now in terms of the adoption, we see -- we've been purposefully selective in the situation in use cases we saw with Datadog today. But we see without being used by our customers in real situations and they rely on it and that's something that we keep building upon. Thank you. Yes, we'd like to know in the community space. I mean, it's very much a same as it used to be, fortunately or unfortunately, a little bit boring. So any particular question on the computing space? Most of our business is not replacements, right? Most of our business is net new. So the -- we do see some replacements from time to time, but that's a small minority of the accounts will end. The world is moving to the cloud. Most companies are new to cloud. Most companies are new to this environment and maybe observability and don't have anything yet in that cloud environment, even if they have on-prem and they start using us for that. I don't have a win rate improvement to report, but I'm also not unhappy about win rate. Actually, I don't even look that often at win rates, because that's not what drives most of the acquisition for us. Thank you. One second. My apologies. My one-year old was just barging in. That's what you do -- what you get for working from home. In any case, in closing, I'd like to reiterate that we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. I'm very proud of our execution and I want to thank our employees for the strong productivity that they've shown during the quarter. We recently said that we'd do 10 years anniversary this summer. And I want to say, I'm incredibly proud of the culture we created, incredibly proud of the work, with a calculation of the value we deliver to our customers. But I'm even more excited about our future, the strength of our team and about the magnitude of opportunity. So in other words, the message you should get from this call is that we're just getting started and we're also very excited about it. Thank you all for attending."

            "name": "David Obstler",
            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we delivered strong third quarter top and bottom line results, amid a difficult macro backdrop. Revenue was $154.7 million, up 61% year-over-year. Usage trends were robust and return to more normalized growth after the pressure that we saw in Q2. Meanwhile, platform traction continued to be strong. New logo generation was robust and churn was in line with historical norms. To provide some more context; first, on usage, usage from existing customers was robust. And our third quarter dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 13th consecutive quarter. After some pressure seen in Q2, driven by optimization efforts from larger customers at scale in the cloud, Q3 was characterized by a decisive return to more normalized growth from our existing customers. Throughout the quarter, we saw usage growth that was more in line with pre-pandemic historical levels. The trend was broad-based and sustained throughout the quarter. This provides us with confidence that what we experienced in Q2 was a transitory optimization effort that were related to the challenging macro environment. While further optimization may happen periodically, as we've talked about previously, we feel confident that cloud migration is very much intact and perhaps even strengthening longer term. Recall that we have a ratable SaaS model. Therefore, while Q3 usage growth was back to pre-COVID levels, the pressure experienced in Q2 can still be seen in our year-over-year comparisons for a number of quarters. Our powerful land and expand model continues to be driven by both usage growth of existing products, as well as the cross-selling to our newer solutions. Next, in the third quarter, we saw continued strength in our platform strategy with over 70% of our customers using two or more products and about 20% of our customers now using four or more products, up from only 7% a year ago. Continued product traction is being driven by adoption in the initial land as well as strong cross-selling. The newest products continue to perform well growing run rate quarter-over-quarter. I note that many of them such as RUM, NPM and Security are still early and therefore small contributions to results in the quarter. Next, new logo results were solid with customer additions in line with pre-COVID levels and strength across sales channels and regions. And lastly churn was stable, in line with historical levels and improved from the slight elevation seen in Q2. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the low to mid-90s. Now turning to billings, which were $155.9 million, up 39% year-over-year against an exceptionally difficult compare. We have said that we will provide a pro forma to more clearly align billings growth with the economics and growth of the business. And in Q3 there were a number of timing and duration differences that affected the growth of billings in the quarter. First, on last year's Q3 call, we had disclosed that there was an invoice timing difference, which increased billings by $6 million. Pro forma excluding that bill billings would have been $106.4 million. Next, in the quarter, we had an $11 million impact to billings and deferred revenue from a few long-term large customers, which moved from annual billings to semiannual or shorter duration upon their renewals. Notably all of these customers continue to commit on an annual basis. They're simply breaking up their bills as we talked about on the last call into smaller increments. If we pro forma for these timing effects, Q3 2020 billings would have been $166.9 million. So now, comparing the pro forma billings of $166.9 million to the year ago apples-to-apples of 106.4%, the growth is 57% relatively in line with revenue growth. Remaining performance obligations or RPO was $316 million, up 50 per year. Current RPO growth was similar to pro forma billings growth. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate as we've just discussed versus revenue based on the timing of invoicing and signing of customer contracts while revenue incorporates customer usage. Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder unless otherwise noted all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials release. Gross profit in the quarter was $121.5 million representing a gross margin of 79%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and 76% in the year ago period. Year-over-year improvement in gross margin was driven by more efficient use of cloud infrastructure. The slight decrease in gross margin sequentially was due to minor inefficiencies created from our investments in products and platform innovation as we have discussed. As a reminder, our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter within an acceptable range as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies. R&D expense in the quarter was $45.8 million or 30% of revenue compared to 28% a year ago. We've continued to invest significantly in R&D including high growth of our engineering headcount. We've been able to attract talent and execute on hiring and onboarding, enabling us to deliver multiple record quarters of engineering headcount additions. We continue to see a meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $49.7 million, or 32% of revenue compared to 39% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but the pace of revenue growth continues to outpace that investment. This was another quarter of no in-person trade shows or marketing events. While we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead-generating activities, it was not on a 1:1 ratio. G&A expense was $12.1 million or 8% of revenue, slightly lower than the 9% in the year ago quarter. And operating income was $13.8 million, or 9% operating margin, compared to operating income of $726,000 or 1% in the year ago period. In addition to the improvement in gross margin, the continued reduction in marketing events, travel, and entertainment and facilities overhead due to COVID contributed to operating margin. Headcount growth was approximately in line with revenue growth in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $16 million, or $0.05 a share on 333 million weighted average diluted shares. We have a very efficient business model, and have experienced a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have delivered five consecutive quarters of breakeven or positive operating income, we note that our priority remains top line growth, and we intend to continue aggressive investments in R&D and go to market. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $36.3 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $28.6 million in the quarter, or a margin of 19%. Cash collections have been very strong amid COVID, a testament to the importance of our solution to our customers. Now, I would like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020. While we saw usage growth in Q3 that was consistent with pre-pandemic historical levels, the pandemic is still ongoing and uncertainty remains. Therefore, we are being prudent by factoring into our guidance, usage growth trends below what we have seen in Q3 and conservative new business assumptions, as well as continued strong investment in R&D and sales and marketing. Beginning with the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $162 million to $164 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 43% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $3 million to $5 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.01 per share positive to $0.02 per share based on an approximately 335 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year 2020 revenue is expected to be in the range of $588 million to $590 million, which represents 62% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $48.5 million to $50.5 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.18 per share based on approximately 332 million weighted average diluted shares. Then some notes below operating income, we expect approximately $1.9 million of quarterly non-GAAP other income, which is net including the interest income on our cash and marketable securities less the interest expense on a convertible debt. And we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer again, but have a tax provision related to our international entity, which we estimate to be approximately $450,000 in Q4. To summarize, we are pleased with the results for the quarter. Usage growth was strong, as companies are prioritizing cloud migration and digital transformation more than ever, and we continue to execute at a high level. We delivered an impressive velocity of product innovation in the quarter, and are investing to continue that track record. While uncertainty related to the macro environment remains, we feel very well positioned to capture what is a large and growing long-term market opportunity. And now with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yes. We had, as we mentioned, organic growth is a very strong contributor and that rebounded particularly in the larger customers to more historical trends. And we continue to have new sales in line. It's a combination of the two that contributed to the record ARR growth. And so, those are the main factors. The organic is always the majority of the growth in a quarter complemented by the new business. Yes. Yes good question. So on revenue, we said that over -- about 60% of our revenue growth comes from existing customers. So we start with the land and expand and look at those cohorts inorganic. And I think we referred to looking at pre-pandemic and historical trends. So that's at the sort of lynchpin making the business relatively predictable even in uncertain times. And then we look at the market size, the opportunity which tends not to be a limit. And so what is, is that the execution, how many salespeople we get in how we can ramp them etcetera. And we then essentially have some experience in understanding ramp and understanding productivity. And those are the algorithms we use in looking at growth. I think we feel and we said this over and over again that there's a very big market and we're very early on. So both in terms of product investment, but also in go to market there's a lot of areas that we are still building out. There are a lot of opportunities. There are a lot of successful territories where we have to put more feet on the street. So we tend to build that from a bottom-up with sales headcount. And that's resulted in sales and capacity as we've talked about in the 60% to 70% growth. And we see that and we see that opportunity and based on our success in bringing people in and getting them productive. As Oli mentioned we have been successful in COVID in hiring and it hasn't really held us back. We've seen a lot of good opportunity and continue to do that throughout the pandemic. Yes. It's the same factor that resulted in the pro forma analysis. There were $11 million of billings from some large customers that had \u2013 would have been 100% in billing, which were chunked up anywhere from semi-annual to monthly billing. So the way to look at that, and do the apples-to-apples would be at that same $11 million, which reflects the economics, and you'll see the deferred revenue in the mid-50s like the other metrics that we talked about. Exactly. It's \u2013 its deals that renewed annually and grew and as we said last time that we're trying to work with our clients, keep the commitment. These are some very long term large customers, who are staying with us, but to accommodate them in this environment in their request to chunk up build that's what it is. Thank you. Yeah. Let me just go over some of the metrics around organic growth and then Oli to Security. So what we said in Q2 was that we had some of the larger customers rationalize. So, therefore, the slowdown of organic was concentrated first in the larger customers and that about 10% of our customer base and ARR was in impacted industries where there was some pressure. And what we saw in Q3 was sort of return to normalcy in those, meaning the larger customers continue to now after that optimization grow in pre-pandemic rates. And we also saw that the COVID impacted -- the impact was taken the medicine was taken and they also continue to be stable to slightly up. So essentially it was across enterprise mid-market and SMB. And it was across also the large customer the small customer that exhibited similar types of organic growth, which is what we've seen over the long period in the company but saw a different effect in Q2. Oli on Security? Yes. No they've been customers that have grown substantially. One of them is a customer that's more than doubled over the last year or so. So this is merely that we have changed the billing terms but they are all customers that have been growing with us over the last few years. Yes. I think just overall we've tended to be conservative in our guidance to incorporate usage growth rates that are lower than what we have seen and new logo accumulation that's lower. And I think we said last time, that given that velocity and the fact that we're in the pandemic and we can't predict what might happen around the world, we wanted to continue to roll that conservatism forward. So it's really that at the core of the guidance rather than anything that in particular that we've seen that's different than what we said on the call today. Yes. No, we said all along that, billings has to do with when bills went out. The advice is to take the revenues for the quarter and then multiply that by 34% 35% or something. And that's the -- and then times 12 and that's sort of the linearity. And that's what drives the business. What we're doing with billings, despite the fact we don't run is, we're trying to clean away some of the noise of when a bill went out this quarter versus that quarter, which isn't germane main to the top line growth of the business. So I would say, urging everyone back towards the ARR approximation and the top line and we're just basically giving pro formas here, which all are sort of in the 50s percent and RPO, et cetera, which is more in line with revenue growth."

Before discussing the results of the quarter, I want to proudly report that together with our employees, we raised over $1 million for charities supporting COVID release, as well as organizations working to dismantle the systemic discrimination experienced by black communities. We are living in unprecedented times for many reasons, and we want to do our part to help. And as always, Datadog is committed to supporting diversity and inclusion within our company and communities. Now turning to Q2 results, we are happy to report another quarter of strong growth and demonstrated financial efficiencies. Execution was strong during challenging times, including robust new logo generation and continued platform adoption. While we are pleased with our execution in the quarter, we did experience some impact to the rate of usage growth of our customers related to the micro environment. While this macro uncertainty remains in the near-term, we continue to believe that this environment accentuate the need to be digital first and agile and confirms the cloud as the best path to achieve these outcomes over the long-term. And we see evidence of this in growing overall demand in the form of new customers and new use cases for existing customers. To summarize, Q2 at a high level, revenue was $140 million, an increase of 68% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,015 customer with ARR of $100,000 or more, which is an increase of 71% from last year. These customers generate about 75% of our ARR. We have about 12,100 customers, which represent growth of 37% from about 8,800 last year. We also continued to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $19 million. And as in past quarters, our dollar based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted on newer products. So we are continuing to deliver high growth at scale. Now looking at Q2 in more detail. New logo generation was robust in the quarter as new logo ARR grew both from last quarter and year-over-year and gross new customers additions matched to the record set in Q1. We saw companies of all sizes and geographies prioritize cloud migration and digital transformation. For instance in the quarter, we had a few small yet notable new logo wins from two global auto chains, an amusement park chain, a large US university and a European airline. These wins showed that even in the face of challenging times for these customers, transforming to ensure business resilience and longevity is a top priority. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q2, 68% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 40% a year ago, we had another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products and I would add that over 15% of our customers are now using four or more products, while we had zero last year. We are also very pleased with the uptake of our newest products in a short period of time, with Synthetics, RUM, NPM and Security all released over the last year. We are winning in the market, because we are cloud native, our support of cloud and other ephemeral architectures is more important than ever as a rapid change from work from home has demonstrated the limitation of legacy infrastructure. And we believe recent events will accelerate the migration to the cloud as the economy improves. We win because we offer the broader solution with end-to-end visibility from backend infrastructure, all the way through to the end user experience and now security as well. And we win because we offer a truly integrated platform, voicing OpenView into the IT stack. Now, as we mentioned earlier, while execution was strong, the macro environment did have some impact on our top line results, and in particular on growth of existing customers. Our customers continue to grow usage of our platform in Q2, but the rate of this growth was below the trends we saw before the pandemic. This dynamic was primarily seen in our larger customers, who already had sizable cloud environment. Given macro uncertainty, we saw these customers look to conserve cash where they still could and therefore, optimize the consumption of cloud infrastructure. On the flip side, smaller customers and large enterprises that are earlier in their cloud journey continue to see stronger growth. To put it plainly, customers with large cloud deals from AWS, Azure or GCP look for short-term savings. Note that this is not a new motion, as we see many enterprises go through these optimization exercises on a regular basis. What was unusual this quarter was to see a large number of companies going through it at the same time. I would also note that while these customers are the greatest scale in the cloud, they mostly remain at a low penetration relative to their overall IT environment. Therefore, these customers continue to have a long runway of growth in their cloud adoption over time. Lastly, while we do not want to get into the habit of providing intra-quarter update, I'd like to provide some commentary on what we saw in July. Given the unique macro seconds ended. We saw over the last month, a notable improvement in usage growth relative to Q2, driven by broad-based strength across our customer base. It is however too soon to know, if this growth will sustain given the macro environment. As a result and while we are encouraged by these trends, we remain prudently conservative in our outlook for the remainder of the year, which David will speak to. As a reminder, we have both a subscription and usage based revenue model and the growth of our revenue is relative to the growth of our customer's cloud footprint and data volume. Finally, to bookend this topic, I'm very proud of the performance of our go-to-market teams during the challenging times. As we are executing well against what we can control and our teams are delivering record levels of new logos and product cross-sell. Next on to R&D, we continue to make significant investments to rapidly deliver innovation. We have a proven track record of success introducing new products and we see many new opportunities to expand our portfolio. For example, we recently announced the general availability of private locations for Synthetics, which enables dev and ops teams to proactively test internal applications that are not accessible from the public Internet. We also acquired Undefined Lab, a provider of observability for dev and test workflows. This will enable Datadog to be injected earlier in the software lifecycle starting before code is even committed to a central repository. And this will equip customers with better tracking of continuous integration and deployment workflows and enable them to identify issues before reaching production. Other continued product innovations include the general availability of the Datadog mobile app to provide engineers with access to the alerts and dashboards on the go, support for Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to enable streaming logs directly from AWS services to Datadog; and the preview release of the Datadog IoT agent to provide visibility into Internet of Things devices. We have also added and improved a number of integrations including AWS 1-click deploy, HiveMQ, Apache Ignite and Hazelcast. As we keep investing in R&D, we plan for continued rapid pace of innovation and we'll be showcasing some of our newer products at our Annual User Conference, Dash, which is held online next week on August 11. Switching gears a bit, we recently achieved FedRAMP authorization for low-impact SaaS, and Datadog is now fully available in the FedRAMP marketplace. We continue to build out our public sector go to market motion and while it is likely to take some time. We are excited about this long-term opportunity. Now let's talk briefly about several wins in the quarter. First, we had a seven-figure of sale with a large FinTech company. With Datadog, this customer has been able to move from multiple disparate monitoring tools using a single platform for all three pillars of observability. This allowed them to refocus engineering teams on building new features and they expect more than $1 million in savings from consolidating disparate monitoring logging vendors into Datadog. Another seven figure expansion came from a European automotive company, which is modernizing and adopting Microsoft Azure. Through adoption of Datadog Infrastructure Monitoring APM and NPM, their teams are now collaborating on a share platform and are moving to an increasingly agile development model. Next, we saw a large entertainment platform that had been using more and more of our products, commit to over $10 million in ARR. This company has made a decision to increase investment in observability and their use of Datadog both with new products and by scaling up on existing products. And we also mentioned a high six figure land deal with a leading asset manager, which is now using us for infrastructure monitoring APM and logs as well as Synthetics and early adoption of security. And last, we had a six figure upsell to a seven figure ARR with a social networking platform that has seen tremendous growth during the pandemic. At record levels of scale, they can use Datadog to quickly drill down into any sale request and easily identify layers, this company is now using all three pillars, including Synthetics, RUM and NPM, and has standardized monitoring on Datadog. Now, moving on to our outlook. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we remain very excited about our market opportunity. Recent events have made one thing very clear, it is more important than ever to be a digital first business and the cloud is the best path to achieve this outcome. We continue to believe Datadog is the primary beneficiary of these trends and remains very well positioned to win in the market. In the near-term, the macro environment is likely to continue to cause uncertainty, but our focus remains on executing on executing against our strategic priorities, which have not changed. First, we are building on our strong track record of innovation by introducing new products, entering new categories and continuing to improve existing solutions. Second, we continue to hire rapidly in R&D and are pursuing talent that would not otherwise get in the market. And third, we are aggressively expanding our go-to-market globally and into newer channel. We are very confident that we continue to sustain strong growth both in the near-term and over time. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we delivered strong second quarter top and bottom line results amid a difficult macro backdrop. Revenue was $140 million, up 68% year-over-year, against the challenging compare. Execution was strong with robust new logo generation and continued platform traction. While the macro environments did pressure usage of existing customers. To provide some more context. First, in Q2 we strong -- we saw strong new logo additions with robust contributions from both enterprise and commercial sales channels and sequential growth of new logo ARR. Execution against our platform has been very strong with 68% of customers now using two or more products versus just 40% a year ago driven by both lands and cross-selling. In the second quarter, our dollar based net retention was once again above 130% for the 12th consecutive quarter. We saw continued growth of our existing customers, driven by both increased usage of existing solutions and robust cross-selling to newer solutions. Our net retention rate, which remains best-in-class above 130% did however decline from Q1. As Olivier discussed, macro factors pressured usage increases. To add some detail. First, while existing customers did grow, the rate of growth was below pre-pandemic levels. This was primarily seen from our larger customers with a greater scale in the cloud, who experienced business pressures and softer save in the near-term by slowing down their consumption. Additionally, one dynamic, which we discussed as a possibility on our Q1 call is that we did see the normalization of some spike usage from Q1. In March, we had a number of customers such as streaming media vendors, scale rapidly in the face of COVID. Over the following months, some of these customers were able to optimize usage and save on cloud spending amid budget pressures and normalization of business activities. Next, some customers such as delivery and media companies, have continued to see elevated demand and therefore have continued to meaningfully grow their Datadog usage. Lastly, we saw some of our COVID impacted customers reduce usage. As a reminder, these customers such as those in hospitality and travel contribute less than 10% of our ARR and therefore, they were a mild track detractor. Lastly, churn was a bit elevated related to the most hard hit COVID customers, but better-than-expected. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the low to mid-90s. Performance of our SMB customer base has been robust including stable dollar based churn and continued rapid growth year-over-year. Now turning to billings, which was $160.1 million and up 62% year-over-year relatively in line with revenue growth. Entering the quarter. As we discussed on the last call, we thought it was possible some customers would seek to renegotiate terms or slow payments but that did not happen in a material way, pointing to the importance of our solution. Remaining performance obligations or RPO was $287 million, up 53% year-over-year. We did not see a material change in billings durations in Q2. We did see some slight shortening of contract duration year-over-year related to large multiyear contracts closed in the year ago quarter. We continue to have great success in closing annual committed deals, which remains our strategic focus. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate versus revenues based on the timing of invoicing and signing of customer contracts while revenue incorporates customer usage. Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $111.8 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% also last quarter and 75% in the year ago period. Year-over-year improvement of gross margin was driven by efficient use in our cloud hosting. Our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter with an acceptable ranges, as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies. R&D expense was $38.3 million or 27% of revenue, compared to 30% in the year ago quarter. We have continued to invest significantly in R&D as Olivier mentioned, including high growth of our engineering headcount. However, the growth of revenue continues to outpace even our substantial investments and we did have some leverage from T&E and overhead savings related to work from home. We continue to see a meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D going forward. Sales and marketing expenses were $45.7 million or 33% of revenue, compared to 42% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments, but the pace of revenue growth has outpaced that investment. This was the first full quarter of no in-person trade shows for marketing events. While we have successfully redeployed much of the event's budget to advertising and other lead generating activities. It is not so on a one-for-one ratio. G&A expense was $12.5 million or 9% in revenue, in line with the same ratio a year ago quarter. Operating income was $15.3 million or an 11% operating margin, compared to a loss of $5 million and a negative 7% margin in the year ago period. Beyond the improvement in gross margin and revenues outpacing investments, the reduction in travel and entertainment and facilities overhead contributed to the operating margin. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $17.5 million or $0.05 per share based on 331 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Note that our non-GAAP net income, does not include the $5.6 million non-cash benefit related to payroll taxes. We have a very efficient business model and experience a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have delivered four consecutive quarters of breakeven to positive operating income, we note that our priority remains top line growth, and we intend to continue investments aggressively in R&D and go to market. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, which includes the $641 million of proceeds from our convertible note issuance during the quarter, net of issuance costs and the cap call transaction. Cash flow from operations was $24.7 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $18.6 million in the quarter for a margin of 13%. Free cash flow includes an approximately $4.4 million outflow related to the conclusion of our first employee stock purchase program. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full-year 2020. We are pleased with our execution and ability to drive new sales in an uncertain macro environment. As discussed, we did see some lower growth in usage from our existing customers in Q2, due to the overall slowing of the economy. As Olivier noted, however, in July, we experienced an improvement in usage trends relative to Q2 that were closer to our pre-pandemic historical levels. However, it is too soon to know if this will prove to be sustainable and given the lack of clarity of economic trends, we are assuming usage growth of existing customers below pre-COVID growth rates. Additionally, while we have not yet seen a material impact to our new sales, we think it is prudent to expect some impact in the second half given that the macro backdrop. Beginning with the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $143 million to $145 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 50% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of a loss of $1 million to an income of $1 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be breakeven to $0.01 per share based on approximately 333 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now for the full-year 2020, revenue is expected to be in the range of $566 million to $572 million, which represents a 57% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $28 million to $34 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share based on approximately 332 million of fully -- weighted average fully diluted shares. A few things to take into account in our guidance. First, when evaluating our quarterly growth rates, it is important to consider the accelerated growth rates in the second half of 2019 creating more challenging comps. Next, while we see continued improvement in our gross margins, we are running towards the top end of our long-term target. As we prioritize product development and diversifying our cloud hosting vendors and regions, our gross margins may fluctuate within a range of acceptability. Next, as I mentioned earlier, our intention continues to be to invest meaningfully, including aggressive hiring in R&D and sales and marketing and we have not changed our plans during COVID. Then some notes below operating income. We expect approximately $2.4 million of quarterly non-GAAP other income, which is net including interest income in our cash and marketable securities, less the interest expenses of our convertible debt. Next, we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer, but have a tax provision related to our international entities, we expect a tax provision of approximately $350,000 per quarter. Note, that our share count forecast for Q3 and the full-year are diluted given that we expect to be non-GAAP net income breakeven profitable for both periods. To summarize, we are pleased with our execution during a very challenging time. While the macro environment has impacted our topline results in the near-term, we believe the current environment will prove to be a catalyst for digital transformation and cloud migration over the long-term. And we are very well positioned to be a primary beneficiary of those trends. We have a highly efficient business model and are making investments across the organization today in order to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Hi and thank you for taking the question. And I really appreciate all of the detail that you guys provided in a rough environment and usage, that's very helpful context. So I guess, maybe to start with, Oli, you sort of singled out the sort of primary factor and correct me if I'm wrong, but the primary factor being large customers that have large scale cloud deployments. And would sort of just makes sense, right? It's sort of a large, large numbers impact there as well. What gives you kind of confidence Oli that you think this is a temporary pause with those customers versus something more sustained? Is there any sort of customer conversations you're having -- or was it just kind of like the secular tailwinds of digital transformation. I just want to get a sense of what gives you guys the confidence that in these large customer cohorts that it's more of a digestion period after a period of strong growth versus more -- a more sustained downturn?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So the first thing I'd say is, it's something we've seen before, it happens from time to time like companies ramp up their cloud consumption at some point, their bills going up and they ask themselves can we optimize. And look we've done that too as a company. If you've seen our gross margins. For example, go up from last year that was fairly similar in that respect. What happened there is that everybody has the same idea at the same time like everybody ask themselves, how can we save some cash. The word came pretty much every single company effected down by COVID, because of the uncertainties, cash have to be conserved. One of the good things about cloud is that a lot of it is opex and a lot of it is -- still had to be paid -- has to be paid in the next bill, it's not some costs, so there are still savings to be made. If you take action, so that's what we saw happen. In terms of it, continuing on that, again it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the near-term, but in the broader scheme of thing, companies are still moving to the cloud, but new companies are moving to the cloud that were not before and we've mentioned that on the call. That we've had a number of asset -- key companies that started using us right now, when you think of hotel chains and amusement parks and things like that. We see though -- in the July data and even some of the June data that companies that have optimized their cloud infrastructure. And by the way, in general what we mean by that is not that call Datadog to cut their bill to cut data bill, is that they're trying to figure out what they could shutdown or optimize on the Amazon side, or on the Google side on the Azure side. And so while we see some decrease of their data volume or infrastructure side view over -- period of a few weeks, but then what we see after that is that they start going again, because then their team keeps building and they keep deploying, keeps having customer etc, etc. So it's not an exercise that is new or unexpected. I think what's different now is that, it's a -- it makes sense for all of these companies to be at the same time and it just happened.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. That makes total sense. And then David, if I think about the guidance, right? 68% growth this quarter, and I look at Q3, the high-end is roughly around 50% and the Q4 is roughly around 40%, at least by my math. I think what would be helpful to understand the underlying assumptions behind that guidance? And particularly around those usage trends, right? So, I know there was a -- prior to COVID, there was a significant amount of customers that were sort of overspending relative to their committed usage. If you could sort of give us like the pre-level of usage, anyway to sort of quantify that -- although it looks like post-COVID, to understand the underlying assumptions behind your guidance. Because I think what your guidance assumes is that some of the weaker usage trends persist for the second half? And so anyway to frame that out I think would be very helpful in terms of understanding that, the guidance.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, I think that's right. We have our guidance throughout our history as a public company been fairly prudent and our forward-looking usage and implicit net retention and we're particularly cognizant of that given COVID, most of our guidance has conservative assumptions in that and we continue to do that. I think as we said, we had strong cross sell. And so we see a continued adoption of the platform, which is a good sign and as far as the usage. The more variable usage we saw as Oli just mentioned some constraints. So we tried to use conservative assumptions going forward in our guidance.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. I'll leave the floor. Thank you very much.\nDavid Obstler: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Merwin: Okay, thanks very much for taking my questions. For Olivier, I wanted to ask about your thoughts on pricing, particularly in light of -- or the convergence that we're seeing going on within the observability space. I remember with your log product when you launched it, you had a pretty disruptive pricing strategy where you were charging at very low price for ingestion and you're letting the customers pay just for the logs that they actually want to index. And now we're seeing other players in the space give away entire aspects of their platform for free and creating free tier. So I guess the question is how do you see your pricing model evolving if at all in time and as you keep up the industry leading pace of innovation. Do you see the ability to even raise price as you deliver more value to your customers? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So I think we are -- so we are very careful about pricing, in that the way we do it is, first of all, we encourage having the maximum deployments with our customers, meaning that's why we don't charge by the user, we want absolutely everybody to use it. And then we want to make sure that customers have the levers to align pricing to able to pay to Datadog with value they get. And in our case, that means, having differentiated pricing for very different parts of our platform, because not every single gigabytes of data that is being sent to us has the same value to the customer and represents the same amount of processing and other things online. So we try to align that. Right now, we're happy with our pricing model. It works well in the market. It gives customers the flexibility, but look we've had our pricing model evolve over time, it will probably still evolve in the future. We believe in our ability to winning the market -- at least winning the market and give a more and more value you have pricing power in the long-term and that's where we are today, we want to be in the future. I think when you -- when your only tool is to play on pricing, like it's usually bad news. It means you can't actually win based on the quality of your products alone.\nChris Merwin: Understood. Thank you. And maybe just follow-up for David, would you be able to share some more detail about some of the trends that you saw by customer segment during the quarter, as it relates to net expansion or good churn or any metrics you could share, I guess across SMB and mid-market and our enterprise customers. Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, that was one of the surprises we had very stable gross churn, dollar based gross churn and it's very similar to what we have discussed in the last call that all over the metrics and growths are in the 90s with enterprise tending to be towards the upper part of that range and SMB towards the lower, but all of them strong and in the 90s. We really didn't see very much disruption from that. And similarly, we saw net retention rates come down, we said a little more at the larger end because of this concentration on costs. But all within the same type of bands, we've had since we've become a public company.\nChris Merwin: Great, thanks very much.\nDavid Obstler: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi guys. So in terms of the macro impacts and the slowing of usage of existing customers. Is there any evidence that you've seen of some of those customers slowing the usage of your tools, but supplementing it with maybe the cloud platform tools or something else or they're just slowing the usage and that's it?\nOlivier Pomel: No, I think what we've seen mostly is they're slowing the usage of the cloud infrastructure that's directly related to how we recognize new revenue. So that's what we thought. To put in another terms, they use less Amazon instances or containers or less Azure instances and containers. And that's -- that would end up move the needle for us. And I should say, this is something that we used to see it in the other way, we used to see, like the way we sell it, we send to customers and they're still early in their cloud transition and we grow with them as they grow. What happened this quarter is that their growth slowed overall during the quarter, they still grew and they are still going to grow and what we said in the call is -- in July, so towards the June, we saw some acceleration of the growth again, but we want to remain prudent considering all the uncertainties there is right now in terms of, how long the COVID crisis is going to last and what's going to be the impact in various parts of the economy. We remain prudent in what we think is going to happen in the near-term.\nSterling Auty: Understood. And then one follow-up, how would you characterize the ramping of the new sales resources that you've hired over the last couple of quarters of ramping at the same pace that you've traditionally seen, are they ramping faster, slower?\nOlivier Pomel: We haven't seen any changes there. And everything that that is within control of the sales team actually worked pretty well. We mentioned during the call but -- so we had a record level of new logos, both in terms of numbers and in terms of revenue. We had a record level of new product attach. And this is where our sales team spend their time on. The growth of customers once they are set up every single month, it did only partially related to the world of [indiscernible] like we don't have full control over that, which is also why when we set expectations around our net retention initially, we said we're going to sell at 130%, because we don't fully control that number. A great part of this is driven by the rate of migration to the cloud and the rate at which customers are scaling to the cloud. Again, we're very early in that transition and customers are going to keep transitioning for much longer time, they keep scaling and we see that they only wanted to do that more now they see the impact of COVID on their business and the need to transform. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis. In the near-term, we don't exactly know where that's going.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Mr. Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nRay McDonoug: Hi. Sorry about that. This is Ray McDonough on for Brad Zelnick. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask -- can you help us understand a little bit more the relative size or recent attach rates of your APM and log management solution, both of which I think you mentioned last quarter were growing faster than the overall business. So that remain the case in this recent quarter?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So they are both in hyper growth. So the picture hasn't changed a lot since the last time we talked. The infrastructure iPhone would still be a great public company, logs and APM are still in hyper growth not growing much faster than Datadog grows at this scale and the other products that are smaller and earlier are also growing extremely fast right now. So we -- overall we're fairly happy with those.\nDavid Obstler: And the attach rates and their contribution to net retention, has been very similar to the trends that we've talked about last time. So we continue to have increasing number of customers using the platform and there -- what they're spending on the additional components of the platform continues to grow in hyper growth.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, which is important to understand. The signs of active demand are really strong, whether it's new logo, new products that we -- that rate is actually up from what they've been before and we keep -- this keeps growing over time. So all that is great. The one thing that's been a detractor this quarter has been I would say the passive consumption. I don't like the word passive, because it sounds like we're not doing anything, and customer is not doing anything, but it's something that not directly related to an actual customer they are taking with us today.\nRay McDonoug: Thanks, that's helpful color. And then if I could building on Chris's question from earlier and appreciating that the majority of your lands are Greenfield. How do you think your -- one of your competitor's recent pricing changes and packaging changes will impact your ability to cross sell APM into your customer base? And overall, what do you think that the medium or long-term implications are for your business as you know this one competitor in particular seems to be focused on competing more aggressively on price and total cost of ownership at this point?Yes, so for this kind of changes like we -- we always have to keep an open mind, while we see, what can work and not work. At the same time, look we don't see that having a major impact on us, because we don't actually, our business as you said is mostly Greenfield and you saw today on the strength of our individual product that get tied together in a platform, and there is no problem with our customers adopting our products, little by little. Like they can adapt as little as they want as APM, as little as they want as log and that of their infrastructure, or as little as they want Synthetics, that's not an issue, that's already something we have. We actually give them differentiated pricing that tells that is more tailored to the value they agreed to get for each of those product. So I don't see anything very disruptive there or anything very different. So again from our end, there is no, it won't be a change there.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so for this kind of changes like we -- we always have to keep an open mind, while we see, what can work and not work. At the same time, look we don't see that having a major impact on us, because we don't actually, our business as you said is mostly Greenfield and you saw today on the strength of our individual product that get tied together in a platform, and there is no problem with our customers adopting our products, little by little. Like they can adapt as little as they want as APM, as little as they want as log and that of their infrastructure, or as little as they want Synthetics, that's not an issue, that's already something we have. We actually give them differentiated pricing that tells that is more tailored to the value they agreed to get for each of those product. So I don't see anything very disruptive there or anything very different. So again from our end, there is no, it won't be a change there.\nRay McDonoug: All right. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thank you. Quick question from me. So you mentioned about like this slowing usage in the public cloud. I mean, like the one benefit we have is that we see Azure and Amazon and AWS then report numbers before you. And so in the way, you were always seen as a little bit of a derivative of those and if I look at AWS growth slow down, Azure slow down. I am just wondering, like they almost -- you almost seem more directly in terms of their growth numbers. But in terms of directionally related. Is that something that you're paying attention to as well, because it seems like there seems to be a correlation here?\nOlivier Pomel: Well there is definitely a correlation, and we don't call it exactly with them, right, because they have different product portfolios and some of these tied to what we do today, the kind of the products that we already have for our customers to consume. But the -- what I will say is we understand the dynamics of what happened to these top providers. We saw it happened to these -- to their customers basically, which is they try to save for the next deal, because every million dollar counts in big companies right now. And before they know where their prices is going, they want to make sure they do everything they can. So we have -- we have quality today. And the one thing I will say is, we are growing a lot faster than the cloud providers, because we keep adding more products and we're still underpenetrated in the market. So we are growing a lot faster than they are. And we are still growing faster even in more recent quarters.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes, exactly, no. No. Exactly yes, and that's, true. The -- and then the other question I had is on that subject. But in theory the one offsets you have is like one is consumption usage and there's not that much you can do about it. On the other hand, you mentioned some stats around product uptake etc. Have you taken any action, you kind of change or the incentivized sales force or a push more towards more up selling and cross-selling of other products. Or is this something look we are writing it up, because like COVID is there for everyone, you saw some better trends in July or you taking extra action here?\nOlivier Pomel: No, we didn't change anything. The sales incentives are the same. The way we sell, we have the teams to do is the same. So we haven't changed anything to the -- the way we proceed. The -- we're doing right now is working, right. What we said earlier is, we did bring the right numbers of new logos, the right numbers of product cross-sell that was our focus before, that's still our focus today. The rest, the growth in usage will come because the transition into digital businesses move to the cloud is not going to stop.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes, it makes sense. Perfect, thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Bergstrom: It's Dan Bergstrom for Hedberg. Thanks for taking our question. Wondering about linearity in the quarter, given call-outs around the macro and then large enterprise, you provided some color in July. That was helpful, but anything else from a linearity perspective in the quarter to note or maybe different than what you expected?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So this quarter was actually. I mean, David, I hope you don't -- let's say, if I take a numbers question. But...\nDavid Obstler: No. Go ahead.\nOlivier Pomel: The way the scope that this quarter was a little bit different in that what we saw from early July was fairly consistent with what we had before in Q1. So we saw good growth and great behavior on the logos, which is what we discussed in last call. Sorry, I mentioned, not July -- April. The first few weeks of April were very good growth and new logos. Our new logos remain for the rest of the quarter. But what we saw is towards the end of April and then the full month of May, we had much lower growth. And then things recovered -- had started recovering in June, so growth was going up in June, and is recovering further in July. So these are the trends we've seen. Now, so this is what we saw past quarter, it was a lot noisier than what we used to. Like we're used to having very consistent numbers month over month. We can't really tell whether in the near-term, we will see some return to the previous normal or if we'll still see some oscillation as the state of the economy and other things provoke the same emotions in our customers.\nDan Bergstrom: Great thanks helpful. And then Security Monitoring that's been generally available here for a little over three months. Just curious of initial reception from customers and security engineers. I know, it's a strong demand in beta. And then maybe where should we think about you heading with security? Certainly, a long runway left there?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So we -- now if look, it's still super early right, it's a very, very early product, it has some very focused use cases to start with for some very focused types of customers. We're very happy with the uptake that we did get a good start in terms of customers planning to use it and pay for it. But again, super, super early. So I think maybe we'll talk about it some more in the future when it becomes more material and we have -- when we have more products to talk about there, but we are -- we say we're excited, but still early, still a lot of work to do.\nDan Bergstrom: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Rebeck from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBrad Rebeck: David, I know you don't guide to billings. But I believe looking through my notes next quarter, you had some difficult comps with pretty significant contracts that paid up last 3Q, any color on that would be super helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: We didn't have that and what we -- we didn't present the pro forma, because it wasn't as impactful. We did say in RPOs we had the multi-year contracts, and a quarter ago, which were more concentrated than we had in creating RPO, but it didn't affect the billings numbers that much. And so there was nothing to point out.\nBrad Rebeck: Okay, and no issue for 3Q, as we look forward?\nDavid Obstler: Sorry, I can't hear you. No issues with?\nBrad Rebeck: Sorry, any issues for 3Q with difficult comps from the year before?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, we haven't -- nothing that we are pointing out on this call. So we -- nothing that we wanted to point out.\nBrad Rebeck: Okay, thanks very much.\nDavid Obstler: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham. Your line is now open.\nJack Andrews: Well good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-up on the go-to-market strategy, you talked about -- you haven't really changed anything, but I'm just wondering, as you continue to innovate rapidly and roll out these new products. Are you running into new buyers or new personas within organizations. And how do we think about the implications of that whether you might need to either make more investments or maybe change your strategy over time?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. You're thoroughly right. I think on the -- for the bulk of our product portfolio. We still talk to buyers that are going to be the same or working the same way, for everything that relates to observability I will say. When it comes to security, in some cases, now we are starting to see some different buyers. So today, we are still selling the same way. I mean, the security product is focused enough in terms of the customers we're going after that it works that way, but it's something that we're monitoring, it's possible that we'll make changes in the future to that motion. Nothing yet, we'll get more data, we'll get more and we'll see more how the product behave and how the customers behave as we keep expanding the target audience for that product. But that's something that we're aware of, and we're monitoring.\nJack Andrews: Okay, great. Just as a follow-up, could you elaborate on how you're thinking about the opportunity for the private locations for Synthetic Monitoring product. I mean is this essentially a new way to leverage your technology for employee use? Or how do you think about the opportunity around that?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, I think it's more for all of the internal services that are being exposed. In fact, companies that don't have a web safety UI. One of the -- in fact as many great advantage is but for me it's more difficult to go and reaching to test some endpoints that are not exposed to the Internet. So that solves that. So it allows customers to put probably inside their own networks to automatically test and verify their APIs and their web application, but it also allows them to install probs in a networks they might manage or their -- or that their employees might be using for example, they might deploy that at either a cable providers or basically cloud providers things that we -- we're not hosted in as Datadog, but they want to monitor it directly. So it opens a whole range of possibilities for them.\nJack Andrews: Great. Well, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Bhavan Suri. You announced the launch of your formal Partner Network in January, which expands support for partners via things like go to market collateral, self-training for implementation, opportunity registration, partner locator listing. Can you talk about early interest across partner categories in your near and medium term channel strategy. And how important of a growth lever, do you see this channel being over time? And at least qualitatively, can you talk about how it's been impacted by the macro environment. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks. So, yes, so we've -- since it's a fairly recent program for us. We've had great uptake like we signed up for large number of partners, actually larger than we thought we would. I don't think we've communicated that number publicly. So I will not do it today. But it's been off to a strong start. I think we're working on making sure we have the right process in place, so we can enable those partners and develop them, so not enough to just be a partner, but there are different levels of partnerships, that are also going to have different expectations in terms of what they provide to us, we will provide to them. And so we're working on promoting for partners to -- for different levels right now. So far we've seen some interesting outputs on that. So we've closed deals, large deals, much earlier than we thought through partners. And we've done that in multiple regions. We haven't seen a specific impact on COVID just because that partner network is still new, that it's growing very fast, no matter what. And we can focus on the partners that want to grow now and that have opportunities now as opposed to maintaining the large base of existing partners. So far with the early plus signs, but a lot more to do.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's very helpful. Thank you. And can you talk a little bit more on your international performance this quarter. Are there any specific regions where you're seeing particular strength. And additionally, could you talk about your plans for international investment this year and where you maybe see the most opportunity? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: David, do you want to take this one?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. We are continuing as we've talked about before, to build out regions either when we get to critical mass and have a successful sales team or when we're landing in new territories, so we're continuing the same plan we had which is to build out Asia complete, the build out of EMEA, as well as to expand in some areas like Latin America. We saw good performance as we've talked about before in the second quarter in EMEA on the back of the build outs we had done, and as we said all along, we're earlier in Asia, building out teams and filling out teams for the first time. So we'll continue that as part of our plan in the remainder of the year.\nOlivier Pomel: One thing that's interesting is that the pandemic is hitting different parts of the world at different times. So we have these -- very possible to get turned out and turned off at different times and we've seen that through Q2 basically. Again, it's hard to tell what's going to happen in Q3 with respect to that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, that's great, thanks for the call.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nParthiv Varadarajan: Thanks. This is Parthiv on for Brent. Hey, Oliver, I wanted to ask about the Undefined acquisition, can you help us frame the opportunity for observability in the application testing spaces. I guess, how should we think about the usage patterns in development environments relative to production environments?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so what's very interesting with Undefined is that they focus completely on what happens when developers check their own codes first on their own machine and then to share Naxi ITD process until it ends up being deployed in production. So it's not an area where we've been present before it, we haven't been typically used with developers on coding their machine before they commit anything towards shared. So that's new for us. All of us to be closer to the developer, closer to the clients in many ways and also allows us to really get extremely high flexibility information for what happens from the time the code is committed to all the way through the release of production. So very good change level with there. So we are super excited about it, because it's a company that built a great product in a short amount of time and we are very excited about the -- about building a common product together. Right now, we are busy, that we're planning to sunset the [indiscernible] and to rebuild in the data platform to have it being maximally integrated and the team is hard at towards that right now.\nParthiv Varadarajan: Okay, got it Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Sec. Your line is now open.\nPat Walravens: Thank you for getting me in. So Oli, I'd like to ask you pretty much the same question, I asked you last quarter, which was -- you've been doing this for 20-years, you've seen a number of sort of slowdowns in the economy. How does this point feel in comparison? And then just to remind you, last time you said that the one thing you've learned was that you don't really know where it's going, until it's over. So do you still feel the same way or what have you learned?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, I think, we knew, like this thing we knew last time was that we wouldn't exactly know what would happen. We had some ideas and some of the things we thought would happen -- did happen, some others happened a little bit differently. So when we thought about Q2 back in Q1, we thought we might see elevated churn. We thought we might see certain parts of our customer base being much more affected than others. And it's not exactly what happened. We actually, didn't see the churn we're expecting to see, but we saw a broader slowdown among a certain category of our largest current customer. I mean in retrospect, you can explain easily, you understand the behavior, you see what's happening. And it makes sense. I think predicting it before that would be a difficult part. So going back to where we are today, we're super confident about where we are, what the products doing in the market, core customers are adopting it, developing the various parts of it and are growing with it. The one thing we are a little bit more careful about is, our understanding of what's going to happen over the next few month -- the next few quarters as we will maybe get it's way through the end of the pandemic hopefully.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Hey, thanks very much. Hi guys, and thanks for taking the questions. For Olivier, the increased level of cloud optimization among larger customers that you saw this quarter. Do you think that this will have any impact on the pace of multi-cloud adoption going forward?\nOlivier Pomel: I don't think so, because when customers are adopting multi-cloud, like they typically have one cloud of scale. You know, the smaller one in addition to that. So I think it is going to adopt the -- to impact mostly their cloud of scale first. That's my guess. And maybe what we've seen in some cases, but we'll see what happens. Again, it's a little bit harder to tell, so that's my guess.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thanks. And then just for David, your growth in RPO on a year-over-year basis did decelerate quite a bit this quarter. I think you said that your annual contract billing has remained strong and that you were coming up against some longer duration contracts from a year ago. And I know, you don't break out current RPO. Just wondering, if you have any commentary on duration adjusted RPO growth or just how we should be thinking about that?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, you're exactly right. The RPO -- the current RPO is similar growth to the billings much closer to the revenues in the 60s. The difference there is the timing of multi -- of some multi-year contracts in the second quarter of last year. So the billing duration didn't -- the billing period you see didn't change. The contract duration came down slightly, just because those contracts are being consumed, and that's the reason why we had a current RPO, it would be much more aligned with the billings and the revenue.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, very clear. Very helpful, thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yes.\nOperator: And right now, I would like to turn it over to Mr. Olivier Pomel. Please continue.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. All right. So to close this call, I would like to repeat that we are very pleased with our execution in Q2, against what has been a challenging backdrop. And while the macro environment has presented near-term uncertainties, the situation has made it more imperative than ever for businesses to be digital first and in the cloud. We believe Datadog is ideally positioned to be a primary beneficiary of these long-terms and we continue to invest to capture that opportunity. So, I want to thank you all for attending the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participations. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thank you, AJ and thank you all for joining us today. Before discussing the results of the quarter, I want to proudly report that together with our employees, we raised over $1 million for charities supporting COVID release, as well as organizations working to dismantle the systemic discrimination experienced by black communities. We are living in unprecedented times for many reasons, and we want to do our part to help. And as always, Datadog is committed to supporting diversity and inclusion within our company and communities. Now turning to Q2 results, we are happy to report another quarter of strong growth and demonstrated financial efficiencies. Execution was strong during challenging times, including robust new logo generation and continued platform adoption. While we are pleased with our execution in the quarter, we did experience some impact to the rate of usage growth of our customers related to the micro environment. While this macro uncertainty remains in the near-term, we continue to believe that this environment accentuate the need to be digital first and agile and confirms the cloud as the best path to achieve these outcomes over the long-term. And we see evidence of this in growing overall demand in the form of new customers and new use cases for existing customers. To summarize, Q2 at a high level, revenue was $140 million, an increase of 68% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,015 customer with ARR of $100,000 or more, which is an increase of 71% from last year. These customers generate about 75% of our ARR. We have about 12,100 customers, which represent growth of 37% from about 8,800 last year. We also continued to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $19 million. And as in past quarters, our dollar based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted on newer products. So we are continuing to deliver high growth at scale. Now looking at Q2 in more detail. New logo generation was robust in the quarter as new logo ARR grew both from last quarter and year-over-year and gross new customers additions matched to the record set in Q1. We saw companies of all sizes and geographies prioritize cloud migration and digital transformation. For instance in the quarter, we had a few small yet notable new logo wins from two global auto chains, an amusement park chain, a large US university and a European airline. These wins showed that even in the face of challenging times for these customers, transforming to ensure business resilience and longevity is a top priority. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q2, 68% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 40% a year ago, we had another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products and I would add that over 15% of our customers are now using four or more products, while we had zero last year. We are also very pleased with the uptake of our newest products in a short period of time, with Synthetics, RUM, NPM and Security all released over the last year. We are winning in the market, because we are cloud native, our support of cloud and other ephemeral architectures is more important than ever as a rapid change from work from home has demonstrated the limitation of legacy infrastructure. And we believe recent events will accelerate the migration to the cloud as the economy improves. We win because we offer the broader solution with end-to-end visibility from backend infrastructure, all the way through to the end user experience and now security as well. And we win because we offer a truly integrated platform, voicing OpenView into the IT stack. Now, as we mentioned earlier, while execution was strong, the macro environment did have some impact on our top line results, and in particular on growth of existing customers. Our customers continue to grow usage of our platform in Q2, but the rate of this growth was below the trends we saw before the pandemic. This dynamic was primarily seen in our larger customers, who already had sizable cloud environment. Given macro uncertainty, we saw these customers look to conserve cash where they still could and therefore, optimize the consumption of cloud infrastructure. On the flip side, smaller customers and large enterprises that are earlier in their cloud journey continue to see stronger growth. To put it plainly, customers with large cloud deals from AWS, Azure or GCP look for short-term savings. Note that this is not a new motion, as we see many enterprises go through these optimization exercises on a regular basis. What was unusual this quarter was to see a large number of companies going through it at the same time. I would also note that while these customers are the greatest scale in the cloud, they mostly remain at a low penetration relative to their overall IT environment. Therefore, these customers continue to have a long runway of growth in their cloud adoption over time. Lastly, while we do not want to get into the habit of providing intra-quarter update, I'd like to provide some commentary on what we saw in July. Given the unique macro seconds ended. We saw over the last month, a notable improvement in usage growth relative to Q2, driven by broad-based strength across our customer base. It is however too soon to know, if this growth will sustain given the macro environment. As a result and while we are encouraged by these trends, we remain prudently conservative in our outlook for the remainder of the year, which David will speak to. As a reminder, we have both a subscription and usage based revenue model and the growth of our revenue is relative to the growth of our customer's cloud footprint and data volume. Finally, to bookend this topic, I'm very proud of the performance of our go-to-market teams during the challenging times. As we are executing well against what we can control and our teams are delivering record levels of new logos and product cross-sell. Next on to R&D, we continue to make significant investments to rapidly deliver innovation. We have a proven track record of success introducing new products and we see many new opportunities to expand our portfolio. For example, we recently announced the general availability of private locations for Synthetics, which enables dev and ops teams to proactively test internal applications that are not accessible from the public Internet. We also acquired Undefined Lab, a provider of observability for dev and test workflows. This will enable Datadog to be injected earlier in the software lifecycle starting before code is even committed to a central repository. And this will equip customers with better tracking of continuous integration and deployment workflows and enable them to identify issues before reaching production. Other continued product innovations include the general availability of the Datadog mobile app to provide engineers with access to the alerts and dashboards on the go, support for Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to enable streaming logs directly from AWS services to Datadog; and the preview release of the Datadog IoT agent to provide visibility into Internet of Things devices. We have also added and improved a number of integrations including AWS 1-click deploy, HiveMQ, Apache Ignite and Hazelcast. As we keep investing in R&D, we plan for continued rapid pace of innovation and we'll be showcasing some of our newer products at our Annual User Conference, Dash, which is held online next week on August 11. Switching gears a bit, we recently achieved FedRAMP authorization for low-impact SaaS, and Datadog is now fully available in the FedRAMP marketplace. We continue to build out our public sector go to market motion and while it is likely to take some time. We are excited about this long-term opportunity. Now let's talk briefly about several wins in the quarter. First, we had a seven-figure of sale with a large FinTech company. With Datadog, this customer has been able to move from multiple disparate monitoring tools using a single platform for all three pillars of observability. This allowed them to refocus engineering teams on building new features and they expect more than $1 million in savings from consolidating disparate monitoring logging vendors into Datadog. Another seven figure expansion came from a European automotive company, which is modernizing and adopting Microsoft Azure. Through adoption of Datadog Infrastructure Monitoring APM and NPM, their teams are now collaborating on a share platform and are moving to an increasingly agile development model. Next, we saw a large entertainment platform that had been using more and more of our products, commit to over $10 million in ARR. This company has made a decision to increase investment in observability and their use of Datadog both with new products and by scaling up on existing products. And we also mentioned a high six figure land deal with a leading asset manager, which is now using us for infrastructure monitoring APM and logs as well as Synthetics and early adoption of security. And last, we had a six figure upsell to a seven figure ARR with a social networking platform that has seen tremendous growth during the pandemic. At record levels of scale, they can use Datadog to quickly drill down into any sale request and easily identify layers, this company is now using all three pillars, including Synthetics, RUM and NPM, and has standardized monitoring on Datadog. Now, moving on to our outlook. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we remain very excited about our market opportunity. Recent events have made one thing very clear, it is more important than ever to be a digital first business and the cloud is the best path to achieve this outcome. We continue to believe Datadog is the primary beneficiary of these trends and remains very well positioned to win in the market. In the near-term, the macro environment is likely to continue to cause uncertainty, but our focus remains on executing on executing against our strategic priorities, which have not changed. First, we are building on our strong track record of innovation by introducing new products, entering new categories and continuing to improve existing solutions. Second, we continue to hire rapidly in R&D and are pursuing talent that would not otherwise get in the market. And third, we are aggressively expanding our go-to-market globally and into newer channel. We are very confident that we continue to sustain strong growth both in the near-term and over time. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? Yes. So the first thing I'd say is, it's something we've seen before, it happens from time to time like companies ramp up their cloud consumption at some point, their bills going up and they ask themselves can we optimize. And look we've done that too as a company. If you've seen our gross margins. For example, go up from last year that was fairly similar in that respect. What happened there is that everybody has the same idea at the same time like everybody ask themselves, how can we save some cash. The word came pretty much every single company effected down by COVID, because of the uncertainties, cash have to be conserved. One of the good things about cloud is that a lot of it is opex and a lot of it is -- still had to be paid -- has to be paid in the next bill, it's not some costs, so there are still savings to be made. If you take action, so that's what we saw happen. In terms of it, continuing on that, again it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the near-term, but in the broader scheme of thing, companies are still moving to the cloud, but new companies are moving to the cloud that were not before and we've mentioned that on the call. That we've had a number of asset -- key companies that started using us right now, when you think of hotel chains and amusement parks and things like that. We see though -- in the July data and even some of the June data that companies that have optimized their cloud infrastructure. And by the way, in general what we mean by that is not that call Datadog to cut their bill to cut data bill, is that they're trying to figure out what they could shutdown or optimize on the Amazon side, or on the Google side on the Azure side. And so while we see some decrease of their data volume or infrastructure side view over -- period of a few weeks, but then what we see after that is that they start going again, because then their team keeps building and they keep deploying, keeps having customer etc, etc. So it's not an exercise that is new or unexpected. I think what's different now is that, it's a -- it makes sense for all of these companies to be at the same time and it just happened. Yes. So I think we are -- so we are very careful about pricing, in that the way we do it is, first of all, we encourage having the maximum deployments with our customers, meaning that's why we don't charge by the user, we want absolutely everybody to use it. And then we want to make sure that customers have the levers to align pricing to able to pay to Datadog with value they get. And in our case, that means, having differentiated pricing for very different parts of our platform, because not every single gigabytes of data that is being sent to us has the same value to the customer and represents the same amount of processing and other things online. So we try to align that. Right now, we're happy with our pricing model. It works well in the market. It gives customers the flexibility, but look we've had our pricing model evolve over time, it will probably still evolve in the future. We believe in our ability to winning the market -- at least winning the market and give a more and more value you have pricing power in the long-term and that's where we are today, we want to be in the future. I think when you -- when your only tool is to play on pricing, like it's usually bad news. It means you can't actually win based on the quality of your products alone. No, I think what we've seen mostly is they're slowing the usage of the cloud infrastructure that's directly related to how we recognize new revenue. So that's what we thought. To put in another terms, they use less Amazon instances or containers or less Azure instances and containers. And that's -- that would end up move the needle for us. And I should say, this is something that we used to see it in the other way, we used to see, like the way we sell it, we send to customers and they're still early in their cloud transition and we grow with them as they grow. What happened this quarter is that their growth slowed overall during the quarter, they still grew and they are still going to grow and what we said in the call is -- in July, so towards the June, we saw some acceleration of the growth again, but we want to remain prudent considering all the uncertainties there is right now in terms of, how long the COVID crisis is going to last and what's going to be the impact in various parts of the economy. We remain prudent in what we think is going to happen in the near-term. We haven't seen any changes there. And everything that that is within control of the sales team actually worked pretty well. We mentioned during the call but -- so we had a record level of new logos, both in terms of numbers and in terms of revenue. We had a record level of new product attach. And this is where our sales team spend their time on. The growth of customers once they are set up every single month, it did only partially related to the world of [indiscernible] like we don't have full control over that, which is also why when we set expectations around our net retention initially, we said we're going to sell at 130%, because we don't fully control that number. A great part of this is driven by the rate of migration to the cloud and the rate at which customers are scaling to the cloud. Again, we're very early in that transition and customers are going to keep transitioning for much longer time, they keep scaling and we see that they only wanted to do that more now they see the impact of COVID on their business and the need to transform. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis. In the near-term, we don't exactly know where that's going. Yes. So they are both in hyper growth. So the picture hasn't changed a lot since the last time we talked. The infrastructure iPhone would still be a great public company, logs and APM are still in hyper growth not growing much faster than Datadog grows at this scale and the other products that are smaller and earlier are also growing extremely fast right now. So we -- overall we're fairly happy with those. Yes, which is important to understand. The signs of active demand are really strong, whether it's new logo, new products that we -- that rate is actually up from what they've been before and we keep -- this keeps growing over time. So all that is great. The one thing that's been a detractor this quarter has been I would say the passive consumption. I don't like the word passive, because it sounds like we're not doing anything, and customer is not doing anything, but it's something that not directly related to an actual customer they are taking with us today. Yes, so for this kind of changes like we -- we always have to keep an open mind, while we see, what can work and not work. At the same time, look we don't see that having a major impact on us, because we don't actually, our business as you said is mostly Greenfield and you saw today on the strength of our individual product that get tied together in a platform, and there is no problem with our customers adopting our products, little by little. Like they can adapt as little as they want as APM, as little as they want as log and that of their infrastructure, or as little as they want Synthetics, that's not an issue, that's already something we have. We actually give them differentiated pricing that tells that is more tailored to the value they agreed to get for each of those product. So I don't see anything very disruptive there or anything very different. So again from our end, there is no, it won't be a change there. Well there is definitely a correlation, and we don't call it exactly with them, right, because they have different product portfolios and some of these tied to what we do today, the kind of the products that we already have for our customers to consume. But the -- what I will say is we understand the dynamics of what happened to these top providers. We saw it happened to these -- to their customers basically, which is they try to save for the next deal, because every million dollar counts in big companies right now. And before they know where their prices is going, they want to make sure they do everything they can. So we have -- we have quality today. And the one thing I will say is, we are growing a lot faster than the cloud providers, because we keep adding more products and we're still underpenetrated in the market. So we are growing a lot faster than they are. And we are still growing faster even in more recent quarters. No, we didn't change anything. The sales incentives are the same. The way we sell, we have the teams to do is the same. So we haven't changed anything to the -- the way we proceed. The -- we're doing right now is working, right. What we said earlier is, we did bring the right numbers of new logos, the right numbers of product cross-sell that was our focus before, that's still our focus today. The rest, the growth in usage will come because the transition into digital businesses move to the cloud is not going to stop. Welcome. Yes. So this quarter was actually. I mean, David, I hope you don't -- let's say, if I take a numbers question. But... The way the scope that this quarter was a little bit different in that what we saw from early July was fairly consistent with what we had before in Q1. So we saw good growth and great behavior on the logos, which is what we discussed in last call. Sorry, I mentioned, not July -- April. The first few weeks of April were very good growth and new logos. Our new logos remain for the rest of the quarter. But what we saw is towards the end of April and then the full month of May, we had much lower growth. And then things recovered -- had started recovering in June, so growth was going up in June, and is recovering further in July. So these are the trends we've seen. Now, so this is what we saw past quarter, it was a lot noisier than what we used to. Like we're used to having very consistent numbers month over month. We can't really tell whether in the near-term, we will see some return to the previous normal or if we'll still see some oscillation as the state of the economy and other things provoke the same emotions in our customers. Yes. So we -- now if look, it's still super early right, it's a very, very early product, it has some very focused use cases to start with for some very focused types of customers. We're very happy with the uptake that we did get a good start in terms of customers planning to use it and pay for it. But again, super, super early. So I think maybe we'll talk about it some more in the future when it becomes more material and we have -- when we have more products to talk about there, but we are -- we say we're excited, but still early, still a lot of work to do. Yes. You're thoroughly right. I think on the -- for the bulk of our product portfolio. We still talk to buyers that are going to be the same or working the same way, for everything that relates to observability I will say. When it comes to security, in some cases, now we are starting to see some different buyers. So today, we are still selling the same way. I mean, the security product is focused enough in terms of the customers we're going after that it works that way, but it's something that we're monitoring, it's possible that we'll make changes in the future to that motion. Nothing yet, we'll get more data, we'll get more and we'll see more how the product behave and how the customers behave as we keep expanding the target audience for that product. But that's something that we're aware of, and we're monitoring. Yes, I think it's more for all of the internal services that are being exposed. In fact, companies that don't have a web safety UI. One of the -- in fact as many great advantage is but for me it's more difficult to go and reaching to test some endpoints that are not exposed to the Internet. So that solves that. So it allows customers to put probably inside their own networks to automatically test and verify their APIs and their web application, but it also allows them to install probs in a networks they might manage or their -- or that their employees might be using for example, they might deploy that at either a cable providers or basically cloud providers things that we -- we're not hosted in as Datadog, but they want to monitor it directly. So it opens a whole range of possibilities for them. Thanks. So, yes, so we've -- since it's a fairly recent program for us. We've had great uptake like we signed up for large number of partners, actually larger than we thought we would. I don't think we've communicated that number publicly. So I will not do it today. But it's been off to a strong start. I think we're working on making sure we have the right process in place, so we can enable those partners and develop them, so not enough to just be a partner, but there are different levels of partnerships, that are also going to have different expectations in terms of what they provide to us, we will provide to them. And so we're working on promoting for partners to -- for different levels right now. So far we've seen some interesting outputs on that. So we've closed deals, large deals, much earlier than we thought through partners. And we've done that in multiple regions. We haven't seen a specific impact on COVID just because that partner network is still new, that it's growing very fast, no matter what. And we can focus on the partners that want to grow now and that have opportunities now as opposed to maintaining the large base of existing partners. So far with the early plus signs, but a lot more to do. David, do you want to take this one? One thing that's interesting is that the pandemic is hitting different parts of the world at different times. So we have these -- very possible to get turned out and turned off at different times and we've seen that through Q2 basically. Again, it's hard to tell what's going to happen in Q3 with respect to that. Yes, so what's very interesting with Undefined is that they focus completely on what happens when developers check their own codes first on their own machine and then to share Naxi ITD process until it ends up being deployed in production. So it's not an area where we've been present before it, we haven't been typically used with developers on coding their machine before they commit anything towards shared. So that's new for us. All of us to be closer to the developer, closer to the clients in many ways and also allows us to really get extremely high flexibility information for what happens from the time the code is committed to all the way through the release of production. So very good change level with there. So we are super excited about it, because it's a company that built a great product in a short amount of time and we are very excited about the -- about building a common product together. Right now, we are busy, that we're planning to sunset the [indiscernible] and to rebuild in the data platform to have it being maximally integrated and the team is hard at towards that right now. Yes, I think, we knew, like this thing we knew last time was that we wouldn't exactly know what would happen. We had some ideas and some of the things we thought would happen -- did happen, some others happened a little bit differently. So when we thought about Q2 back in Q1, we thought we might see elevated churn. We thought we might see certain parts of our customer base being much more affected than others. And it's not exactly what happened. We actually, didn't see the churn we're expecting to see, but we saw a broader slowdown among a certain category of our largest current customer. I mean in retrospect, you can explain easily, you understand the behavior, you see what's happening. And it makes sense. I think predicting it before that would be a difficult part. So going back to where we are today, we're super confident about where we are, what the products doing in the market, core customers are adopting it, developing the various parts of it and are growing with it. The one thing we are a little bit more careful about is, our understanding of what's going to happen over the next few month -- the next few quarters as we will maybe get it's way through the end of the pandemic hopefully. I don't think so, because when customers are adopting multi-cloud, like they typically have one cloud of scale. You know, the smaller one in addition to that. So I think it is going to adopt the -- to impact mostly their cloud of scale first. That's my guess. And maybe what we've seen in some cases, but we'll see what happens. Again, it's a little bit harder to tell, so that's my guess. Thank you. All right. So to close this call, I would like to repeat that we are very pleased with our execution in Q2, against what has been a challenging backdrop. And while the macro environment has presented near-term uncertainties, the situation has made it more imperative than ever for businesses to be digital first and in the cloud. We believe Datadog is ideally positioned to be a primary beneficiary of these long-terms and we continue to invest to capture that opportunity. So, I want to thank you all for attending the call."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we delivered strong second quarter top and bottom line results amid a difficult macro backdrop. Revenue was $140 million, up 68% year-over-year, against the challenging compare. Execution was strong with robust new logo generation and continued platform traction. While the macro environments did pressure usage of existing customers. To provide some more context. First, in Q2 we strong -- we saw strong new logo additions with robust contributions from both enterprise and commercial sales channels and sequential growth of new logo ARR. Execution against our platform has been very strong with 68% of customers now using two or more products versus just 40% a year ago driven by both lands and cross-selling. In the second quarter, our dollar based net retention was once again above 130% for the 12th consecutive quarter. We saw continued growth of our existing customers, driven by both increased usage of existing solutions and robust cross-selling to newer solutions. Our net retention rate, which remains best-in-class above 130% did however decline from Q1. As Olivier discussed, macro factors pressured usage increases. To add some detail. First, while existing customers did grow, the rate of growth was below pre-pandemic levels. This was primarily seen from our larger customers with a greater scale in the cloud, who experienced business pressures and softer save in the near-term by slowing down their consumption. Additionally, one dynamic, which we discussed as a possibility on our Q1 call is that we did see the normalization of some spike usage from Q1. In March, we had a number of customers such as streaming media vendors, scale rapidly in the face of COVID. Over the following months, some of these customers were able to optimize usage and save on cloud spending amid budget pressures and normalization of business activities. Next, some customers such as delivery and media companies, have continued to see elevated demand and therefore have continued to meaningfully grow their Datadog usage. Lastly, we saw some of our COVID impacted customers reduce usage. As a reminder, these customers such as those in hospitality and travel contribute less than 10% of our ARR and therefore, they were a mild track detractor. Lastly, churn was a bit elevated related to the most hard hit COVID customers, but better-than-expected. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the low to mid-90s. Performance of our SMB customer base has been robust including stable dollar based churn and continued rapid growth year-over-year. Now turning to billings, which was $160.1 million and up 62% year-over-year relatively in line with revenue growth. Entering the quarter. As we discussed on the last call, we thought it was possible some customers would seek to renegotiate terms or slow payments but that did not happen in a material way, pointing to the importance of our solution. Remaining performance obligations or RPO was $287 million, up 53% year-over-year. We did not see a material change in billings durations in Q2. We did see some slight shortening of contract duration year-over-year related to large multiyear contracts closed in the year ago quarter. We continue to have great success in closing annual committed deals, which remains our strategic focus. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate versus revenues based on the timing of invoicing and signing of customer contracts while revenue incorporates customer usage. Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $111.8 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% also last quarter and 75% in the year ago period. Year-over-year improvement of gross margin was driven by efficient use in our cloud hosting. Our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter with an acceptable ranges, as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies. R&D expense was $38.3 million or 27% of revenue, compared to 30% in the year ago quarter. We have continued to invest significantly in R&D as Olivier mentioned, including high growth of our engineering headcount. However, the growth of revenue continues to outpace even our substantial investments and we did have some leverage from T&E and overhead savings related to work from home. We continue to see a meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D going forward. Sales and marketing expenses were $45.7 million or 33% of revenue, compared to 42% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments, but the pace of revenue growth has outpaced that investment. This was the first full quarter of no in-person trade shows for marketing events. While we have successfully redeployed much of the event's budget to advertising and other lead generating activities. It is not so on a one-for-one ratio. G&A expense was $12.5 million or 9% in revenue, in line with the same ratio a year ago quarter. Operating income was $15.3 million or an 11% operating margin, compared to a loss of $5 million and a negative 7% margin in the year ago period. Beyond the improvement in gross margin and revenues outpacing investments, the reduction in travel and entertainment and facilities overhead contributed to the operating margin. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $17.5 million or $0.05 per share based on 331 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Note that our non-GAAP net income, does not include the $5.6 million non-cash benefit related to payroll taxes. We have a very efficient business model and experience a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have delivered four consecutive quarters of breakeven to positive operating income, we note that our priority remains top line growth, and we intend to continue investments aggressively in R&D and go to market. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, which includes the $641 million of proceeds from our convertible note issuance during the quarter, net of issuance costs and the cap call transaction. Cash flow from operations was $24.7 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $18.6 million in the quarter for a margin of 13%. Free cash flow includes an approximately $4.4 million outflow related to the conclusion of our first employee stock purchase program. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full-year 2020. We are pleased with our execution and ability to drive new sales in an uncertain macro environment. As discussed, we did see some lower growth in usage from our existing customers in Q2, due to the overall slowing of the economy. As Olivier noted, however, in July, we experienced an improvement in usage trends relative to Q2 that were closer to our pre-pandemic historical levels. However, it is too soon to know if this will prove to be sustainable and given the lack of clarity of economic trends, we are assuming usage growth of existing customers below pre-COVID growth rates. Additionally, while we have not yet seen a material impact to our new sales, we think it is prudent to expect some impact in the second half given that the macro backdrop. Beginning with the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $143 million to $145 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 50% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of a loss of $1 million to an income of $1 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be breakeven to $0.01 per share based on approximately 333 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now for the full-year 2020, revenue is expected to be in the range of $566 million to $572 million, which represents a 57% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $28 million to $34 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share based on approximately 332 million of fully -- weighted average fully diluted shares. A few things to take into account in our guidance. First, when evaluating our quarterly growth rates, it is important to consider the accelerated growth rates in the second half of 2019 creating more challenging comps. Next, while we see continued improvement in our gross margins, we are running towards the top end of our long-term target. As we prioritize product development and diversifying our cloud hosting vendors and regions, our gross margins may fluctuate within a range of acceptability. Next, as I mentioned earlier, our intention continues to be to invest meaningfully, including aggressive hiring in R&D and sales and marketing and we have not changed our plans during COVID. Then some notes below operating income. We expect approximately $2.4 million of quarterly non-GAAP other income, which is net including interest income in our cash and marketable securities, less the interest expenses of our convertible debt. Next, we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer, but have a tax provision related to our international entities, we expect a tax provision of approximately $350,000 per quarter. Note, that our share count forecast for Q3 and the full-year are diluted given that we expect to be non-GAAP net income breakeven profitable for both periods. To summarize, we are pleased with our execution during a very challenging time. While the macro environment has impacted our topline results in the near-term, we believe the current environment will prove to be a catalyst for digital transformation and cloud migration over the long-term. And we are very well positioned to be a primary beneficiary of those trends. We have a highly efficient business model and are making investments across the organization today in order to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yes, I think that's right. We have our guidance throughout our history as a public company been fairly prudent and our forward-looking usage and implicit net retention and we're particularly cognizant of that given COVID, most of our guidance has conservative assumptions in that and we continue to do that. I think as we said, we had strong cross sell. And so we see a continued adoption of the platform, which is a good sign and as far as the usage. The more variable usage we saw as Oli just mentioned some constraints. So we tried to use conservative assumptions going forward in our guidance. Thank you. Yes, that was one of the surprises we had very stable gross churn, dollar based gross churn and it's very similar to what we have discussed in the last call that all over the metrics and growths are in the 90s with enterprise tending to be towards the upper part of that range and SMB towards the lower, but all of them strong and in the 90s. We really didn't see very much disruption from that. And similarly, we saw net retention rates come down, we said a little more at the larger end because of this concentration on costs. But all within the same type of bands, we've had since we've become a public company. Yes. And the attach rates and their contribution to net retention, has been very similar to the trends that we've talked about last time. So we continue to have increasing number of customers using the platform and there -- what they're spending on the additional components of the platform continues to grow in hyper growth. No. Go ahead. We didn't have that and what we -- we didn't present the pro forma, because it wasn't as impactful. We did say in RPOs we had the multi-year contracts, and a quarter ago, which were more concentrated than we had in creating RPO, but it didn't affect the billings numbers that much. And so there was nothing to point out. Sorry, I can't hear you. No issues with? Yes, we haven't -- nothing that we are pointing out on this call. So we -- nothing that we wanted to point out. Yes. Yes. We are continuing as we've talked about before, to build out regions either when we get to critical mass and have a successful sales team or when we're landing in new territories, so we're continuing the same plan we had which is to build out Asia complete, the build out of EMEA, as well as to expand in some areas like Latin America. We saw good performance as we've talked about before in the second quarter in EMEA on the back of the build outs we had done, and as we said all along, we're earlier in Asia, building out teams and filling out teams for the first time. So we'll continue that as part of our plan in the remainder of the year. Yes, you're exactly right. The RPO -- the current RPO is similar growth to the billings much closer to the revenues in the 60s. The difference there is the timing of multi -- of some multi-year contracts in the second quarter of last year. So the billing duration didn't -- the billing period you see didn't change. The contract duration came down slightly, just because those contracts are being consumed, and that's the reason why we had a current RPO, it would be much more aligned with the billings and the revenue. Yes."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you A.J. and thank you all for joining us today. Before reviewing the quarter, I'd like to take some time to address the situation we're all facing with the COVID pandemic and in particular our internal response to the crisis the ways in which the pandemic intersects with our business but also some of the data we've seen in March and April as well as our stance for the year and our perspective on the future. So, starting with our response. We communicated three objectives internally: first to keep our employees safe healthy and sane; second to be good citizens and members of our communities and contribute to our collective health and economic success; and last, but not least, to serve our customers level down innovation and be the best at what we do for challenging times as well as good. In keeping with those objectives, we have mandated work from home since March 12th. In addition to that we have allocated a grant to each of our employees to support their productivity and safety. And at three discretion employees could elect to donate all or a portion of their grant to charities that help with COVID relief. I'm very proud to say that this program has already resulted in $1 million of donations from our employees and reflects the generosity and our commitment to go through this crisis together with the communities in which we operate. I also have to say that I've been extremely impressed with Datadog employees' resilience, continued productivity, and innovation through this time. Our success in pivoting to operate remotely does demonstrate the advantage of being a digital-first cloud-based business. Regarding the way the pandemic may affect Datadog, there are a few important structural points to understand about our business. First, we have a very diverse customer base. We estimate that less than 10% of our ARR comes from categories most negatively impacted by COVID such as hospitality and travel airlines and in personal entertainment. On the other hand we also have exposure to categories that have experienced increasing traffic such as streaming media gaming food delivery e-commerce and collaboration. Second, we also have a great diversity of customer sizes. We have low concentration and approximately 75% of our ARR comes from customers that pay us $100,000 or more. Also less than 50% [Later changed by the Company to 15%] of our ARR comes from a long tail of small businesses. Third, we price according to our customers' infrastructure footprint and not per seat. So, our product usage is not directly affected by reductions in the workforce. Fourth our business model is low-friction land and expand and our platform is adopted bottom up. We often land fast and small as enterprises begin their cloud migration and then we frictionlessly expand from there as more workloads move to the cloud. This makes our sales effort less dependent on physical meetings and makes our model is extremely efficient and less reliant on larger front deals. Lastly, we are pure SaaS and require no professional services or hand-on-keyboard implementation. Now, turning to what we've seen in March and April. First of all, the COVID escalation happened late enough in the first quarter to not materially affect our financial results. Throughout the quarter, we saw consumption continue to increase across the platform and growth of the number of hosts, containers metrics traces and logs, for example, have remained consistent with historical trends. We started to see some negative effects in impacted industries such as travel, hospitality and airlines. But we've also seen substantially increased usage from other categories such as streaming media, gaming, food delivery and collaboration, as these customers scaled up their operations in this environment. We also saw a surge of usage and surge in accounts in March in response to COVID that we expect could be more transitory in nature and may normalize over time. In terms of new deals, we did have a strong end of the quarter with limited impact from COVID. As far as Q2 goals, our pipeline is robust and relatively consistent with prior quarters, but it is still too early to know the impact COVID could have on the road. Because of that and given the macro uncertainty, it is prudent to expect delay of some new cloud migration projects as well as some impact on churn. As David will discuss, the effect of COVID has been incorporated in our guidance. To close on the COVID dynamic, let's step back and look at our stance for the rest of the year and perspective on the future. While there is a lot more certainty across the industry and the broader economy in the very near term, we believe it is more important than ever for businesses to operate online, and that the trends of digital transformation and cloud migration remain very much intact over the long-term and may even be accelerated or amplified. We believe we are well positioned to be a primary beneficiary of this trend and continue to win in the market. And we also believe that the efficiency of our business, whether it is our unit economics or balance sheet, our ability to innovate will be an advantage in a difficult market. As such our plans remain clear. We are investing across the board. We're investing in the development of existing and new products including aggressive R&D recruiting targets and taking advantage of the opportunity to attract talent that would otherwise not be on the market. We're investing in the growth of our go-to-market team across segments and geographies. We're investing in our relationship with customers as some of them go through difficult times and it is more important than ever for them to operate digitally. And we're investing in our existing employees to keep them safe and sane through this crisis. To conclude on this point, I would say that while I can't promise for macro reasons that we'll see the same incredibly fast return on these investments as we have historically. We are very confident in the mid and long-term opportunity in front of us and in our strategic plan to live up to it. Now on to Q1, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter. Results were once again driven by broad-based strength across new logos and expansions as well as across customer segments and sales channels. To summarize Q1, revenue was $131 million, an increase of 87% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 960 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, which is an increase of 89% from last year. These customers generate approximately 75% of our ARR. We also continue to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $19 million and a tax payback that is still around a year or less. We ended the quarter with about 11,500 customers, which is about 40% growth from 8,200 last year, which means we added about 1,000 net new customers in the quarter, which was twice the number we added last year. And as in past quarters, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. From an R&D perspective, we continued a rapid pace of innovation. We recently announced the general availability of our Security Monitoring products to unify visibility across security dev and ops teams. As with all our products, it is available in the same integrated simple-to-use SaaS platform. We are pleased with the initial response to this product, and it has been the most demanded beta in company history. But I'll remind you that we are just beginning on the journey to break the silos between security dev and ops, and we plan for continued innovation in this category. Additionally, we recently crossed 400 out of the box integrations. And among a number of new and improved, I'd like to call out Tenable, Nessus and VMware Carbon Black, which support our new security use cases. Looking at product usage, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. As of the end of Q1, 63% of our customers were using two or more products, up from 58% in Q4 and 32% last year. In Q1, approximately 75% sorry of our new logos landed with two or more products. And our success in both landing and cross-selling our platform has resulted in the number of customers using two or more products nearly tripling year-over-year. We are very pleased with this continued adoption of our platform, which includes strong initial uptake of our newest products, Network Performance Monitoring and Real User Monitoring. And as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to believe we have a significant opportunity to further expand our product portfolio and grow our addressable market. Now, let's move on to the go-to-market. I have been personally very impressed with our continued productivity across teams during this time. Enterprise sales teams in particular, who are serving companies of more than 5,000 employees, have successfully adapted to selling by phone and video. And as you know, tradeshows and marketing events have been canceled or going virtual. So, we have been redeploying those investments into online advertising, webinars and other activities. Our own user conference Dash is going virtual likely in Q3. Now, let's review some of our key wins in the quarter. First, we had an exciting seven-figure new logo win from a Fortune 100 pharmaceutical company, embarking on a migration to a container-based hybrid cloud. The incumbent legacy tools didn't keep up with their new dynamic stack and Datadog allows for mass adoption across DevOps and executive teams through a single observability platform that all teams can use every day. Next we signed a six-figure new logo deal to provide monitoring for a large health insurance company, embarking on a multi-cloud migration. What's really interesting about this deal is that it was won through a new partnership with one of the world's largest system integrators. This is a great example of success after we announced Datadog Partner Network in January, though, of course, it is still early days for our channel and alliances go-to-market. By the way, both of the new logo deals I just mentioned were closed at the very end of March. Next we had a sizable upsell to a mid-market on-demand logistics company which now spends more than $1 million a year with us. This company has been a customer since 2018, started with infrastructure monitoring and then adopted both APM and log management in 2019. Today this customer is also using Synthetics, NPM and Security Monitoring. What's really interesting in this case is that this customer partnered with us to build out security products and has quickly found value in scanning logs to detect security threats. It is also worth noting that this logistics company has experienced dramatically increased demand with COVID and it has successfully scaled up its operations, avoided performance issues and enabled all its engineers to collaborate remotely all with support from Datadog. Lastly, I'd note a large six-figure upsell to one of the world's largest global financial institutions. This customer plans to migrate thousands of applications over the coming years, with Datadog being the standard across multiple public and private clouds. This is an interesting customer to single out for both its extremely stringent security requirements and its adoption of our serverless monitoring capabilities. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we were very pleased with our first quarter results. I will now review Q1 results in detail. Revenue was $131.2 million, up 87% year-over-year. The quarter's strength was broad-based, driven by new and existing customers, success across segments and sales channels, as well as driven by continued platform adoption. To provide some more context. First, in Q1, we saw strong new logo additions with contributions across sales channels and regions. Additionally, we saw strong continued expansion of existing customers. In the first quarter, our dollar-based net retention rate was above 130% for the 11th consecutive quarter. Our robust retention rate is driven primarily by increased usage of existing products, as well as cross-selling to newer products. As Olivier mentioned, we are pleased with the initial uptake of our newest solutions NPM and RUM. However, I would note that these newest products were immaterial to the results of the first quarter. Lastly, we saw strength across segments, with similar growth rates across enterprise, mid-market and SMB. We were encouraged to see this broad-based strength, including many large enterprise deals which closed in March, as well as strength from our SMB customer base. In the quarter, we saw continued robust dollar rates -- net and gross retention in each of these segments. Now turning to billings, which was $137.9 million and up 55% year-over-year. There are two dynamics here I'd like to call out. First, while we saw billings duration come in a bit in some of our renewals and upsells in the quarter, as some of our clients move to quarterly or semiannual payment terms from prior annual terms, I want to note that this did not result in reduced duration of contract length, merely the payment terms. This was due to customers' cash flow planning amid COVID and our accommodation to their billing preferences. The impact of shorter duration on the quarter was approximately $10 million to billings. Given our very efficient land-and-expand model, however, we are still not dependent on large upfront payments for multi-year deals. Next, there was a smaller impact from the invoice timing of a sizable existing customer, that was invoiced $4 million in Q1 last year and then due to growth was invoiced a second time in 2019, but was not invoiced in Q1 this year. Normalizing for these two impacts, calculated billings growth would have been approximately 70% year-over-year. In addition, as of the end of Q1, our Remaining Performance Obligations or RPO was $256 million and grew 82% year-over-year. RPO measures commitments rather than billing terms. The higher growth of RPO indicates increases in longer-term commitments even when billing terms may be altered. As discussed previously, we discourage the use of billings as a gauge of our momentum as it does not accurately portray the growth of our business. Revenue is a better indicator of growth given that our revenue is directly tied to consumption and due to the tight relationship between revenue and ARR. Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $105.2 million representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and 73% in the year ago period. Improvement in gross margin was driven by efficient use of our cloud hosting. As we said before, our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter within an acceptable range as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies. R&D expense was $35 million or 27% of revenue compared to 31% in the year ago quarter. We have continued to invest significantly in R&D including high growth in our engineering headcount. However, the growth of revenue has outpaced even our substantial investments. We continue to see meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore plan to continue making meaningful investments in R&D. Sales and marketing expense was $42.1 million or 32% of revenues compared to 42% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but the pace of revenue growth has also outpaced this investment. While we have experienced cancellation of marketing events due to COVID, we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead generation activities, but not quite on a one-for-one basis. G&A expense was $12 million in the quarter or 9% of revenue slightly lower than 10% in the year ago period. Operating income was $16.1 million with a 12% operating margin compared to an operating loss of $7 million or a negative 10% margin in the year ago period. Beyond the improvement in gross margin and the other factors discussed above, I'd also like -- I'd also note that reduction in T&E and facilities overhead related to COVID contributed slightly to the operating margin improvement. Net income in the quarter was $18.8 million or $0.06 per share based on 328 million weighted average diluted shares. We have a highly efficient business model and experienced a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have delivered three consecutive quarters of breakeven to positive operating income, we note that our priority remains top-line growth. And we intend to continue aggressive investments in R&D and go-to-market. We have been very successful in interviewing hiring and onboarding remotely. As a result, our plans for hiring and investing remain largely the same as before the corona outbreak. We are investing across the board and believe we are well-positioned to execute on our plans of growth. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $799 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was a positive $24.3 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software free cash flow was a positive $19.3 million in the quarter or a free cash flow margin of 15%. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2020. Given our recurring revenue model, we have not yet felt the effect of COVID-19 on our top line results. It is early in the quarter and we expect that we will see some deal slippage particularly in new logos. We also expect that despite a relatively high net retention rate, we may see some downward pressure in net retention rate in the next two quarters. As Olivier mentioned, the usage of some client surged in March and have adjusted somewhat in April, but remain above pre-COVID levels. It is too soon to know how usage will trend for the remainder of the quarter. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to expect some impact from the above effects most likely in Q2 and Q3 and potentially throughout the rest of the year given our ratable model. And as a result, we have incorporated this into our guidance. Beginning with our second quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be in the range of $134 million to $136 million which represents a year-over-year growth of 62% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of a loss of $1 million to income of $1 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be breakeven to $0.01 positive per share based on approximately 329 million weighted average diluted shares. Turning to the full year. Given our first quarter strength and the drivers of our business, we feel comfortable raising our guidance for 2020 based on what we know today about COVID-19 and the macroeconomic environment. For the full year 2020, revenue is expected to be in the range of $525 million to $565 million, sorry, $555 million to $565 million, which represents a 54% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of breakeven to $10 million positive. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.02 positive to $0.06 positive per share based on 330 million weighted average shares outstanding. A few things to take into account in our guidance, while we do not guide to billings and continue to discourage this as a key metric when putting together your models, we would note that the shorter billing duration impact we talked about in Q1 is likely to continue for the next couple of quarters as customers plan for cash flow amid COVID-19, related to cost drivers, while we've seen continued improvement in our gross margins, we are running towards the top of our long-term target. As we prioritize product development and diversifying our cloud hosting vendors and regions, our gross margins may fluctuate within a range of acceptability. Next, our intention is to invest meaningfully and continue to do so in R&D and sales and marketing. As noted, we have been successful in hiring and on-boarding during COVID. In Q2, we expect an approximately $5.5 million non-cash tax adjustment related to the expiration of a payroll tax liability. Similar to Q2 2019 this will be a benefit to GAAP operating income, but we intend to normalize for it in our non-GAAP results. And, therefore, it is neutral to non-GAAP operating income. Then some notes below operating income. We expect approximately $2 million of interest income per quarter throughout 2020 based on our cash and investments. Next, we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer but have a tax provision related to our international entity. For the full year, we expect a tax provision of a range of $700,000 to $1.5 million. Note that our share forecast for Q2 and the full year are diluted, given that we expect to be a non-GAAP net income profitable company for both periods. Lastly, while we're not giving guidance to cash flow a few things to note. Related to our employee stock purchase program, we've realized an inflow of about $3 million in cash flow from operations in both Q4 and Q1. As the first program concludes, there is a change in geography, whereby, cash flow from operations will decline by $6 million and cash flow from financing activities will increase by $6 million, resulting in no net cash effect. In addition, our new ESPP will produce $2 million to $3 million of new positive cash flow from operations in Q2. Lastly, we expect pressure on billings duration and potentially on DSOs related to COVID, which may cause lower cash generation in the near-term. Given our efficient model, proven cash flow generation, and meaningful cash on the balance sheet this will have no impact on our liquidity. To summarize we were very pleased with the business performance in the first quarter. We continue to deliver growth at scale a few can match and have demonstrated efficiency in our model. While we recognize the challenges that COVID-19 and the macro environment may present, we continue to believe that we are well-positioned for the long-term and plan for continued investments to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions, and congratulations on a strong Q1. And I hope everyone in the New York headquarters is doing well, the employees are doing well, just given all the challenges that we've been going through over the last couple of months, so great to see the Q1 results. I had two questions, one more of a short-term -- shorter-term question and one more of a longer-term question for Olivier. To start with the short term question, I guess what I'm trying to understand is, from what you guys have seen in March and through April and now in early May, the -- what's the sort of the net impact in terms of what you're seeing in the business from the customers that are more impacted the sort of less than 10% of ARR customer -- the spending trends in those customers that are less than 10% of ARR versus some of the increased spending you're seeing in some of the other verticals. So does that sort of net out to neutral in terms of your business plans for the year? Or is it -- are you seeing a net positive effect?\nOlivier Pomel: So I'll answer that. So far, what we see in March, April is that, we see growth. April actually is a robust month. And we -- some customers are impacted and are going slower. Some customers have been scaling up. We have some questions on our end as we discussed on the call on which parts of the scale-ups are going to normalize in the future since we've seen some customers that scrambled late in Q1 and then in April to reorganize the operations and may normalize after that. I would say it's too early to tell where everything nets up. I would think, we need to be prudent in estimating what could happen over the next couple of quarters. But so far from what we can see, we see a lot more reliance on online. We see actually a success story around the cloud. The cloud scaled up. All these companies have been able to move their operations and scale their operations. And we see more investment going on that side. So that's the story so far. And you had a second question?\nSanjit Singh: Yes. My follow-up is sort of trying to think about the world post COVID. And when we look at the product portfolio, it seems like you guys have continued to maintain a rapid pace of innovation. And in terms of coverage, it seems like across security, across the -- I guess now four pillars you have all the products in place that is going to drive really healthy growth for a long time. I'm trying to understand like what the next sort of key buying criteria is going to be. So as we go from observability, is there going to be an element of taking action right? And beyond just monitoring and alerting, do you have the data? Are the products going to be in a place where you can start -- where customers can start taking prescriptive action in terms of their environment? Or maybe even said more simply, where do you see the product portfolio going as we get past COVID?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So we -- look we already have a lot on our hands, right? So I should just restate the fact that our more recent products like APM and logs are in hyper growth. The products we've added after that like Synthetics for example are growing very fast. And there's still a lot of investment that goes into all of these products including our core infrastructure monitoring product. So we still have a lot that we're doing there. When it comes to security, we're still very, very early. What we have is the first product. We're happy that it is in GA. We're happy that it's getting traction. But it's still very early and it has a very long road map. And there's a lot more that we intend to build around it. So now regarding the categories of product you've mentioned like there definitely are some things that are interesting to us in there. And we do have some internal developments in a number of areas. I can't tell you exactly when that is going to be presented to customers and we really have a lot going on.\nSanjit Singh: Fair enough. I\u2019ll leave it there. Congrats on the Q1.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nChris Merwin: Okay. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question and congratulations on the phenomenal results. So in the prepared remarks, you talked about some impact from the delay of projects. But I guess at the same, time there's an opportunity for the pace of digital transformation to actually accelerate in a recovery. And perhaps that's particularly true for customers that were unprepared for a remote workforce. So, can you talk a bit about your customer conversations on that particular topic and how you think about how these trends could impact Datadog post COVID and in recovery?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So, I mean -- look we see what's happening with our customers that have one foot in the digital world and one foot in the -- I would say physical brick-and-mortar world. They're investing heavily in digital art and they see these parts scaling like crazy right now. So that is not going to slow down. And that is actually going to we think accelerate the transformation for the broader industry. Now, at the same time this is happening it is difficult for companies to transform and modernize and make big investments or new investments at a time where many of them are in trouble and have pretty stern constraints on cash and have to make some very hard choices in the short term. So this is -- this is not new. Many other companies have discussed that before over the past few weeks. But I think what we're trying to balance here is, the uncertainty in the short term as these companies go past this urgent transformation or urgent survival mode and the fact that the underlying trend that underpin our success of digital transformation and move to the cloud are just going to accelerate and become more prevalent once the world starts recovering. So the balancing act, it would end up in the guidance we've given basically.\nChris Merwin: Got it. I guess as a related question I think one of the themes we've seen in the space is convergence and that was actually true before COVID. So I mean particularly as customers go through a time when they got to think about perhaps consolidating some of the tools that they have are you seeing actually any benefit from that? I mean could there be a tailwind to the cross-sell motion for specific products? Just curious how you think about.\nOlivier Pomel: This is definitely \u2013 like this was appealing to customers before COVID. It's as appealing if not more to customers now. Some customers might look into ways of rationalizing costs in the short term. So these are all opportunities. At this point none of these \u2013 we don't have data on any of these to be \u2013 to tell you whether it's going to be a big factor or not over the rest of the year. Look this is our strategy. We've been building towards that. So obviously in the long term we believe in it.\nChris Merwin: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. hi, guys. I'm curious in terms of the net new ARR that you added in the quarter how would you characterize how much of that is coming from kind of high-level CIO large complex transactions versus maybe some more kind of day-to-day orders that you get at a divisional or departmental level?\nOlivier Pomel: Well the way we sell in general is always bottom up. Even in large enterprises even when we start the conversation at the CIO level and we end it to the CIO level, the adoption of the product is bottom up. And we start small. Even when we land \u2013 I mentioned earlier on the call like some six or seven figure land deal even when we land those deals these are still a small fraction of what the total opportunity looks like at these customers. And this represent bottom-up adoption and some deals that are going to grow significantly over time. So that's the way it used to work. That's still the way it's working as far as we can tell in Q2.\nSterling Auty: That makes s ense. And then can you give us maybe some qualitative color on the mix of business in terms of you gave us the 75% that landed with two or more products but just give us some color in terms of the strength of infrastructure versus APM versus logging in the quarter.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, I mean look they're all growing. Infrastructure alone would be one of the best SaaS companies around APM and logs. So if we single out those products \u2013 and look we don't really like to do that because as we like to say there's quite a bit of fungibility between the different products and which you attribute to one you could attribute to another. But the \u2013 those products are in hyper growth. They're growing a lot faster than that or used to grow when we were at the scale-up of those products. And that's still the case. That growth hasn't slowed down. Synthetics is still growing much faster than we thought it would. And it's a great product for us. We're pleased with the initial uptake of NPM but it is still not material to our results. We mentioned it earlier but it's a product that has a higher friction than Synthetics for example to get adopted but it has a very long runway. So we're investing in that product. We've seen some adoption of RUM. We started charging in March for some portion of it. So we started charging for a part of it that is \u2013 part of our customers' contract is committed as opposed to being usage driven. So it's still also not material to Q1 but we should see more of it in Q2. And the security product we haven't started charging for yet in Q1 we started in Q2. So we don't have anything to say about it yet.\nDavid Obstler: Sterling I think the trends have really continued. The net retentions were very consistent in Q1 to what they had been and also the contribution from usage and new products and cross-sell. So much of what we've been saying in the last two quarters has continued in Q1 with really strong contribution to net retention from both those effects of usage and cross-sell.\nSterling Auty: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. The \u2013 if you \u2013 you talked about the net retention and the assumptions that you're making as the crisis kind of continues. Can you remind us \u2013 if there's going to be more churn then it's probably going to be more in the SMB space. Can you talk a little bit about your exposure there and what you're seeing so far? It's my first question. And then on the billing side, can you remind us David like in terms of what's monthly versus annually versus where the quarterly biannually that you talked about just to get an idea about the mix. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. I'll about SMB and maybe David can talk about the billing mix. So we actually \u2013 or ARR is as we discussed before is what split evenly between enterprise mid-market and SMB. But even within SMB we \u2013 most of that revenue comes from companies that are on the larger side and on very solid footing financially. Some of them are publicly traded and tend to be closer to the 1000-employee limit there. We mentioned on the call that less than 50% [Later changed by the Company to 15%] of our revenue came from companies that are on the smaller side which is less than 100 employees. If you look at our SMB customers, they're very diverse. And we're actually less exposed on the SMB side to some of the higher-risk categories around COVID. And so far we haven't seen a big change in trends. I mean, we did see a tiny uptick in churn in SMBs, but it's actually consistent with levels we've seen just a few quarters ago. So there's nothing out of the ordinary. And at the same time, we saw an increase of net retention for that same cohort of SMBs. So it has nothing conclusive there. We don't see anything that we didn't see before. Now when we try to guide for the future, we have to try and guess where our exposure is going to be and what can be weaker. We'll have to guess that the SMBs are going to feel more pain and are going to be where we'll see more churn. And so that's what we've incorporated in our guidance. David, do you want to take the billing mix?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. And in billing two-thirds of our \u2013 of ARR is associated with annual commitments or greater. And three-quarters, when you add in the usage related to that so three-quarters of our billings are associated with annual commitments or longer. What we said before was, our average length of commitment went out slightly in the quarter resulting in an acceleration of RPO. And our average period of billing duration came in a little bit more resulting in the billings discussion. But about three-quarters are related to annual commitments or more.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much. Congratulations on a strong start to the year. And as well, I hope everybody at Datadog and everyone listening is doing okay these days. My first question I wanted to follow up on what Sanjit has asked and I think Raimo is alluding to as well. Just trying to understand the impact on the business from COVID. Specifically, if I hear your comments about the potential for deal slippage obviously with more pressure on new logo business and the downward pressure that you might see on net expansion to what extent are you seeing it coming versus just preparing for it? And maybe, if you could perhaps can you compare and contrast consumption trends versus pipeline progression and the conversions on that pipeline that you're seeing in March and into April?\nDavid Obstler: Do you want to go first Oli and I'll weigh in?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Yes. So, yeah. So look it's for the most part we're guessing because it's too early in the quarter to actually have a good sense of what may slip or not. At the end of Q1, we did have a few deals that slipped and that were marked. The reason for slippage was uncertainty around COVID. And several of them have closed right after. And I would say it's not like every quarter there are a few deals that slip. And the number of deals that slipped in Q1 was actually not out of the ordinary compared to previous quarters. So we don't have really anything to quantify the effects we might see but we do anticipate that we will see some. When it comes to usage, again, it's also a little bit more difficult to compare because some of the usage patterns have changed a little bit as companies have scrambled to reorganize. So there's a little bit less predictability in there, which is also why we're baking that into some of our guidance. So overall, look, we do anticipate some uncertainty and some pressure on some fronts in Q2 and Q3. I would be worried, if that didn't happen. But we don't have anything that makes us particularly concerned in front of us right now. David, do you want to add anything?\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Our pipeline remains consistent. We don't know as Oli said is \u2013 what is the harvesting percentage what's going to happen this quarter. So we think that our model given our model of land and expand and usage that were less dependent than other models on going to land in a large three-year deal, but we don't know in new logos particularly what's going to happen as the quarter progresses. The main request we've gotten so far has been some modest can you chunk our builds up a little bit. That's been probably what we've seen a little more. But again, it hasn't been a significant percentage of our ARR either at this point.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks very much. That's both very helpful. If I can follow up with just a quick housekeeping question for you David, RPO up 82% in the period I think is strong by just about any way you look at it. But to just put a finer point, can you give us a duration-adjusted RPO growth or even a current RPO growth?\nDavid Obstler: We don't release that. We're just making comments on the fact that, it was higher than the pro forma billing due to longer contract commitment duration in two and three year deals, but we haven't really commented and broken that up publicly.\nBrad Zelnick: Okay, thanks for taking my questions, Dave.\nDavid Obstler: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMatt Hedberg: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I'll echo the strong results this quarter. Your ability to sell two or more products is obviously impressive. I'm wondering if you can share maybe some examples of how some of your largest G2K customers are adopting APM and logging. And in particular when they do, are you seeing these customers migrate off of other vendors' APM and logging solutions? Or are they often run in parallel for a while?\nOlivier Pomel: So we do have a number of G2K customers that are adopting APM and our logs. In all of those cases when we start, we don't actually replace whatever they were using on-prem because they're still using that. Their on-prem world is still separate from their cloud world which is the net new which is where we come in. So we typically land usually with two or more products and we grow in that footprint in the cloud. We're still in most of these cases very early in that growth because those customers are very early in their migration to the cloud which is where we solidify our footprint. And we basically set ourselves up to later -- much later offer standardization of the whole tool set on us as the majority of their footprint ends up being on the cloud. But we're still not there with most of these customers.\nMatt Hedberg: That's helpful. And then I just wanted to make sure I understood churn a little bit better Oli. You noted earlier that you're not being impacted by workforce reductions. But when we think of higher level churns embedded in your guidance is that assumption that some customers might go out of business on the smaller side? Or might we see some seat-based contraction inside of existing customers at some point?\nOlivier Pomel: So we don't sell per seat. So we don't -- there's no user-driven -- these are account-driven component to one billion. So that part doesn't affect us directly. What we might see is some effect from our customers contracting their infrastructure. But in most cases our customers actually have to keep that infrastructure up to serve their own customers. And there's a limit to what they can contract there. So that's not an effect we've seen so far. I think we don't exactly know where the churn is going to come from if it comes. It's a fair assumption that a number of small businesses are going to disappear. We also see some medium and large businesses that are affected and we'll need some form of help or bailout to survive. We're all aware of that. So some of that might happen. So we want to be cautious. We want to be cognizant of the fact that if the economy as a whole is affected some of it is going to ripple to us considering the fact that we have a very broad-based customer base.\nDavid Obstler: And this is David. Yes we said -- as we said in the comments that we do have some new logo accumulation and some lower retention rates implied in the guidance. We said we haven't really seen that materially yet, but we're trying to be prudent relative to what might happen in the world.\nMatt Hedberg: Well done. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. I realize the security SKU is brand new, but just if you can just give us any color initially back from the field? And I have just a quick follow-up after that.\nOlivier Pomel: Well we're actually very happy with the uptake there. It's we've had while the product was still in beta we had some customers that wanted to buy and they did buy and some customers that already adopted the product at scale. So that's very good. Now it's still super early both in terms of the -- what's inside the product all of the feature set the integration and everything else also very early in the way we make customers or go to market for it. So for now we should assume that there's going to be a lot more investment and going to take us a lot more time to get these new products to interesting scale.\nBrent Thill: And then just as a quick follow-up. Are you changing any of your hiring plans or product plans from here given everything that's gone on? Or are you still tracking to kind of original plan going into the year?\nOlivier Pomel: We're tracking mostly to original plan. We've made a few adjustments for areas where it didn't make sense to hire for example things around organizing local marketing events or office management. Obviously that's not -- that's less of a topic when we don't have an office and you can't meet people in real life. But for everything else we stick to the plan. And we have ambitious plans. And we think it's actually a great time to be hiring and a great time to be building up our team. The thing I warned about in the call earlier was that, it might take a bit longer for those investments to pay-off because the market might be a bit softer on the customer side. They might be more uncertainty. But we are \u2013 we think for us it's an opportunity to stand on the ground of our strong platform and the efficiency of our business.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Rebeck with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBrad Rebeck: Great. Thanks very much. David, when a customer comes to you and asks, as you said to chunk a payment up in smaller bite-size amounts, do you ask for anything in return, like a longer contract or anything along those lines? Thanks.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. Yeah. We try -- we have a discussion with the contract -- with the customer. And we try to extend contract or do something around products. So we do that. But we're also here to grow with our clients. And what we care about given, what we've seen is keeping our clients and having them, grow with us over time. So we have a discussion. But we try to extend contract or get something else.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. And I can comment on that. We're doing this on a case-by-case basis really. But we do it in the spirit of partnership with our customers. And that's what I mentioned in the call too, that we're co-investing not only in our product and our team. We're also investing in our customers. We're investing in relationships. We know some of them are going through a very difficult time. And we think there are some two-way partnerships to be built on that.\nBrad Rebeck: Excellent, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Majek with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nRobert Majek: Hi. Thanks and congrats on the strong results. Can you break out the vertical exposure of your customer base? And perhaps more specifically, what the contribution is from some of the more macro-sensitive sectors, including travel and entertainment? And I have one follow-up question.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Let me pull up my number. And call back.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. Let me -- while Oli's doing, you're that. Do you want me to go or...\nOlivier Pomel: Sure, yes. Go ahead.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. We said, we have 10% or less that are subject to -- that are in the most exposed which are travel hospitality, dining and those types. So, about a 10% exposure and we have exposures on the other side to some of the work-from-home, collaboration and food deliveries and others. So, we're pretty diversified. We've always said we have a diversified customer base. And our concentration is not above 10% in those, impacted industries.\nRobert Majek: Thanks guys. Just perhaps one more, you touched on it earlier in prior questions. But can you just give us some more qualitative insight, into your conversations with new potential customers, and the willingness of these customers to pursue new modern deployments, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment?\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. So actually, I can speak to that. So, so far these conversations are not any different. Obviously, there is some scrutiny on spending and cash outlays. In particular, everybody is careful about cash, in the face of uncertainty, which is why we discussed also some -- in some cases, different payment terms for some customers. But the conversation so far as I'm saying, we actually see an interesting effect where some customers in very affected industries will reach out now. Because they actually have time to invest and prepare for the future because they are less -- they have less to operate on a day-to-day basis. So we've seen some of that happen. It is anecdotal. There's not -- we can't tell that if any of that is actually going to come to fruition before the world's fast recovering. But we see some of that happening. In general, we're still early in the cycle still that, we don't really know if there's going to be -- if the impact will be really felt in Q2 and Q3 or not. But we've been careful, in the way we set guidance.\nRobert Majek: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nBhavan Suri: Hey guys. Can you hear me okay? Sorry.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes.\nBhavan Suri: Thank you and congratulations for a great quarter. I guess I wanted to touch quickly on some of the product stuff. You obviously talked a little bit about the new Security Monitoring product, last quarter. It's fairly early days for that product. You weren't charging for it at the time. But I'd love to understand. I think became it generally available towards April. Early traction early interest how is that playing out? And obviously security is a big part given remote access given everything else that's happening with COVID, just how that's going.\nOlivier Pomel: So far so good, we -- the customers that have been -- part of the beta are using it and some of them have actually turned to paying customers, so some of the beta users are turning to paying customers already. So we're happy with the traction. But again, there's a lot more that needs to happen there. One thing that's interesting to us is that, we've seen adoption from the -- both sides we were trying to bring together. We've seen adoption from dev and ops in one side, but also some security folks on the other side. So that's very interesting. And that's what we're shooting for. But again, still early, but a lot is going to happen to it. I'm sure we'll talk about it again in future calls.\nBhavan Suri: Okay. And then one quick question on the pricing environment. Obviously, given the conversation with Dynatrace and others AppDynamics, New Relic, et cetera. You view it as kind of the most attractive price point out there. How often would you say pricing is an important driver of the conversation especially in this environment? Like are people -- are customers really thinking about pricing right now? And is that something that comes up as a decision point right now? Would love to understand sort of what the sales guys are seeing in these conversations.\nOlivier Pomel : Yes. So in general, we -- the way we differentiate is through the integrated platform and the outcomes we give through our products and less so the pricing that we have. We do have a pricing model that disaggregate certain elements so that our customers can align the price they pay with the value they get, and especially when it comes to matching data and logs and things like that. I would say, we haven't seen any changes in that environment. The one thing that we think is might be an advantage is that we also -- we operate by starting small and growing with our customers. Our model is not predicated on very large multi-year upfront deals. And that's something that is attractive to customers especially in an environment where they're trying to manage cash.\nBhavan Suri: Yes. Obviously, that's an issue given cash constraints. But you obviously have small SMB exposure as you talked about today. It's interesting you haven't seen those conversations, but appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you very much, and congratulations on running such a tight ship over there. So Oli, you've been doing this for 20 years a little more. I would love to hear your thoughts on how you think this recession is different and maybe similar to 2008, 2009.\nOlivier Pomel: Pat, that's a hard question. Well, I think the one thing I remember from the previous one is that you don't really know where they're going until they're over. So that's why we've been prudent. Another thing that we wanted to communicate through this call is that we -- look our business is very healthy. We see growth. We -- from everything we can tell the drivers that made us successful so far are still there and everything is working. At the same time, we've been growing 80%, 85%, 87% now year-over-year. And for that to work you pretty much need every -- to fire on every single cylinder, right? Everything needs to come together. And this almost guarantee that not everything will come together in the end if part of the world is impacted by COVID. And we're trying to be cognizant of that.\nPat Walravens: Great. And then David if I can ask you one RPO growth has been sort of in the same ballpark as revenue the last couple of quarters 3% less in Q4, 5% less in Q1.\nDavid Obstler: Yes.\nPat Walravens: Is that a reasonable way for us to think about it going forward? Or should that diverge?\nDavid Obstler: Well, as I mentioned we've had extension of average contract. We've had a number of companies who we developed long-term partnerships with and they've wanted to -- and together commit out to the door three years. So I think that's going to depend much like on billings as to the timing of those contract renewals. And I think you'll see in some period that happened and in other periods not mainly because of individual contracts that are up for renewal during that period or extension.\nPat Walravens: Okay. Great. Thank you both very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is now open.\nJack Andrews: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in the call and congratulations on the results. I just want to ask about what trends you're seeing in terms of Network Performance Monitoring and Real User Monitoring. Do you see these as more displacement opportunities? Or are these greenfield markets? And I was also wondering if you -- how big do you think that the market opportunity is around this given perhaps a different pricing point than your core infrastructure and APM products?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So the strategy there is the same as with the rest of the product which is we start from cloud environment, which tend to be new. In most cases, our customers are using other products. In some cases, they did. But the vast majority of the cases is net new in cloud environment. And the way we charge for those products is also aligned with the rest of our pricing philosophy, which is -- it's charge per usage, while giving the control back to the customer so they can align the price they pay and the value they get.\nJack Andrews: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up. Are there any international trends that are worthwhile noting in terms of just specific regions pockets of areas of strength or just other changes that you're thinking about in terms of aligning resources in particular international regions?\nOlivier Pomel: No. I mean at this point, we see success -- some success in all regions even though some are fairly recent. Even when you think of impact of COVID, we've had -- I mean that's sort of everywhere, but we don't have any -- we don't have anything that makes us think that any region is going to behave very differently from the other at this point. I'll give you an example. We even closed some new logo deals with large enterprises in Italy, while the whole country was completely locked down. So there's no -- there's really no data point to tell us anything is going to be different in any part of the world today.\nJack Andrews: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: All right. Well thank you. In closing, I'd like to repeat that we are very pleased with the results for Q1. We continue to invest in our long-term opportunity and we believe we are very well positioned for it. In what has been an unprecedented time for all of us, I want to thank Datadog employees for their dedication and resilience. And of course, I want to thank our customers for their trust in supporting their businesses through a challenging time. Thank you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude your program and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thank you A.J. and thank you all for joining us today. Before reviewing the quarter, I'd like to take some time to address the situation we're all facing with the COVID pandemic and in particular our internal response to the crisis the ways in which the pandemic intersects with our business but also some of the data we've seen in March and April as well as our stance for the year and our perspective on the future. So, starting with our response. We communicated three objectives internally: first to keep our employees safe healthy and sane; second to be good citizens and members of our communities and contribute to our collective health and economic success; and last, but not least, to serve our customers level down innovation and be the best at what we do for challenging times as well as good. In keeping with those objectives, we have mandated work from home since March 12th. In addition to that we have allocated a grant to each of our employees to support their productivity and safety. And at three discretion employees could elect to donate all or a portion of their grant to charities that help with COVID relief. I'm very proud to say that this program has already resulted in $1 million of donations from our employees and reflects the generosity and our commitment to go through this crisis together with the communities in which we operate. I also have to say that I've been extremely impressed with Datadog employees' resilience, continued productivity, and innovation through this time. Our success in pivoting to operate remotely does demonstrate the advantage of being a digital-first cloud-based business. Regarding the way the pandemic may affect Datadog, there are a few important structural points to understand about our business. First, we have a very diverse customer base. We estimate that less than 10% of our ARR comes from categories most negatively impacted by COVID such as hospitality and travel airlines and in personal entertainment. On the other hand we also have exposure to categories that have experienced increasing traffic such as streaming media gaming food delivery e-commerce and collaboration. Second, we also have a great diversity of customer sizes. We have low concentration and approximately 75% of our ARR comes from customers that pay us $100,000 or more. Also less than 50% [Later changed by the Company to 15%] of our ARR comes from a long tail of small businesses. Third, we price according to our customers' infrastructure footprint and not per seat. So, our product usage is not directly affected by reductions in the workforce. Fourth our business model is low-friction land and expand and our platform is adopted bottom up. We often land fast and small as enterprises begin their cloud migration and then we frictionlessly expand from there as more workloads move to the cloud. This makes our sales effort less dependent on physical meetings and makes our model is extremely efficient and less reliant on larger front deals. Lastly, we are pure SaaS and require no professional services or hand-on-keyboard implementation. Now, turning to what we've seen in March and April. First of all, the COVID escalation happened late enough in the first quarter to not materially affect our financial results. Throughout the quarter, we saw consumption continue to increase across the platform and growth of the number of hosts, containers metrics traces and logs, for example, have remained consistent with historical trends. We started to see some negative effects in impacted industries such as travel, hospitality and airlines. But we've also seen substantially increased usage from other categories such as streaming media, gaming, food delivery and collaboration, as these customers scaled up their operations in this environment. We also saw a surge of usage and surge in accounts in March in response to COVID that we expect could be more transitory in nature and may normalize over time. In terms of new deals, we did have a strong end of the quarter with limited impact from COVID. As far as Q2 goals, our pipeline is robust and relatively consistent with prior quarters, but it is still too early to know the impact COVID could have on the road. Because of that and given the macro uncertainty, it is prudent to expect delay of some new cloud migration projects as well as some impact on churn. As David will discuss, the effect of COVID has been incorporated in our guidance. To close on the COVID dynamic, let's step back and look at our stance for the rest of the year and perspective on the future. While there is a lot more certainty across the industry and the broader economy in the very near term, we believe it is more important than ever for businesses to operate online, and that the trends of digital transformation and cloud migration remain very much intact over the long-term and may even be accelerated or amplified. We believe we are well positioned to be a primary beneficiary of this trend and continue to win in the market. And we also believe that the efficiency of our business, whether it is our unit economics or balance sheet, our ability to innovate will be an advantage in a difficult market. As such our plans remain clear. We are investing across the board. We're investing in the development of existing and new products including aggressive R&D recruiting targets and taking advantage of the opportunity to attract talent that would otherwise not be on the market. We're investing in the growth of our go-to-market team across segments and geographies. We're investing in our relationship with customers as some of them go through difficult times and it is more important than ever for them to operate digitally. And we're investing in our existing employees to keep them safe and sane through this crisis. To conclude on this point, I would say that while I can't promise for macro reasons that we'll see the same incredibly fast return on these investments as we have historically. We are very confident in the mid and long-term opportunity in front of us and in our strategic plan to live up to it. Now on to Q1, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter. Results were once again driven by broad-based strength across new logos and expansions as well as across customer segments and sales channels. To summarize Q1, revenue was $131 million, an increase of 87% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 960 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, which is an increase of 89% from last year. These customers generate approximately 75% of our ARR. We also continue to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $19 million and a tax payback that is still around a year or less. We ended the quarter with about 11,500 customers, which is about 40% growth from 8,200 last year, which means we added about 1,000 net new customers in the quarter, which was twice the number we added last year. And as in past quarters, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. From an R&D perspective, we continued a rapid pace of innovation. We recently announced the general availability of our Security Monitoring products to unify visibility across security dev and ops teams. As with all our products, it is available in the same integrated simple-to-use SaaS platform. We are pleased with the initial response to this product, and it has been the most demanded beta in company history. But I'll remind you that we are just beginning on the journey to break the silos between security dev and ops, and we plan for continued innovation in this category. Additionally, we recently crossed 400 out of the box integrations. And among a number of new and improved, I'd like to call out Tenable, Nessus and VMware Carbon Black, which support our new security use cases. Looking at product usage, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. As of the end of Q1, 63% of our customers were using two or more products, up from 58% in Q4 and 32% last year. In Q1, approximately 75% sorry of our new logos landed with two or more products. And our success in both landing and cross-selling our platform has resulted in the number of customers using two or more products nearly tripling year-over-year. We are very pleased with this continued adoption of our platform, which includes strong initial uptake of our newest products, Network Performance Monitoring and Real User Monitoring. And as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to believe we have a significant opportunity to further expand our product portfolio and grow our addressable market. Now, let's move on to the go-to-market. I have been personally very impressed with our continued productivity across teams during this time. Enterprise sales teams in particular, who are serving companies of more than 5,000 employees, have successfully adapted to selling by phone and video. And as you know, tradeshows and marketing events have been canceled or going virtual. So, we have been redeploying those investments into online advertising, webinars and other activities. Our own user conference Dash is going virtual likely in Q3. Now, let's review some of our key wins in the quarter. First, we had an exciting seven-figure new logo win from a Fortune 100 pharmaceutical company, embarking on a migration to a container-based hybrid cloud. The incumbent legacy tools didn't keep up with their new dynamic stack and Datadog allows for mass adoption across DevOps and executive teams through a single observability platform that all teams can use every day. Next we signed a six-figure new logo deal to provide monitoring for a large health insurance company, embarking on a multi-cloud migration. What's really interesting about this deal is that it was won through a new partnership with one of the world's largest system integrators. This is a great example of success after we announced Datadog Partner Network in January, though, of course, it is still early days for our channel and alliances go-to-market. By the way, both of the new logo deals I just mentioned were closed at the very end of March. Next we had a sizable upsell to a mid-market on-demand logistics company which now spends more than $1 million a year with us. This company has been a customer since 2018, started with infrastructure monitoring and then adopted both APM and log management in 2019. Today this customer is also using Synthetics, NPM and Security Monitoring. What's really interesting in this case is that this customer partnered with us to build out security products and has quickly found value in scanning logs to detect security threats. It is also worth noting that this logistics company has experienced dramatically increased demand with COVID and it has successfully scaled up its operations, avoided performance issues and enabled all its engineers to collaborate remotely all with support from Datadog. Lastly, I'd note a large six-figure upsell to one of the world's largest global financial institutions. This customer plans to migrate thousands of applications over the coming years, with Datadog being the standard across multiple public and private clouds. This is an interesting customer to single out for both its extremely stringent security requirements and its adoption of our serverless monitoring capabilities. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler. David? So I'll answer that. So far, what we see in March, April is that, we see growth. April actually is a robust month. And we -- some customers are impacted and are going slower. Some customers have been scaling up. We have some questions on our end as we discussed on the call on which parts of the scale-ups are going to normalize in the future since we've seen some customers that scrambled late in Q1 and then in April to reorganize the operations and may normalize after that. I would say it's too early to tell where everything nets up. I would think, we need to be prudent in estimating what could happen over the next couple of quarters. But so far from what we can see, we see a lot more reliance on online. We see actually a success story around the cloud. The cloud scaled up. All these companies have been able to move their operations and scale their operations. And we see more investment going on that side. So that's the story so far. And you had a second question? Yes. So we -- look we already have a lot on our hands, right? So I should just restate the fact that our more recent products like APM and logs are in hyper growth. The products we've added after that like Synthetics for example are growing very fast. And there's still a lot of investment that goes into all of these products including our core infrastructure monitoring product. So we still have a lot that we're doing there. When it comes to security, we're still very, very early. What we have is the first product. We're happy that it is in GA. We're happy that it's getting traction. But it's still very early and it has a very long road map. And there's a lot more that we intend to build around it. So now regarding the categories of product you've mentioned like there definitely are some things that are interesting to us in there. And we do have some internal developments in a number of areas. I can't tell you exactly when that is going to be presented to customers and we really have a lot going on. Thank you. Yes. So, I mean -- look we see what's happening with our customers that have one foot in the digital world and one foot in the -- I would say physical brick-and-mortar world. They're investing heavily in digital art and they see these parts scaling like crazy right now. So that is not going to slow down. And that is actually going to we think accelerate the transformation for the broader industry. Now, at the same time this is happening it is difficult for companies to transform and modernize and make big investments or new investments at a time where many of them are in trouble and have pretty stern constraints on cash and have to make some very hard choices in the short term. So this is -- this is not new. Many other companies have discussed that before over the past few weeks. But I think what we're trying to balance here is, the uncertainty in the short term as these companies go past this urgent transformation or urgent survival mode and the fact that the underlying trend that underpin our success of digital transformation and move to the cloud are just going to accelerate and become more prevalent once the world starts recovering. So the balancing act, it would end up in the guidance we've given basically. This is definitely \u2013 like this was appealing to customers before COVID. It's as appealing if not more to customers now. Some customers might look into ways of rationalizing costs in the short term. So these are all opportunities. At this point none of these \u2013 we don't have data on any of these to be \u2013 to tell you whether it's going to be a big factor or not over the rest of the year. Look this is our strategy. We've been building towards that. So obviously in the long term we believe in it. Well the way we sell in general is always bottom up. Even in large enterprises even when we start the conversation at the CIO level and we end it to the CIO level, the adoption of the product is bottom up. And we start small. Even when we land \u2013 I mentioned earlier on the call like some six or seven figure land deal even when we land those deals these are still a small fraction of what the total opportunity looks like at these customers. And this represent bottom-up adoption and some deals that are going to grow significantly over time. So that's the way it used to work. That's still the way it's working as far as we can tell in Q2. Well, I mean look they're all growing. Infrastructure alone would be one of the best SaaS companies around APM and logs. So if we single out those products \u2013 and look we don't really like to do that because as we like to say there's quite a bit of fungibility between the different products and which you attribute to one you could attribute to another. But the \u2013 those products are in hyper growth. They're growing a lot faster than that or used to grow when we were at the scale-up of those products. And that's still the case. That growth hasn't slowed down. Synthetics is still growing much faster than we thought it would. And it's a great product for us. We're pleased with the initial uptake of NPM but it is still not material to our results. We mentioned it earlier but it's a product that has a higher friction than Synthetics for example to get adopted but it has a very long runway. So we're investing in that product. We've seen some adoption of RUM. We started charging in March for some portion of it. So we started charging for a part of it that is \u2013 part of our customers' contract is committed as opposed to being usage driven. So it's still also not material to Q1 but we should see more of it in Q2. And the security product we haven't started charging for yet in Q1 we started in Q2. So we don't have anything to say about it yet. Yes. I'll about SMB and maybe David can talk about the billing mix. So we actually \u2013 or ARR is as we discussed before is what split evenly between enterprise mid-market and SMB. But even within SMB we \u2013 most of that revenue comes from companies that are on the larger side and on very solid footing financially. Some of them are publicly traded and tend to be closer to the 1000-employee limit there. We mentioned on the call that less than 50% [Later changed by the Company to 15%] of our revenue came from companies that are on the smaller side which is less than 100 employees. If you look at our SMB customers, they're very diverse. And we're actually less exposed on the SMB side to some of the higher-risk categories around COVID. And so far we haven't seen a big change in trends. I mean, we did see a tiny uptick in churn in SMBs, but it's actually consistent with levels we've seen just a few quarters ago. So there's nothing out of the ordinary. And at the same time, we saw an increase of net retention for that same cohort of SMBs. So it has nothing conclusive there. We don't see anything that we didn't see before. Now when we try to guide for the future, we have to try and guess where our exposure is going to be and what can be weaker. We'll have to guess that the SMBs are going to feel more pain and are going to be where we'll see more churn. And so that's what we've incorporated in our guidance. David, do you want to take the billing mix? Yes. Yes. So, yeah. So look it's for the most part we're guessing because it's too early in the quarter to actually have a good sense of what may slip or not. At the end of Q1, we did have a few deals that slipped and that were marked. The reason for slippage was uncertainty around COVID. And several of them have closed right after. And I would say it's not like every quarter there are a few deals that slip. And the number of deals that slipped in Q1 was actually not out of the ordinary compared to previous quarters. So we don't have really anything to quantify the effects we might see but we do anticipate that we will see some. When it comes to usage, again, it's also a little bit more difficult to compare because some of the usage patterns have changed a little bit as companies have scrambled to reorganize. So there's a little bit less predictability in there, which is also why we're baking that into some of our guidance. So overall, look, we do anticipate some uncertainty and some pressure on some fronts in Q2 and Q3. I would be worried, if that didn't happen. But we don't have anything that makes us particularly concerned in front of us right now. David, do you want to add anything? So we do have a number of G2K customers that are adopting APM and our logs. In all of those cases when we start, we don't actually replace whatever they were using on-prem because they're still using that. Their on-prem world is still separate from their cloud world which is the net new which is where we come in. So we typically land usually with two or more products and we grow in that footprint in the cloud. We're still in most of these cases very early in that growth because those customers are very early in their migration to the cloud which is where we solidify our footprint. And we basically set ourselves up to later -- much later offer standardization of the whole tool set on us as the majority of their footprint ends up being on the cloud. But we're still not there with most of these customers. So we don't sell per seat. So we don't -- there's no user-driven -- these are account-driven component to one billion. So that part doesn't affect us directly. What we might see is some effect from our customers contracting their infrastructure. But in most cases our customers actually have to keep that infrastructure up to serve their own customers. And there's a limit to what they can contract there. So that's not an effect we've seen so far. I think we don't exactly know where the churn is going to come from if it comes. It's a fair assumption that a number of small businesses are going to disappear. We also see some medium and large businesses that are affected and we'll need some form of help or bailout to survive. We're all aware of that. So some of that might happen. So we want to be cautious. We want to be cognizant of the fact that if the economy as a whole is affected some of it is going to ripple to us considering the fact that we have a very broad-based customer base. Well we're actually very happy with the uptake there. It's we've had while the product was still in beta we had some customers that wanted to buy and they did buy and some customers that already adopted the product at scale. So that's very good. Now it's still super early both in terms of the -- what's inside the product all of the feature set the integration and everything else also very early in the way we make customers or go to market for it. So for now we should assume that there's going to be a lot more investment and going to take us a lot more time to get these new products to interesting scale. We're tracking mostly to original plan. We've made a few adjustments for areas where it didn't make sense to hire for example things around organizing local marketing events or office management. Obviously that's not -- that's less of a topic when we don't have an office and you can't meet people in real life. But for everything else we stick to the plan. And we have ambitious plans. And we think it's actually a great time to be hiring and a great time to be building up our team. The thing I warned about in the call earlier was that, it might take a bit longer for those investments to pay-off because the market might be a bit softer on the customer side. They might be more uncertainty. But we are \u2013 we think for us it's an opportunity to stand on the ground of our strong platform and the efficiency of our business. Yeah. And I can comment on that. We're doing this on a case-by-case basis really. But we do it in the spirit of partnership with our customers. And that's what I mentioned in the call too, that we're co-investing not only in our product and our team. We're also investing in our customers. We're investing in relationships. We know some of them are going through a very difficult time. And we think there are some two-way partnerships to be built on that. Yes. Let me pull up my number. And call back. Sure, yes. Go ahead. Yeah. So actually, I can speak to that. So, so far these conversations are not any different. Obviously, there is some scrutiny on spending and cash outlays. In particular, everybody is careful about cash, in the face of uncertainty, which is why we discussed also some -- in some cases, different payment terms for some customers. But the conversation so far as I'm saying, we actually see an interesting effect where some customers in very affected industries will reach out now. Because they actually have time to invest and prepare for the future because they are less -- they have less to operate on a day-to-day basis. So we've seen some of that happen. It is anecdotal. There's not -- we can't tell that if any of that is actually going to come to fruition before the world's fast recovering. But we see some of that happening. In general, we're still early in the cycle still that, we don't really know if there's going to be -- if the impact will be really felt in Q2 and Q3 or not. But we've been careful, in the way we set guidance. Yes. So far so good, we -- the customers that have been -- part of the beta are using it and some of them have actually turned to paying customers, so some of the beta users are turning to paying customers already. So we're happy with the traction. But again, there's a lot more that needs to happen there. One thing that's interesting to us is that, we've seen adoption from the -- both sides we were trying to bring together. We've seen adoption from dev and ops in one side, but also some security folks on the other side. So that's very interesting. And that's what we're shooting for. But again, still early, but a lot is going to happen to it. I'm sure we'll talk about it again in future calls. Yes. So in general, we -- the way we differentiate is through the integrated platform and the outcomes we give through our products and less so the pricing that we have. We do have a pricing model that disaggregate certain elements so that our customers can align the price they pay with the value they get, and especially when it comes to matching data and logs and things like that. I would say, we haven't seen any changes in that environment. The one thing that we think is might be an advantage is that we also -- we operate by starting small and growing with our customers. Our model is not predicated on very large multi-year upfront deals. And that's something that is attractive to customers especially in an environment where they're trying to manage cash. Pat, that's a hard question. Well, I think the one thing I remember from the previous one is that you don't really know where they're going until they're over. So that's why we've been prudent. Another thing that we wanted to communicate through this call is that we -- look our business is very healthy. We see growth. We -- from everything we can tell the drivers that made us successful so far are still there and everything is working. At the same time, we've been growing 80%, 85%, 87% now year-over-year. And for that to work you pretty much need every -- to fire on every single cylinder, right? Everything needs to come together. And this almost guarantee that not everything will come together in the end if part of the world is impacted by COVID. And we're trying to be cognizant of that. Yes. So the strategy there is the same as with the rest of the product which is we start from cloud environment, which tend to be new. In most cases, our customers are using other products. In some cases, they did. But the vast majority of the cases is net new in cloud environment. And the way we charge for those products is also aligned with the rest of our pricing philosophy, which is -- it's charge per usage, while giving the control back to the customer so they can align the price they pay and the value they get. No. I mean at this point, we see success -- some success in all regions even though some are fairly recent. Even when you think of impact of COVID, we've had -- I mean that's sort of everywhere, but we don't have any -- we don't have anything that makes us think that any region is going to behave very differently from the other at this point. I'll give you an example. We even closed some new logo deals with large enterprises in Italy, while the whole country was completely locked down. So there's no -- there's really no data point to tell us anything is going to be different in any part of the world today. All right. Well thank you. In closing, I'd like to repeat that we are very pleased with the results for Q1. We continue to invest in our long-term opportunity and we believe we are very well positioned for it. In what has been an unprecedented time for all of us, I want to thank Datadog employees for their dedication and resilience. And of course, I want to thank our customers for their trust in supporting their businesses through a challenging time. Thank you all."

            "name": "David Obstler",
            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. As mentioned, we were very pleased with our first quarter results. I will now review Q1 results in detail. Revenue was $131.2 million, up 87% year-over-year. The quarter's strength was broad-based, driven by new and existing customers, success across segments and sales channels, as well as driven by continued platform adoption. To provide some more context. First, in Q1, we saw strong new logo additions with contributions across sales channels and regions. Additionally, we saw strong continued expansion of existing customers. In the first quarter, our dollar-based net retention rate was above 130% for the 11th consecutive quarter. Our robust retention rate is driven primarily by increased usage of existing products, as well as cross-selling to newer products. As Olivier mentioned, we are pleased with the initial uptake of our newest solutions NPM and RUM. However, I would note that these newest products were immaterial to the results of the first quarter. Lastly, we saw strength across segments, with similar growth rates across enterprise, mid-market and SMB. We were encouraged to see this broad-based strength, including many large enterprise deals which closed in March, as well as strength from our SMB customer base. In the quarter, we saw continued robust dollar rates -- net and gross retention in each of these segments. Now turning to billings, which was $137.9 million and up 55% year-over-year. There are two dynamics here I'd like to call out. First, while we saw billings duration come in a bit in some of our renewals and upsells in the quarter, as some of our clients move to quarterly or semiannual payment terms from prior annual terms, I want to note that this did not result in reduced duration of contract length, merely the payment terms. This was due to customers' cash flow planning amid COVID and our accommodation to their billing preferences. The impact of shorter duration on the quarter was approximately $10 million to billings. Given our very efficient land-and-expand model, however, we are still not dependent on large upfront payments for multi-year deals. Next, there was a smaller impact from the invoice timing of a sizable existing customer, that was invoiced $4 million in Q1 last year and then due to growth was invoiced a second time in 2019, but was not invoiced in Q1 this year. Normalizing for these two impacts, calculated billings growth would have been approximately 70% year-over-year. In addition, as of the end of Q1, our Remaining Performance Obligations or RPO was $256 million and grew 82% year-over-year. RPO measures commitments rather than billing terms. The higher growth of RPO indicates increases in longer-term commitments even when billing terms may be altered. As discussed previously, we discourage the use of billings as a gauge of our momentum as it does not accurately portray the growth of our business. Revenue is a better indicator of growth given that our revenue is directly tied to consumption and due to the tight relationship between revenue and ARR. Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $105.2 million representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and 73% in the year ago period. Improvement in gross margin was driven by efficient use of our cloud hosting. As we said before, our gross margins may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter within an acceptable range as we prioritize product development and innovation as well as the build-out of cloud data centers in newer geographies. R&D expense was $35 million or 27% of revenue compared to 31% in the year ago quarter. We have continued to invest significantly in R&D including high growth in our engineering headcount. However, the growth of revenue has outpaced even our substantial investments. We continue to see meaningful opportunity to innovate and expand our platform and therefore plan to continue making meaningful investments in R&D. Sales and marketing expense was $42.1 million or 32% of revenues compared to 42% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but the pace of revenue growth has also outpaced this investment. While we have experienced cancellation of marketing events due to COVID, we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead generation activities, but not quite on a one-for-one basis. G&A expense was $12 million in the quarter or 9% of revenue slightly lower than 10% in the year ago period. Operating income was $16.1 million with a 12% operating margin compared to an operating loss of $7 million or a negative 10% margin in the year ago period. Beyond the improvement in gross margin and the other factors discussed above, I'd also like -- I'd also note that reduction in T&E and facilities overhead related to COVID contributed slightly to the operating margin improvement. Net income in the quarter was $18.8 million or $0.06 per share based on 328 million weighted average diluted shares. We have a highly efficient business model and experienced a high return on our investments in sales and marketing and R&D. While we have delivered three consecutive quarters of breakeven to positive operating income, we note that our priority remains top-line growth. And we intend to continue aggressive investments in R&D and go-to-market. We have been very successful in interviewing hiring and onboarding remotely. As a result, our plans for hiring and investing remain largely the same as before the corona outbreak. We are investing across the board and believe we are well-positioned to execute on our plans of growth. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $799 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was a positive $24.3 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software free cash flow was a positive $19.3 million in the quarter or a free cash flow margin of 15%. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2020. Given our recurring revenue model, we have not yet felt the effect of COVID-19 on our top line results. It is early in the quarter and we expect that we will see some deal slippage particularly in new logos. We also expect that despite a relatively high net retention rate, we may see some downward pressure in net retention rate in the next two quarters. As Olivier mentioned, the usage of some client surged in March and have adjusted somewhat in April, but remain above pre-COVID levels. It is too soon to know how usage will trend for the remainder of the quarter. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to expect some impact from the above effects most likely in Q2 and Q3 and potentially throughout the rest of the year given our ratable model. And as a result, we have incorporated this into our guidance. Beginning with our second quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be in the range of $134 million to $136 million which represents a year-over-year growth of 62% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of a loss of $1 million to income of $1 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be breakeven to $0.01 positive per share based on approximately 329 million weighted average diluted shares. Turning to the full year. Given our first quarter strength and the drivers of our business, we feel comfortable raising our guidance for 2020 based on what we know today about COVID-19 and the macroeconomic environment. For the full year 2020, revenue is expected to be in the range of $525 million to $565 million, sorry, $555 million to $565 million, which represents a 54% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of breakeven to $10 million positive. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.02 positive to $0.06 positive per share based on 330 million weighted average shares outstanding. A few things to take into account in our guidance, while we do not guide to billings and continue to discourage this as a key metric when putting together your models, we would note that the shorter billing duration impact we talked about in Q1 is likely to continue for the next couple of quarters as customers plan for cash flow amid COVID-19, related to cost drivers, while we've seen continued improvement in our gross margins, we are running towards the top of our long-term target. As we prioritize product development and diversifying our cloud hosting vendors and regions, our gross margins may fluctuate within a range of acceptability. Next, our intention is to invest meaningfully and continue to do so in R&D and sales and marketing. As noted, we have been successful in hiring and on-boarding during COVID. In Q2, we expect an approximately $5.5 million non-cash tax adjustment related to the expiration of a payroll tax liability. Similar to Q2 2019 this will be a benefit to GAAP operating income, but we intend to normalize for it in our non-GAAP results. And, therefore, it is neutral to non-GAAP operating income. Then some notes below operating income. We expect approximately $2 million of interest income per quarter throughout 2020 based on our cash and investments. Next, we do not expect to be a federal taxpayer but have a tax provision related to our international entity. For the full year, we expect a tax provision of a range of $700,000 to $1.5 million. Note that our share forecast for Q2 and the full year are diluted, given that we expect to be a non-GAAP net income profitable company for both periods. Lastly, while we're not giving guidance to cash flow a few things to note. Related to our employee stock purchase program, we've realized an inflow of about $3 million in cash flow from operations in both Q4 and Q1. As the first program concludes, there is a change in geography, whereby, cash flow from operations will decline by $6 million and cash flow from financing activities will increase by $6 million, resulting in no net cash effect. In addition, our new ESPP will produce $2 million to $3 million of new positive cash flow from operations in Q2. Lastly, we expect pressure on billings duration and potentially on DSOs related to COVID, which may cause lower cash generation in the near-term. Given our efficient model, proven cash flow generation, and meaningful cash on the balance sheet this will have no impact on our liquidity. To summarize we were very pleased with the business performance in the first quarter. We continue to deliver growth at scale a few can match and have demonstrated efficiency in our model. While we recognize the challenges that COVID-19 and the macro environment may present, we continue to believe that we are well-positioned for the long-term and plan for continued investments to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator let's begin the Q&A. Sterling I think the trends have really continued. The net retentions were very consistent in Q1 to what they had been and also the contribution from usage and new products and cross-sell. So much of what we've been saying in the last two quarters has continued in Q1 with really strong contribution to net retention from both those effects of usage and cross-sell. Yes. And in billing two-thirds of our \u2013 of ARR is associated with annual commitments or greater. And three-quarters, when you add in the usage related to that so three-quarters of our billings are associated with annual commitments or longer. What we said before was, our average length of commitment went out slightly in the quarter resulting in an acceleration of RPO. And our average period of billing duration came in a little bit more resulting in the billings discussion. But about three-quarters are related to annual commitments or more. Do you want to go first Oli and I'll weigh in? Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Our pipeline remains consistent. We don't know as Oli said is \u2013 what is the harvesting percentage what's going to happen this quarter. So we think that our model given our model of land and expand and usage that were less dependent than other models on going to land in a large three-year deal, but we don't know in new logos particularly what's going to happen as the quarter progresses. The main request we've gotten so far has been some modest can you chunk our builds up a little bit. That's been probably what we've seen a little more. But again, it hasn't been a significant percentage of our ARR either at this point. We don't release that. We're just making comments on the fact that, it was higher than the pro forma billing due to longer contract commitment duration in two and three year deals, but we haven't really commented and broken that up publicly. You're welcome. And this is David. Yes we said -- as we said in the comments that we do have some new logo accumulation and some lower retention rates implied in the guidance. We said we haven't really seen that materially yet, but we're trying to be prudent relative to what might happen in the world. Yeah. Yeah. We try -- we have a discussion with the contract -- with the customer. And we try to extend contract or do something around products. So we do that. But we're also here to grow with our clients. And what we care about given, what we've seen is keeping our clients and having them, grow with us over time. So we have a discussion. But we try to extend contract or get something else. Yeah. Let me -- while Oli's doing, you're that. Do you want me to go or... Yeah. We said, we have 10% or less that are subject to -- that are in the most exposed which are travel hospitality, dining and those types. So, about a 10% exposure and we have exposures on the other side to some of the work-from-home, collaboration and food deliveries and others. So, we're pretty diversified. We've always said we have a diversified customer base. And our concentration is not above 10% in those, impacted industries. Yes. Well, as I mentioned we've had extension of average contract. We've had a number of companies who we developed long-term partnerships with and they've wanted to -- and together commit out to the door three years. So I think that's going to depend much like on billings as to the timing of those contract renewals. And I think you'll see in some period that happened and in other periods not mainly because of individual contracts that are up for renewal during that period or extension."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our performance in Q4, where we showed high growth at scale, as well as strong business efficiencies. Looking back at 2021, not only do we continue to see a very strong demand environment, we also kept innovating at a rapid pace. And our team executed extremely well to help our customers manage complexity in the COVID era. Let's start with a quick scenario of Q4. Revenue was $326 million, an increase of 84% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 18,800 customers up from about 14,200 at the end of last year. We ended the quarter with about 2,010 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,228 at the end of last year. These customers generated about 83% of our ARR. We had 216 customers with ARR of $1 million or more, which was more than double the 101 we had at the end of last year. The leverage and efficiency of our business model is coming through with free cash of $107 million. And our dollar-based net retention rates continued to be over 130% as customers increase our usage and adopted our newer products. At a high level, positive business trends from recent quarters, continued in Q4. Business growth from existing customers exceeded our expectation this quarter, and we saw strong growth across all the products in our platform in all business segments. We had record new logo ARR in Q4, including some large new enterprise wins. And churn remains low and in line with historical rates. All these factors together led to another record quarter of ARR added. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 78% of customers were using two or more products, up from 72% a year ago, 33% of customers were using four or more products, up from 22% a year ago and as a sign of further adoption of our platform, we saw that 10% of our customers were using six or more products, which is up from 3% last year. We saw strong growth across our platform in Q4. Year-over-year growth of infrastructure monitoring ARR has accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3. In addition to that, APM suite and logo management products continue to be in hyper-growth mode. And we're very pleased to report that our newer products added about $100 million in ARR in 2021. These are the newer products we launched in 2019, which excludes core infrastructure, core APM and log management. Now let's move on to product and R&D, where our teams have not been slowing down and delivered another strong quarter of innovation. We announced the general availability of Sensitive Data Scanner in December. Sensitive Data Scanner gives customers an easy and cost-effective method to discover, classify and protect sensitive information. With modern applications, data moves across many important teams, making it difficult to know when services are storing sensitive data. This is particularly important for enterprises in regulated industries like health care or financial services. Sensitive Data Scanner is available today for log management, and we will be working to extend it into other areas of the platform in 2022. We also announced this morning the acquisition of CoScreen, a screen-sharing platform that allows participants to interact with a joint work space in real time. Engineering is a team sport. CoScreen lets us bring individual work into a shared team environment. And unlike general purpose video conferencing tools, which are one-to-many and focus on presentation and conversation, CoScreen is many-to-many, allowing multiple participants to share and collaborate in each other's windows as if they were local applications. We believe this will help our customers in a number of use cases such as incident response and alliance with our funding goal of breaking down silos between teams. Now let's take a moment to review our accomplishments in 2021. We ended the year with thirteen generally available products, up from nine at the end of 2020. We significantly extended our visibility capabilities in 2021. In infrastructure monitoring, we made it even easier to instrument and monitor. We launched over 80 new integrations covering clouds, CDNs, web platforms, automation platforms and more. We now have over 500 integrations and continue to go deeper into cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure and GCP. We launched network device monitoring for physical network devices and appliances, we created new container center views as our customers continue adopting [indiscernible] at massive scale. On the serverless front, we have expanded our coverage to include visibility into not only the functions customers develop, but also the ecosystem of data, security and routing services that surround them. And we launched a beta of universal service monitoring, which captures service level health and performance without needing to modify any application code. Our APM suite was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant in 2021, and we doubled down on innovation in APM. We expanded release and we\u2019re monitoring meaningfully, particularly for Android and iOS mobile devices. We launched session replay, database monitoring and automated tracking of faulty deployment. We expanded Synthetic Monitoring with support of numerous new browsers and locations. In Continuous Profiler, we added support to provide many new languages such as .NET, Ruby, PHP, CC++ and NodeJS. And we invested to get close with developers\u2019 day-to-day experience with synthetic testing in CI pipelines, now detecting problems before they happen in production, they are tracking no covering front-end devices and back-end services. And source code integration enabling developers to type production to the right line of code. In Lab Management, we continue to aggressively invest, providing more sophisticated analytical and governance capabilities and giving our customers more flexibility with data storage and retention. Our improvements unlock many sophisticated use cases, for example, in cybersecurity and business analysis. We also announced Online Archives, a new long-term data store for extremely large data volumes. Now further extending obtainability to development workflows, we launched CI Visibility to help developers ship faster and more safely. And going beyond observability, we launched our Cloud Security Platform, including Cloud Team, Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud Workload Security. In addition to those, our application security product is currently in beta. And we're now very pleased with our early momentum in security as we have thousands of customers using our cloud security products today. We also kept opening up Datadog as a platform with the release of Datadog apps. And finally, we'll continue to invest and innovate with Watchdog, Datadog's AI engine. Watchdog automatically detect and correlate anamolies, and we've been busy extending Watchdog to provide information in context throughout our platform. I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their hard work and their focus on our customers. Now moving on to sales and marketing. Earlier this month, we announced the promotion of Sean Walters to Chief Revenue Officer. This is a well-deserved promotion for Sean, who has been an enterprise sales leader at Datadog for four years now and has shown excellence in building strong teams and delivering high productivity. We've all been impressed with his performance over the past few quarters as well. Sean has a deep experience in the field with over 20 years of increasing responsibilities in software sales, and we are excited to see him build on his successes as CRO. In addition to this, we are pleased to have received a FedRAMP moderate authorization. As a result, we can now sell to U.S. Federal Government agencies as well as the other public sector customers who use FedRAMP as an indicator of compliance and security. We have been working to build our go-to-market teams for the public sector, and we intend to expand on those efforts aggressively. We also announced a global strategic partnership with AWS. This is a recognition of our success and growth with AWS and our commitment to further invest to accelerate our joint opportunities. Among the areas of further partnership, we have already integrated Datadog more tightly into the AWS marketplace. We are also working with AWS to build deeper integrations not only for observability, but also for security use cases, and we are also planning to extend our joint go-to-market activities. Meanwhile, our sales teams continue to execute at a very high level.  So, let's discuss some wins for Q4. First, we had a six-year land deal with a major U.S. airline. This customer has chosen Datadog as the de facto monitoring solution for all new IT projects and applications. They plan to start with six products in the Datadog platform with an expectation to expand significantly with more teams and applications over time. Next, we had a seven-figure up-sell with a major European car company. Prior to using Datadog, this customer has five disparate monitoring tools, which created focus alerts while leaving gaps in coverage. With Datadog, they were able to break down silos between teams and reduce the frequency and duration of outages. Next, we had an up-sell to [indiscernible] ARR with a major financial infrastructure company. This customer has consolidated multiple monitoring tools in Datadog, helping them ensure stability and support growth. This customer estimate savings of 2.5% [ph] by migrating to Datadog. And the up-sell also includes new products such as Cloud Team, Cloud Workload Security and Cloud Security Posture Management. And this customer now uses 10 Datadog products. Next, we have seven-figure up-sell with a multinational, beverage conglomerate. This expansion makes Datadog their global observability standards with enterprise adoption across six international zones. Thanks to Datadog Correlation, what used to take three people an hour of data gathering, now it takes one person less than ten minutes. And finally, we wanted to spend some time discussing our largest-ever, multimillion dollar land deal with a major media company. This media conglomerate sees massive amounts of traffic with this customer-facing content. And the most critical content such as live sports and entertainment requires highly optimized observability. This customer also decided to embark upon a significant digital transformation project, eliminating its data centers over time in favor of cloud. This operational overhaul hinged on proper end-to-end observability. But the customers' existing monitoring solutions failed to innovate quickly enough to support this growth and increasing complexity. In addition, reliance in open-source tooling was a strain on engineering resources. Datadog provided a single integrity cloud solution, and the customer planned to replace eight different commercial and open-source tools with a Datadog platform, starting with five of our products. So, as you can see, our go-to-market teams are successfully helping both new and existing customers get value at Datadog. And I want to congratulate them for their incredible work this quarter. Now looking ahead to 2022 and beyond, we continue to see digital transformation and cloud migration as critical for our existing and prospective customers. The cloud and other next-gen technologies are creating complexity that customers need to understand and manage. Meanwhile, security threats can occur anywhere in this broad and dynamic set of infrastructure and applications, making identifying vulnerability and attacks absolutely crucial. So, there's a lot of demand out there for observability and security for [indiscernible]. As a result, we continue to feel that we are still very early with respect to our products and our market opportunity. And looking forward to 2022, we will make further progress in expanding the Datadog platform. We have a lot to do, and we're excited about what's in front of us. On a final note, we feel that 2021 was a very successful year for Datadog, which we recognize, and it's been a tough time for many others. This is why we're happy to report that together with our employees, Datadog dedicated over $3 million to nonprofit global organizations at the end of the year, and we look forward to giving back more to our communities in 2022. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of financial performance and guidance. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q4 and fiscal year 2021. Revenue was $326 million, up 84% year-over-year and up 21% quarter-over-quarter. Usage growth with our existing customers exceeded our expectations. Customers are finding value from adopting more products on our platform. And new logo ARR grew robustly in Q4. Let's go into some more of the details. First, growth of existing customers was strong in Q4. And our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 18th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was very strong. Our customers expanded the usage of our largest products meaningfully. Infrastructure monitoring year-over-year ARR growth accelerated from Q3 levels. And the APM suite and log management products remain in hyper-growth mode. And our newer products are all growing very rapidly. We also saw strong ARR growth in each geographical region. North America, EMEA and APAC all accelerated on a year-over-year basis compared to Q3. Our go-to-market teams delivered a strong quarter in new logos and new logo ARR. We added 1,300 customers sequentially, a new record for us. And new logo ARR was also a record and included our largest ARR land ever, as Olivier discussed earlier. Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue. Our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 78% of our customers using two or more products, 33% using four or more products and 10% on using six or more Datadog products as of the end of Q4. Finally, churn has remained low. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has gradually improved over the years and is now in the mid- to high-90s, and it's similar across customer segments and major products. Turning to billings, billings were $408 million, up 86% year-over-year. Billings duration in Q4 were similar to the year ago quarter and within the range we've seen historically. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $815 million, up 88% year-over-year. And contract duration was similar to the year ago quarter. Current RPO growth was over 80% year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review the income statement. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $262 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and also 78% in the year ago quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we saw efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold in the quarter. In the medium- to long-term, we continue to expect gross margin to remain in the high-70s range. Operating income was $71 million or a 22% operating margin compared to an operating income of $18 million with a 10% margin in the year ago quarter. We are experiencing significant business efficiencies on strong revenue growth. This is occurring despite continued, aggressive investments in our long-term opportunities, particularly in R&D and go-to-market. Finally, in Q4, we hosted our DASH User Conference virtually and had a strong presence at AWS Reinvent. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. And cash flow from operations was a strong $116 million in the quarter. After taking into account \u2013 taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $107 million with a free cash flow margin of 33%. I want to briefly summarize our fiscal 2021 results. Revenue was $1.03 billion, up 70% year-over-year. We generated $165 million positive in operating income for a 16% operating margin compared to $64 billion with an 11% operating margin in 2020. And we generated $251 million in free cash flow at a 24% margin in 2021 compared to $83 million at a 14% margin in 2020. I want to thank all Datadog employees for their hard work and strong execution throughout 2021. Now for our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2022, we continue to believe we are in early days of our opportunity in observability. And we are at the very beginning of our potential in-cloud security and developer-focused observability. At 18,800 customers, we believe we are still very early in our penetration of potential customers worldwide, and we see opportunities broadly across industries and customer sizes. As we look on to 2022, we believe companies have learned to manage around the potential business disruptions and remote work life over the past couple of years. And we believe that the need for companies to embark upon digital transformation and cloud migration projects is higher than ever and our strategic imperative to drive competitive advantage. So, we are initiating our fiscal 2022 guidance, which includes continued high growth. With our usual conservatism applied, our outlook is as follows. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $334 million to $339 million, which represents 70% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $36 million to $41 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.10 to $0.12 range per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion, which represents 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $180 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.51 per share at approximately 350 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And now some notes on the guidance. As usual, when providing guidance, we use more conservative assumptions than we have seen in our historical results. Our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for our long-term growth. Next, our model assumes greater expenses related to travel and in-person events going forward, but we remain flexible depending on further COVID developments, and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees. Finally, as it relates to our capital expenditures, we are catching up on office build-outs and expect CapEx as a percent of sales to roughly double compared to 2021. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in Q4 and 2021. We continue to innovate rapidly and broaden our platform capabilities with many more products planned to be launched in 2022. We have grown our go-to-market opportunities, including in the public sector with our FedRAMP Moderate Authorization and deepening our relationships with our cloud partners. And across the company, we are working hard to execute against our opportunities in 2022 and beyond. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q& A.\nQ - Raimo Lenschow: Thank you. Raimo Lenschow, my name. Congratulations. I think it was an amazing quarter. Olivier, you mentioned a higher usage in this quarter. What's driving that? Is that just kind of people standardizing? Is it just traffic as the clients getting better, because that's kind of in a very, very strong number? What are the factors there? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: I don't think there's one specific factor that's driving it. I think it's a combination of everyone's digital transformation, cloud migration still happening. And happening with the, I would say, the historical rate we've seen through the history of the company. That plus us covering more and more surface with those customers having more product that they can adopt they can grow into. And so that's what we thought through the quarter. We did see \u2013 like this is a Q4, right, so we did see the same compression at the end of the quarter as we see every year. It was also a bit more pronounced like it was last year. We've seen them to be a bit more pronounced in a post-COVID world. But overall, the quarter was very, very strong and definitely stronger than last year.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. And then one follow-up on that one. You talked about some of the very big wins and how they are consolidating on you. Do you see that consolidation about more in-house build tooling and open-source tools? Or is it also consolidating like some of the kind of more established competitors in the space, in the kind of upper APM load areas, et cetera?\nOlivier Pomel: It's a mix of both. Really, it follows the distribution of tooling out there. Like whatever customers have is what they end up consolidating on us. And this movement, we're still early in this consolidation movement. We see it happen, I would say, maybe a bit more often than we used to. I mean we're mentioning a couple in every earnings call at this point with the large ones are fairly notable. But we expect to see more of that in the future, but not necessarily right away.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Congratulations. Well done.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much, what a superb quarter, Olivier. I'm curious to get your thoughts on a couple of things. One is as the product suite broadens out, how are you thinking about distribution? Are you going to have more specialized distribution attacking, say, the DevOps market for the app market in your core markets in APM and monitoring? And I have a follow-up question. Thank you so much.\nOlivier Pomel: The answer is, we're open to whatever we work. We still haven't made any changes to the way we distribute. We still have one sales force that sells everything. We still land largely with infrastructure and the expand from there. And we actually see some proof points that we can get some very good wins that way. I mean I think we mentioned on the call the fact that one of our very large customers in finance adopted our security suites. And that was done with our standard land-and-expand motion. So, we see that working in at least some cases. That being said, as we fully mature newer product, especially the security product, we might have to have to get some go to market, but we're not there yet.\nKash Rangan: Got it. And second and final one, thank you so much for that. As you look at the consumption model, when trends are improving, obviously, those revenue outcomes can be as impressive as the ones that you have. As you've become a larger company, are you contemplating things to minimize the volatility of these results and have a little bit more predictability on the other positive side? And that would mean like a snowflake gives concessions to its customers as they keep making technology improvements, they pass back some of these savings to alleviate any potential pushback as you become a more strategic vendor? Oh my god, I'm spending those so much. It is of great value, but at the same time, can you elaborate a little bit on how you can think ahead and anticipate some of the things that can get underway? That's it for me, thank you so much and congrats.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So, the way we deal with that is \u2013 and again, the backdrop there is the explosion of data volumes. So, if data volume at our customers grow a lot faster than the top line, at some point, you can't grow what you charge for that linearly with the data volume. The way we deal with that is, we give them more and more options. And those options are differentiated technologically at least so that we can keep developing new ways of storing the data, different types of data in different ways for different periods of time and let customers choose what they want to use out of that. So that's what we're doing with Online Archives, for example, which is \u2013 which we announced last year and which is going great this year. That's also why we invested in \u2013 we're investing in the ability pipeline. So, there's a number of things we're doing to help put customers in control and make sure that what we deliver always, always aligns with the \u2013 what we charge always aligns with the value customers get.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and my congrats on exceptional 2021. Olivier, I wanted to talk a little bit about your comment about the early days of the opportunity on sort of two-dimensions. If I look at some of the big software companies that we've seen, whether it's Salesforce or VMware or other large companies, they have north of hundreds of thousands of customers, right? And you're sort of sitting at 18,000. I was wondering in terms of your guys' vision, do you envision Datadog getting to the sort of customer account levels? That's sort of part one of the question. On the other hand, it seems like you guys are doing better and better up-market at despite this largest stuff or land and win with this media company. Do you start to feel that the large enterprise market is now moving more and more towards the sort of Datadog platform versus kind of this sort of hybrid cloud approach that they've been at, sort of mobility that they bid in for the last couple of years? Any sort of views on traction in enterprise and what sort of customer comes can get to longer-term?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So, on the first question, we definitely \u2013 we build a product and a company that serves the whole market, like the whole gamut of potential customers. We think that developers at small companies behave, especially in the cloud, they behave very much the same way as developers in very large enterprises. They have the same toolbox. They work the same way largely. And so, we built a product that service everyone. We do expect to have very large counts of customers in the end. But to your second question, we also see, right now, a lot of the demand, a lot of the growth is coming from mid-market and larger enterprises and also the higher end of the market. And we feel good about that part of the market, like we see it successfully standardize on Datadog. We see it successfully land-and-expand with us. I think we're growing faster. Well, I would say we're an equivalent size and growing faster than anybody else in the market for that specific part of the market. So, I think we feel good about it. That's a big part of what we're doing.\nSanjit Singh: That makes a ton of sense. And I guess my follow-up question relates to security. I understand that's still early days in the move into this area. I wondered if you could talk about it in sort of two-pieces. One, selling security solutions to your core set of users, how confident are you that you're going to see traction in that motion sooner versus maybe selling securities solutions to operations team, which might require more of an investment, more of a specialized go-to-market motion? If you can sort of \u2013 how do we think through traction on sort of part one of that selling to like Datadog users versus the big operations?\nOlivier Pomel: So, the traction is here. We see the traction, right? So, we mentioned on the call, we have thousands of customers on security products. And so, the adoption is there. It's happening. It's happening across our products. We have a number of products we started charging for in Q4, such as Cloud Workload Protection, for example. And those actually are off to a strong start. So, we are pretty impressed with the numbers we see there. So again, it's too early to pass judgment. We have to see them perform for a couple of quarters. We have to see what\u2019s working, what's not working as customers get multiple quarters into the adoption of the product. But the size we see today are very positive in terms of the adoption, in terms of the fit of those products, in terms of the way our story makes sense for our customers. It's still possible we have to make changes to the go-to-market motion and specialize the teams and do a number of other things. I would say it might come in a bit later when customers are \u2013 start embarking on the same standardization motion for security as they do right now with us for observability. But today, we're very pleased with what we see in terms of the fit and the adoption of those product. This is happening according to plan, I would say. So, we're very happy.\nSanjit Singh: Very encouraging. Thank you, Olivier.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: Thanks. Hi, guys. Maybe we'll switch over to the margin side. So, David, in particular, I was impressed by your sales and marketing spend increased less this year quarter-over-quarter than it did last year, but the revenue incremental dollars that you added was much higher. Can you kind of go through, is that all just because of the usage based in existing customer contribution in the quarter?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. That's because of the usage and the cross-sell and the efficiency of it in our frictionless adoption. So, it's an indication of both the robotics and the end market as well as the ability for clients to adopt more of the platform.\nSterling Auty: Got it. And then maybe one quick follow-up. Same thing on gross margins, it was a very big sequential bump. What's contributing to it? And is it durable at these levels? Or what should we be contemplating in terms of that trend?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. And as we said since we went public that we are focusing on gross margins in the mid-70% to touching 80%. And that there will be periods of time that due to investment, they will tend towards to the middle or lower part of that range and then go up. And in this case, in this period of time, we were able to harvest efficiencies in our cloud costs. And like in other periods of the fluctuation of the gross margin, we've hit 80%. As we're investing, we may dip below that. But as we said in my prepared remarks, we feel confident that will remain in the mid-to-upper parts of the 70% range.\nOlivier Pomel: As a reminder, we're shipping a cloud cost management product next year, and we hope to be the first case study for that.\nSterling Auty: Understood, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Fatima Boolani from Citi.\nFatima Boolani: Good morning, thank you for taking my question. Olivier, maybe I'll start with you. You've been very conservative with respect to some of your commentary around the traction you're seeing outside of your core wheelhouse of observability in the realm of CICD and real catering to the developer audience. So maybe just to take a step back with 13 generally available products, what are some of the efforts that are being put in place to package certain modules that are in a similar family or address a similar buyer persona? And sort of where are you on that journey to be able to attract more and more of these different groups within the enterprise organization? And then I have a follow-up for David, if I may.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So, we're actually very happy with those products. So, they're getting to market nicely. So, the CICD product also started charging for fairly recently, and we're very happy with the adoption we see there, similarly to what we said about security. At some point, we'll also comment on the numbers for that. I would say the numbers are still small compared to the rest of the business. But that's small due to the fact that the rest of the business is well north of $1 billion in ARR and growing close to 100% or over 100% of it focused on positive year-over-year. So, it's going to take more time for it to be meaningful compared to all that. But we do see a lot of potential in those products. We are very happy with the adoption. In terms of the packaging, we always ask ourselves the right way to price and package those products. With big signs of unbundling for \u2013 because it does align the very precisely what customers pay with the value they get, and it gives us very strong signal on what works and what doesn't work at the product level. So, we always start with unbundled. And then over time, we might find that there are something that might need to be packaged differently or customers that want to buy together that's when we start bundling things. But that's we always start with bundle, that's a default motion for us.\nFatima Boolani: I appreciate that detail, Olivier. David, for you, I think you were pretty categorical in your prepared remarks vis-\u00e0-vis your guidance philosophy. But taking a step back and in the context of the $1 million deal volume that you saw double this year, how are you contemplating the incidence, frequency and maybe volume of larger deals as you do start seeing some more repeatability and patterns in the way customers are moving to the seven, eight figure deal mark? Any help or context as to how you're thinking about those attributing \u2026.\nDavid Obstler: Yes. Thank you. It's still the similar motion to what we've been experiencing, which means, for the most part, our $100,000-plus customers were started out lower than the $100,000, and our $1 million customers started lower than $1 million. We're still largely the land-and-expand. So, we see that motion continuing. And in addition to that, I think as we said in our prepared remarks, we're seeing, in some cases, where a client has a significant cloud presence and consolidates or outsources or goes to a system rather than open source, we would land and get to a large amount earlier, which we've talked about in some of our prepared comments. But for the most part, it still is that land and expand and evolve from lower deal sizes to the $100, 000 and $1 million as we've been discussing.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Olivier, on 2022 cloud migrations, there's been some concern given the consumption that we've seen in the last two years that there could be some slowdown or digestion. It doesn't appear that, that's what you're seeing right now. But curious if you could just share your thoughts on what happens this year? And it seems like there's some really new pockets of movement even in financial services and other subsectors that we haven't seen. What are you expecting? And David, if I can follow-up with you, just on a quick question about Sean's new role. Historically, we've seen changes in the sales team. In other software companies, we've seen a little bit of an air pocket. It seems like you expect that this to proceed smoothly, and it's more of a tweaking of the go-to-market versus a major change. Can you comment on that as well? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Sure. Yes. So, in terms of the sort of the trends we've seen, we're forecasting, from what we can tell, there's no \u2013 like what we see is continuity. Like what we see in 2021, if you look at it including 2021, it \u2013 to us, it looks a lot like 2019, which itself looks a lot like 2018. And what this tells you is we're still early in the transformation and cloud migration. And this is happening \u2013 it seems to be happening with a certain rate within enterprises that we take convert workloads and move them to the cloud. And we've seen that to be more or less throughout the history of the company. So, from where we stand, we don't see any particular acceleration in 2021 that is \u2013 it would be a pull-forward of 2022 or anything like that. So, we see continuity. That's what we see. So, we see a strong demand environment. Really, we can't forecast what's going to happen next year. It's possible that we're still in troubled times, and it's possible where things happen. But we're very confident that if that's the case, the setbacks will be temporary and that we're still very early in a very, very broad transformation, the managers of which we know is still difficult to reason about. So that's on your first question. So, we're very confident on the environment and very confident in our place in it. In terms of the sales team, we actually didn't make a very large synergies to the sales team. We acted with continuity, and we promoted from within for our CRO spot. We promoted Sean, who I think is the best person for the job really. And we don't expect any big changes as part of that. We expect to keep building. We expect to keep scaling. We expect to be a little bit of go-to-market in some areas with the new products to the fold. But mostly, we're here to scale what we have today.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Rebeck from Stifel.\nBrad Rebeck: Great. Thanks very much. Olivier, last quarter you talked about some recent product releases that could be easily consumed by non-IT employees; so, I'm just wondering how that's trending? And then as we look forward, should we think about that as a driver to 2022 or more 2023 and beyond? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So, we have a few of those products, and we mentioned some of the products that reach more into the business areas of support area, like Session Replay, Analysis, things like that, Cloud Cost Management. There are some that are still not in GA. The others are still very early. We ship them late last year. So, I would say it's definitely too early to share any data about them. 2022, there's still probably going to be too small to have a major impact on the numbers, but that's definitely a big area for growth for us in the future. So, we invest now we to those products and then they make a meaningful contribution in the future. And by the way, that's what we've seen happen with our other products today. I think we mentioned on the call that the \"those smaller products\" that we released since 2019 collectively added more than $100 million in ARR last year, which is very meaningful. And so, we expect the same to happen with the products we released last year.\nBrad Rebeck: That's great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Turits with Keybanc.\nMichael Turits: Hey Olivier and everybody, congrats on the quarter. I want to ask the competitive question, particularly important given that you had two public comps that have less impressive results. So very specifically, where are you winning up market? And how are you winning up-market competitively in enterprise and also maybe downmarket where you may be seeing more price competition on ingest?\nOlivier Pomel: So first of all, we don't actually see the competition all that much. So, I don't wake up every morning asking myself; how are we going to win or whether we are winning. We mostly compete against customers building it themselves or being on the tool and starting in the cloud without idea what's going on. We do see a few big replacements in every quarter. We've mentioned a few on the call. When that's the case, we \u2013 I mean the ones we mentioned are typically the ones that are up market. The reason why we're winning those situations is we offer an integrated platforms where others don't. We're cloud native and others aren't. And most importantly, we have a lot more usage and adoption from the teams on the ground around our product. So that's the deploy what we are used by everyone saying that I repeat that every call, that really is what makes us win in the end with customers, and that applies up market, that applies down market, it applies everywhere.\nDavid Obstler: And let me just add that, of course, we didn't have the APM and logs. We didn't have the breadth of the platform five years ago. So, as we talked about there, a number of customers where we had landed with infrastructure and as they are consolidating on the platform, they're buying our products, whether it be enhancement, whether it be movement from open source or whether it be replacement of the company's products that you're talking about.\nMichael Turits: And David, on the packaging of different products or different personas, what about from a sales and go-to-market perspective? Any moves to either create specialized or overlay sales forces given the breadth and scope of what you're now offering?\nOlivier Pomel: Not yet. Right now, we're experimenting with a few things, obviously like we're trying to see if it can makes sense in some areas, the prime candidate being security. But we haven't made any big changes to the way we sell. And we also see some interesting proof points that we can be successful with keeping the way the \u2013 keeping our sales team the way it is right now. So, we are key on that. We expect it to be an area of focus at some point during the next year, but so far, no changes and so far, looking good.\nMichael Turits: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Hey, thanks guys. Hey, Oli, it was great to see you achieving better at moderate status. Could you remind us about the success you've had thus far on the federal side? And could that drive additional success there in 2022?\nOlivier Pomel: The goal is really to be able to sell to fully go to market on the federal side. With the FedRAMP low we had before, we were limited in the number of agencies we could target, and we also are limited a number of use cases. We basically could only target in past monitoring use cases. We couldn't send logs, APM, things like that. With certain medium what we can do is we can sell all of our products, and we can pretty much sell to every single civilian agency in the Federal Government as well as a number of other government agencies that are local agencies, but that take the same or use FedRAMP as same guidelines for security and compliance. So, it really opens up the market. We've seen some \u2013 already some success to date. We already have, as of last quarter, $1 million-plus customer on the federal side on our FedRAMP on our [indiscernible] offer. So, we're optimistic, but we still have a lot of building to do on the go-to-market there, like it's not necessarily exactly the same go-to-market that we used to.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. And then maybe just a quick one on the product side. It was really excited to see a Sensitive Data Scanner launch. It really feels like data governance as a whole is just becoming more important in a post-COVID world. It sounds like it's working today with application logs. Could that product go further? I'm just sort of curious on sort of what the scope of what Datadog provide from a governance \u2013 data governance perspective?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So that product is actually a great example of the power of our platform in all the various use cases we can derive from it. We started the Sensitive Data Scanner with log data, which is very straightforward and something customers love because it tells them immediately whether they are manipulating sensitive data or they should not, which is a hard problem for them to sell. But we can extend it to look at all of the data that ends up on the front end of an application to reuse monitoring. We can extend it to look at all of the data that go through the various services in the back end of the application through the APM. We can extend it to look at all of the data to go through the network through network monitoring. So, it's a great example of who we can use the data collection we already have to help our customers solve hard problems that they couldn't solve otherwise. It's also interesting because it's a product that is pretty much halfway between observability and security. And you could make a good case for attaching to one or the other. So, it really shows like the unified future observability and security platform that we're building.\nMatt Hedberg: Super helpful. Congrats on the results, guys.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Tindle from Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks, good morning. Olivier, I just wanted to start with a big picture question. You crossed the $1 billion in ARR threshold this year, a very strong year. That tends to be a milestone where software companies can start thinking about updates to either internal infrastructure or team to take them beyond that $1 billion level. So maybe you could just talk conceptually about how you're thinking about what to put in place to scale Datadog to a multibillion-dollar company?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, that's what we do every week. We ask our sales, how are going to keep scaling the company, what we're missing, what we need to add. So, in general, we are scaling company. We're hiring a lot. We're hiring at all levels. We're bringing outside experience where we don't have it. But I would say, in addition to that we're also very, very, very careful to make sure we can keep delivering and keep innovating. I mean we have worked at much larger companies before. I've seen how hard it can be to get things done in a very large organization. And I want to make sure that we keep our teams extremely productive. We minimized the number of redtape that prevent them for getting any work done while putting \u2013 building enough roads and enough controls, so we make sure that nothing will happen. So that's the concern every single week for us at Datadog, and that's pretty much what my job is.\nAdam Tindle: Understand. Maybe a more near-term follow-up for David on guidance. This time last year, you were guiding to high 30s year-over-year growth for 2021. You obviously overachieved that, but now we're sitting here guiding to high-40s year-over-year in 2022 on a bigger base number. Just wondering how you thought about the process to putting a target out now versus this time last year in 2021. It seems bold, but you talked about usual conservatism. So maybe take us through that? Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, yes. I think \u2013 yes, thanks. I think overall, it's sort of the same ideology, which is to take what we've seen in the usage and numbers and discount it. I will say last year being in COVID, we took and we said this on the call, a bit more of a conservative approach. We had less \u2013 we had more uncertainty last year. So, I mean I think we adopted the same approach but applied a little more conservatism last year when we gave our original guidance.\nAdam Tindle: That's helpful. Thanks, and congrats again.\nDavid Obstler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you. My congratulations. Olivier, you released Cloud SIEM about 18 months ago, and it seemed to get off to a slower start than the typical new Datadog product. But as you mentioned, you now have thousands of customers that have deployed your security product. So, what I'm wondering is what's the primary driver of this? Is it a function of having more breadth in security, such as sensitive data scanner, cloud workload protection, et cetera? Is it because your sales force and channel has become more adept at selling security? Or is it something else you would point to?\nOlivier Pomel: So first of all, actually, it's off to a very strong start. So, we mentioned thousands of customers using it. That's a lot of customers, especially for a product that is an expansion product. That's not something that we lead with typically. So, we're very happy with that. There's still quite a bit of product work happening on it. Like we're growing it so we can support more use cases, so it can be more end-to-end for everything our customers need to do with the cloud so there's quite a bit of investment on that product that remains. So, we're still early in the product development cycle there. We expect at some point, maybe this year to share some numbers on the revenues by those products, but we're also very happy with the growth there. And those products are growing very, very quickly, obviously from a much smaller base than the rest or products. But we mentioned $100 million of added revenue from the added ARR from the newer product. And the two bigger buckets in there are user experience monitoring and security. So, we see that growing, and we see that being a potential driver of future growth for us.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. That's very helpful. And then regarding the new global partnership with AWS or expanded partnership, can you elaborate on how much tighter the product integration may become? And then also how actively are the two companies planning to engage in collaborative go-to-market?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, so it's very much a continuation of what we're doing with [indiscernible]. I think we've written down a few things that were more implicit before in terms of what we're going to do from an integration perspective. What's exciting to us is that we've written down things that are \u2013 that don't just concern observability, but also reach into security use cases. So, we're going to see broader integrations there between the two products. And we've also decided to get a little bit closer on some of on go to market. There's not much more I can say on that. We're still working on a number of those things. But this is, I would say, in line with what we're doing with other partners to really fully go to market with the cloud provider's customers.\nGregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Yun Kim from Loop Capital Markets.\nYun Kim: Hey, guys. First, super congrats on a strong quarter. Your growth is accelerating and you're already at a scale that's much larger than our competition. Obviously, you can keep hiring at the current rate to support growth. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in regards to sales productivity improvement? And is it natural for you to just focus on larger deals to just keep driving higher sales productivity gains?\nOlivier Pomel: So first of all, our growth is not completely predicated on sales productivity because we have a largely frictionless model. So, the \u2013 part of our growth is, but part is not, which is why you see the revenue growth outpace the sales and marketing growth or expenses growth by a wide margin. Our focus for the year is more on scaling the team than on increasing productivity because productivity is very, very high. If you look at the cost of sale, like we're probably the best, if not close to the best in the market. So, our goal is to keep scaling the team and keep getting the product set, so we can keep getting more of the same economies of scope that we already see with our customers.\nYun Kim: Great. And then just a quick question for David. Can you just, at a high level, talk about level of visibility you have and how that has trended over the past year? You mentioned that revenue recognition could lag the actual signing of the deals. As you sign larger deals, are you seeing increasing revenue visibility? Or some of the new deals and expansion deals take a bit longer to ramp as the deployment size gets larger?\nDavid Obstler: We have very consistent performance on our cohorts across the different types of customers, the way they adopt the product and ramp. And that applies to larger deals as well as smaller. So, we have pretty good visibility, pretty good time series. There hasn't been a change in that pattern of adoption and we monitor that all the time as we look at increasing our ability to predict the revenue. We also, I think are in some cases looking at developing a functionality in account management to help our clients adopt faster. And that is sort of around the edges, but we have a pretty good idea of how our clients are adopting.\nYun Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Cikos from Needham & Company.\nMike Cikos: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question here. The first, just coming back to the profitability guidance that we have for Q1 and for fiscal 2022 now; for David, I know that you had discussed, I guess, the expectation that we would see some of these travel and in-person events kind of feather back in. I have to imagine that there's some incremental cost with these acquisitions that you guys have announced. Can you help, I guess, fine-tooth that a little bit for us as far as what what's expected and how that's expected to come into the year?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. In our guidance we have assumed a resumption of normal T&E and marketing events. We said previously that sort of in the 3% to 4% range. We estimate we've had cost savings due to lower-than-average T&E and marketing events. So, we've incorporated that in the guidance. We'll have to see how quickly that resumes. As we said, first priority is safety of our employees. But we've incorporated that. We've also, as we said have very aggressive hiring plans and we've incorporated that in. But as we said previously, we think the number is sort of on average around three plus in terms of COVID savings relative to T&E and marketing events as a percentage of revenues.\nMike Cikos: Great. Thank you for that. And then just, I guess, a two-part question here, but more housekeeping. The first, I know in previous quarters, and maybe I missed it on this call here, but you guys have discussed how new logo lands are typically coming in with two-plus products 70% to 75% of the time. So, first question would be, is that still the case? And then the second question, I know that you're talking about gross retention now improving to the mid- to high-90s range. It had been mid-90s. I think before that, it was mid- to low-90s. So, can you just help us think of what are the investments or what is it you guys are doing to drive those gross retention rates up over time? And congratulations on that effort as well.\nDavid Obstler: Thank you. On the first question, yes, the land percentage of more than one product remains similar to what we said previously, in the 70s. No change in that motion. In terms of the gross retention, with the platform expanding and the standardization, one, we see some more stickiness. And as we always have, we're focusing on both account management, technical account management, working with our clients over a long term which we've done and continue to do. Oli?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. And to close on that, I mean, we deliver a great product that's a must have for our customers that has extremely high adoption and usage across our customer base, that delivers great value for them. And we know it delivers great value. We're not surprised by anything because we have this unbundling approach that lets us really quickly understand that what customers pay for is basically part of our platform and will be expected out of it. So that's what makes the gross retention stay up and go up over time.\nMike Cikos: Terrific. Thank you very much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over \u2013 back over to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: All right. Thank you. Thank you all. In closing, I'll just repeat that we are very, very pleased with our performance this quarter. And I also want to thank all Datadogs around the world for their hard work in 2021. I know they're excited for in 2022 and so am I. So, thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes [indiscernible] thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our performance in Q4, where we showed high growth at scale, as well as strong business efficiencies. Looking back at 2021, not only do we continue to see a very strong demand environment, we also kept innovating at a rapid pace. And our team executed extremely well to help our customers manage complexity in the COVID era. Let's start with a quick scenario of Q4. Revenue was $326 million, an increase of 84% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 18,800 customers up from about 14,200 at the end of last year. We ended the quarter with about 2,010 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,228 at the end of last year. These customers generated about 83% of our ARR. We had 216 customers with ARR of $1 million or more, which was more than double the 101 we had at the end of last year. The leverage and efficiency of our business model is coming through with free cash of $107 million. And our dollar-based net retention rates continued to be over 130% as customers increase our usage and adopted our newer products. At a high level, positive business trends from recent quarters, continued in Q4. Business growth from existing customers exceeded our expectation this quarter, and we saw strong growth across all the products in our platform in all business segments. We had record new logo ARR in Q4, including some large new enterprise wins. And churn remains low and in line with historical rates. All these factors together led to another record quarter of ARR added. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 78% of customers were using two or more products, up from 72% a year ago, 33% of customers were using four or more products, up from 22% a year ago and as a sign of further adoption of our platform, we saw that 10% of our customers were using six or more products, which is up from 3% last year. We saw strong growth across our platform in Q4. Year-over-year growth of infrastructure monitoring ARR has accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3. In addition to that, APM suite and logo management products continue to be in hyper-growth mode. And we're very pleased to report that our newer products added about $100 million in ARR in 2021. These are the newer products we launched in 2019, which excludes core infrastructure, core APM and log management. Now let's move on to product and R&D, where our teams have not been slowing down and delivered another strong quarter of innovation. We announced the general availability of Sensitive Data Scanner in December. Sensitive Data Scanner gives customers an easy and cost-effective method to discover, classify and protect sensitive information. With modern applications, data moves across many important teams, making it difficult to know when services are storing sensitive data. This is particularly important for enterprises in regulated industries like health care or financial services. Sensitive Data Scanner is available today for log management, and we will be working to extend it into other areas of the platform in 2022. We also announced this morning the acquisition of CoScreen, a screen-sharing platform that allows participants to interact with a joint work space in real time. Engineering is a team sport. CoScreen lets us bring individual work into a shared team environment. And unlike general purpose video conferencing tools, which are one-to-many and focus on presentation and conversation, CoScreen is many-to-many, allowing multiple participants to share and collaborate in each other's windows as if they were local applications. We believe this will help our customers in a number of use cases such as incident response and alliance with our funding goal of breaking down silos between teams. Now let's take a moment to review our accomplishments in 2021. We ended the year with thirteen generally available products, up from nine at the end of 2020. We significantly extended our visibility capabilities in 2021. In infrastructure monitoring, we made it even easier to instrument and monitor. We launched over 80 new integrations covering clouds, CDNs, web platforms, automation platforms and more. We now have over 500 integrations and continue to go deeper into cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure and GCP. We launched network device monitoring for physical network devices and appliances, we created new container center views as our customers continue adopting [indiscernible] at massive scale. On the serverless front, we have expanded our coverage to include visibility into not only the functions customers develop, but also the ecosystem of data, security and routing services that surround them. And we launched a beta of universal service monitoring, which captures service level health and performance without needing to modify any application code. Our APM suite was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant in 2021, and we doubled down on innovation in APM. We expanded release and we're monitoring meaningfully, particularly for Android and iOS mobile devices. We launched session replay, database monitoring and automated tracking of faulty deployment. We expanded Synthetic Monitoring with support of numerous new browsers and locations. In Continuous Profiler, we added support to provide many new languages such as .NET, Ruby, PHP, CC++ and NodeJS. And we invested to get close with developers' day-to-day experience with synthetic testing in CI pipelines, now detecting problems before they happen in production, they are tracking no covering front-end devices and back-end services. And source code integration enabling developers to type production to the right line of code. In Lab Management, we continue to aggressively invest, providing more sophisticated analytical and governance capabilities and giving our customers more flexibility with data storage and retention. Our improvements unlock many sophisticated use cases, for example, in cybersecurity and business analysis. We also announced Online Archives, a new long-term data store for extremely large data volumes. Now further extending obtainability to development workflows, we launched CI Visibility to help developers ship faster and more safely. And going beyond observability, we launched our Cloud Security Platform, including Cloud Team, Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud Workload Security. In addition to those, our application security product is currently in beta. And we're now very pleased with our early momentum in security as we have thousands of customers using our cloud security products today. We also kept opening up Datadog as a platform with the release of Datadog apps. And finally, we'll continue to invest and innovate with Watchdog, Datadog's AI engine. Watchdog automatically detect and correlate anamolies, and we've been busy extending Watchdog to provide information in context throughout our platform. I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their hard work and their focus on our customers. Now moving on to sales and marketing. Earlier this month, we announced the promotion of Sean Walters to Chief Revenue Officer. This is a well-deserved promotion for Sean, who has been an enterprise sales leader at Datadog for four years now and has shown excellence in building strong teams and delivering high productivity. We've all been impressed with his performance over the past few quarters as well. Sean has a deep experience in the field with over 20 years of increasing responsibilities in software sales, and we are excited to see him build on his successes as CRO. In addition to this, we are pleased to have received a FedRAMP moderate authorization. As a result, we can now sell to U.S. Federal Government agencies as well as the other public sector customers who use FedRAMP as an indicator of compliance and security. We have been working to build our go-to-market teams for the public sector, and we intend to expand on those efforts aggressively. We also announced a global strategic partnership with AWS. This is a recognition of our success and growth with AWS and our commitment to further invest to accelerate our joint opportunities. Among the areas of further partnership, we have already integrated Datadog more tightly into the AWS marketplace. We are also working with AWS to build deeper integrations not only for observability, but also for security use cases, and we are also planning to extend our joint go-to-market activities. Meanwhile, our sales teams continue to execute at a very high level.  So, let's discuss some wins for Q4. First, we had a six-year land deal with a major U.S. airline. This customer has chosen Datadog as the de facto monitoring solution for all new IT projects and applications. They plan to start with six products in the Datadog platform with an expectation to expand significantly with more teams and applications over time. Next, we had a seven-figure up-sell with a major European car company. Prior to using Datadog, this customer has five disparate monitoring tools, which created focus alerts while leaving gaps in coverage. With Datadog, they were able to break down silos between teams and reduce the frequency and duration of outages. Next, we had an up-sell to [indiscernible] ARR with a major financial infrastructure company. This customer has consolidated multiple monitoring tools in Datadog, helping them ensure stability and support growth. This customer estimate savings of 2.5% [ph] by migrating to Datadog. And the up-sell also includes new products such as Cloud Team, Cloud Workload Security and Cloud Security Posture Management. And this customer now uses 10 Datadog products. Next, we have seven-figure up-sell with a multinational, beverage conglomerate. This expansion makes Datadog their global observability standards with enterprise adoption across six international zones. Thanks to Datadog Correlation, what used to take three people an hour of data gathering, now it takes one person less than ten minutes. And finally, we wanted to spend some time discussing our largest-ever, multimillion dollar land deal with a major media company. This media conglomerate sees massive amounts of traffic with this customer-facing content. And the most critical content such as live sports and entertainment requires highly optimized observability. This customer also decided to embark upon a significant digital transformation project, eliminating its data centers over time in favor of cloud. This operational overhaul hinged on proper end-to-end observability. But the customers' existing monitoring solutions failed to innovate quickly enough to support this growth and increasing complexity. In addition, reliance in open-source tooling was a strain on engineering resources. Datadog provided a single integrity cloud solution, and the customer planned to replace eight different commercial and open-source tools with a Datadog platform, starting with five of our products. So, as you can see, our go-to-market teams are successfully helping both new and existing customers get value at Datadog. And I want to congratulate them for their incredible work this quarter. Now looking ahead to 2022 and beyond, we continue to see digital transformation and cloud migration as critical for our existing and prospective customers. The cloud and other next-gen technologies are creating complexity that customers need to understand and manage. Meanwhile, security threats can occur anywhere in this broad and dynamic set of infrastructure and applications, making identifying vulnerability and attacks absolutely crucial. So, there's a lot of demand out there for observability and security for [indiscernible]. As a result, we continue to feel that we are still very early with respect to our products and our market opportunity. And looking forward to 2022, we will make further progress in expanding the Datadog platform. We have a lot to do, and we're excited about what's in front of us. On a final note, we feel that 2021 was a very successful year for Datadog, which we recognize, and it's been a tough time for many others. This is why we're happy to report that together with our employees, Datadog dedicated over $3 million to nonprofit global organizations at the end of the year, and we look forward to giving back more to our communities in 2022. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of financial performance and guidance. David? I don't think there's one specific factor that's driving it. I think it's a combination of everyone's digital transformation, cloud migration still happening. And happening with the, I would say, the historical rate we've seen through the history of the company. That plus us covering more and more surface with those customers having more product that they can adopt they can grow into. And so that's what we thought through the quarter. We did see \u2013 like this is a Q4, right, so we did see the same compression at the end of the quarter as we see every year. It was also a bit more pronounced like it was last year. We've seen them to be a bit more pronounced in a post-COVID world. But overall, the quarter was very, very strong and definitely stronger than last year. It's a mix of both. Really, it follows the distribution of tooling out there. Like whatever customers have is what they end up consolidating on us. And this movement, we're still early in this consolidation movement. We see it happen, I would say, maybe a bit more often than we used to. I mean we're mentioning a couple in every earnings call at this point with the large ones are fairly notable. But we expect to see more of that in the future, but not necessarily right away. Thank you. The answer is, we're open to whatever we work. We still haven't made any changes to the way we distribute. We still have one sales force that sells everything. We still land largely with infrastructure and the expand from there. And we actually see some proof points that we can get some very good wins that way. I mean I think we mentioned on the call the fact that one of our very large customers in finance adopted our security suites. And that was done with our standard land-and-expand motion. So, we see that working in at least some cases. That being said, as we fully mature newer product, especially the security product, we might have to have to get some go to market, but we're not there yet. Yes. So, the way we deal with that is \u2013 and again, the backdrop there is the explosion of data volumes. So, if data volume at our customers grow a lot faster than the top line, at some point, you can't grow what you charge for that linearly with the data volume. The way we deal with that is, we give them more and more options. And those options are differentiated technologically at least so that we can keep developing new ways of storing the data, different types of data in different ways for different periods of time and let customers choose what they want to use out of that. So that's what we're doing with Online Archives, for example, which is \u2013 which we announced last year and which is going great this year. That's also why we invested in \u2013 we're investing in the ability pipeline. So, there's a number of things we're doing to help put customers in control and make sure that what we deliver always, always aligns with the \u2013 what we charge always aligns with the value customers get. Yes. So, on the first question, we definitely \u2013 we build a product and a company that serves the whole market, like the whole gamut of potential customers. We think that developers at small companies behave, especially in the cloud, they behave very much the same way as developers in very large enterprises. They have the same toolbox. They work the same way largely. And so, we built a product that service everyone. We do expect to have very large counts of customers in the end. But to your second question, we also see, right now, a lot of the demand, a lot of the growth is coming from mid-market and larger enterprises and also the higher end of the market. And we feel good about that part of the market, like we see it successfully standardize on Datadog. We see it successfully land-and-expand with us. I think we're growing faster. Well, I would say we're an equivalent size and growing faster than anybody else in the market for that specific part of the market. So, I think we feel good about it. That's a big part of what we're doing. So, the traction is here. We see the traction, right? So, we mentioned on the call, we have thousands of customers on security products. And so, the adoption is there. It's happening. It's happening across our products. We have a number of products we started charging for in Q4, such as Cloud Workload Protection, for example. And those actually are off to a strong start. So, we are pretty impressed with the numbers we see there. So again, it's too early to pass judgment. We have to see them perform for a couple of quarters. We have to see what's working, what's not working as customers get multiple quarters into the adoption of the product. But the size we see today are very positive in terms of the adoption, in terms of the fit of those products, in terms of the way our story makes sense for our customers. It's still possible we have to make changes to the go-to-market motion and specialize the teams and do a number of other things. I would say it might come in a bit later when customers are \u2013 start embarking on the same standardization motion for security as they do right now with us for observability. But today, we're very pleased with what we see in terms of the fit and the adoption of those product. This is happening according to plan, I would say. So, we're very happy. As a reminder, we're shipping a cloud cost management product next year, and we hope to be the first case study for that. Yes. So, we're actually very happy with those products. So, they're getting to market nicely. So, the CICD product also started charging for fairly recently, and we're very happy with the adoption we see there, similarly to what we said about security. At some point, we'll also comment on the numbers for that. I would say the numbers are still small compared to the rest of the business. But that's small due to the fact that the rest of the business is well north of $1 billion in ARR and growing close to 100% or over 100% of it focused on positive year-over-year. So, it's going to take more time for it to be meaningful compared to all that. But we do see a lot of potential in those products. We are very happy with the adoption. In terms of the packaging, we always ask ourselves the right way to price and package those products. With big signs of unbundling for \u2013 because it does align the very precisely what customers pay with the value they get, and it gives us very strong signal on what works and what doesn't work at the product level. So, we always start with unbundled. And then over time, we might find that there are something that might need to be packaged differently or customers that want to buy together that's when we start bundling things. But that's we always start with bundle, that's a default motion for us. Sure. Yes. So, in terms of the sort of the trends we've seen, we're forecasting, from what we can tell, there's no \u2013 like what we see is continuity. Like what we see in 2021, if you look at it including 2021, it \u2013 to us, it looks a lot like 2019, which itself looks a lot like 2018. And what this tells you is we're still early in the transformation and cloud migration. And this is happening \u2013 it seems to be happening with a certain rate within enterprises that we take convert workloads and move them to the cloud. And we've seen that to be more or less throughout the history of the company. So, from where we stand, we don't see any particular acceleration in 2021 that is \u2013 it would be a pull-forward of 2022 or anything like that. So, we see continuity. That's what we see. So, we see a strong demand environment. Really, we can't forecast what's going to happen next year. It's possible that we're still in troubled times, and it's possible where things happen. But we're very confident that if that's the case, the setbacks will be temporary and that we're still very early in a very, very broad transformation, the managers of which we know is still difficult to reason about. So that's on your first question. So, we're very confident on the environment and very confident in our place in it. In terms of the sales team, we actually didn't make a very large synergies to the sales team. We acted with continuity, and we promoted from within for our CRO spot. We promoted Sean, who I think is the best person for the job really. And we don't expect any big changes as part of that. We expect to keep building. We expect to keep scaling. We expect to be a little bit of go-to-market in some areas with the new products to the fold. But mostly, we're here to scale what we have today. Yes. So, we have a few of those products, and we mentioned some of the products that reach more into the business areas of support area, like Session Replay, Analysis, things like that, Cloud Cost Management. There are some that are still not in GA. The others are still very early. We ship them late last year. So, I would say it's definitely too early to share any data about them. 2022, there's still probably going to be too small to have a major impact on the numbers, but that's definitely a big area for growth for us in the future. So, we invest now we to those products and then they make a meaningful contribution in the future. And by the way, that's what we've seen happen with our other products today. I think we mentioned on the call that the \"those smaller products\" that we released since 2019 collectively added more than $100 million in ARR last year, which is very meaningful. And so, we expect the same to happen with the products we released last year. So first of all, we don't actually see the competition all that much. So, I don't wake up every morning asking myself; how are we going to win or whether we are winning. We mostly compete against customers building it themselves or being on the tool and starting in the cloud without idea what's going on. We do see a few big replacements in every quarter. We've mentioned a few on the call. When that's the case, we \u2013 I mean the ones we mentioned are typically the ones that are up market. The reason why we're winning those situations is we offer an integrated platforms where others don't. We're cloud native and others aren't. And most importantly, we have a lot more usage and adoption from the teams on the ground around our product. So that's the deploy what we are used by everyone saying that I repeat that every call, that really is what makes us win in the end with customers, and that applies up market, that applies down market, it applies everywhere. Not yet. Right now, we're experimenting with a few things, obviously like we're trying to see if it can makes sense in some areas, the prime candidate being security. But we haven't made any big changes to the way we sell. And we also see some interesting proof points that we can be successful with keeping the way the \u2013 keeping our sales team the way it is right now. So, we are key on that. We expect it to be an area of focus at some point during the next year, but so far, no changes and so far, looking good. The goal is really to be able to sell to fully go to market on the federal side. With the FedRAMP low we had before, we were limited in the number of agencies we could target, and we also are limited a number of use cases. We basically could only target in past monitoring use cases. We couldn't send logs, APM, things like that. With certain medium what we can do is we can sell all of our products, and we can pretty much sell to every single civilian agency in the Federal Government as well as a number of other government agencies that are local agencies, but that take the same or use FedRAMP as same guidelines for security and compliance. So, it really opens up the market. We've seen some \u2013 already some success to date. We already have, as of last quarter, $1 million-plus customer on the federal side on our FedRAMP on our [indiscernible] offer. So, we're optimistic, but we still have a lot of building to do on the go-to-market there, like it's not necessarily exactly the same go-to-market that we used to. Yes. So that product is actually a great example of the power of our platform in all the various use cases we can derive from it. We started the Sensitive Data Scanner with log data, which is very straightforward and something customers love because it tells them immediately whether they are manipulating sensitive data or they should not, which is a hard problem for them to sell. But we can extend it to look at all of the data that ends up on the front end of an application to reuse monitoring. We can extend it to look at all of the data that go through the various services in the back end of the application through the APM. We can extend it to look at all of the data to go through the network through network monitoring. So, it's a great example of who we can use the data collection we already have to help our customers solve hard problems that they couldn't solve otherwise. It's also interesting because it's a product that is pretty much halfway between observability and security. And you could make a good case for attaching to one or the other. So, it really shows like the unified future observability and security platform that we're building. Thank you. Well, that's what we do every week. We ask our sales, how are going to keep scaling the company, what we're missing, what we need to add. So, in general, we are scaling company. We're hiring a lot. We're hiring at all levels. We're bringing outside experience where we don't have it. But I would say, in addition to that we're also very, very, very careful to make sure we can keep delivering and keep innovating. I mean we have worked at much larger companies before. I've seen how hard it can be to get things done in a very large organization. And I want to make sure that we keep our teams extremely productive. We minimized the number of redtape that prevent them for getting any work done while putting \u2013 building enough roads and enough controls, so we make sure that nothing will happen. So that's the concern every single week for us at Datadog, and that's pretty much what my job is. So first of all, actually, it's off to a very strong start. So, we mentioned thousands of customers using it. That's a lot of customers, especially for a product that is an expansion product. That's not something that we lead with typically. So, we're very happy with that. There's still quite a bit of product work happening on it. Like we're growing it so we can support more use cases, so it can be more end-to-end for everything our customers need to do with the cloud so there's quite a bit of investment on that product that remains. So, we're still early in the product development cycle there. We expect at some point, maybe this year to share some numbers on the revenues by those products, but we're also very happy with the growth there. And those products are growing very, very quickly, obviously from a much smaller base than the rest or products. But we mentioned $100 million of added revenue from the added ARR from the newer product. And the two bigger buckets in there are user experience monitoring and security. So, we see that growing, and we see that being a potential driver of future growth for us. Well, so it's very much a continuation of what we're doing with [indiscernible]. I think we've written down a few things that were more implicit before in terms of what we're going to do from an integration perspective. What's exciting to us is that we've written down things that are \u2013 that don't just concern observability, but also reach into security use cases. So, we're going to see broader integrations there between the two products. And we've also decided to get a little bit closer on some of on go to market. There's not much more I can say on that. We're still working on a number of those things. But this is, I would say, in line with what we're doing with other partners to really fully go to market with the cloud provider's customers. So first of all, our growth is not completely predicated on sales productivity because we have a largely frictionless model. So, the \u2013 part of our growth is, but part is not, which is why you see the revenue growth outpace the sales and marketing growth or expenses growth by a wide margin. Our focus for the year is more on scaling the team than on increasing productivity because productivity is very, very high. If you look at the cost of sale, like we're probably the best, if not close to the best in the market. So, our goal is to keep scaling the team and keep getting the product set, so we can keep getting more of the same economies of scope that we already see with our customers. Yes. And to close on that, I mean, we deliver a great product that's a must have for our customers that has extremely high adoption and usage across our customer base, that delivers great value for them. And we know it delivers great value. We're not surprised by anything because we have this unbundling approach that lets us really quickly understand that what customers pay for is basically part of our platform and will be expected out of it. So that's what makes the gross retention stay up and go up over time. All right. Thank you. Thank you all. In closing, I'll just repeat that we are very, very pleased with our performance this quarter. And I also want to thank all Datadogs around the world for their hard work in 2021. I know they're excited for in 2022 and so am I. So, thank you all."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q4 and fiscal year 2021. Revenue was $326 million, up 84% year-over-year and up 21% quarter-over-quarter. Usage growth with our existing customers exceeded our expectations. Customers are finding value from adopting more products on our platform. And new logo ARR grew robustly in Q4. Let's go into some more of the details. First, growth of existing customers was strong in Q4. And our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 18th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was very strong. Our customers expanded the usage of our largest products meaningfully. Infrastructure monitoring year-over-year ARR growth accelerated from Q3 levels. And the APM suite and log management products remain in hyper-growth mode. And our newer products are all growing very rapidly. We also saw strong ARR growth in each geographical region. North America, EMEA and APAC all accelerated on a year-over-year basis compared to Q3. Our go-to-market teams delivered a strong quarter in new logos and new logo ARR. We added 1,300 customers sequentially, a new record for us. And new logo ARR was also a record and included our largest ARR land ever, as Olivier discussed earlier. Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue. Our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 78% of our customers using two or more products, 33% using four or more products and 10% on using six or more Datadog products as of the end of Q4. Finally, churn has remained low. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has gradually improved over the years and is now in the mid- to high-90s, and it's similar across customer segments and major products. Turning to billings, billings were $408 million, up 86% year-over-year. Billings duration in Q4 were similar to the year ago quarter and within the range we've seen historically. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $815 million, up 88% year-over-year. And contract duration was similar to the year ago quarter. Current RPO growth was over 80% year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review the income statement. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $262 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and also 78% in the year ago quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we saw efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold in the quarter. In the medium- to long-term, we continue to expect gross margin to remain in the high-70s range. Operating income was $71 million or a 22% operating margin compared to an operating income of $18 million with a 10% margin in the year ago quarter. We are experiencing significant business efficiencies on strong revenue growth. This is occurring despite continued, aggressive investments in our long-term opportunities, particularly in R&D and go-to-market. Finally, in Q4, we hosted our DASH User Conference virtually and had a strong presence at AWS Reinvent. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. And cash flow from operations was a strong $116 million in the quarter. After taking into account \u2013 taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $107 million with a free cash flow margin of 33%. I want to briefly summarize our fiscal 2021 results. Revenue was $1.03 billion, up 70% year-over-year. We generated $165 million positive in operating income for a 16% operating margin compared to $64 billion with an 11% operating margin in 2020. And we generated $251 million in free cash flow at a 24% margin in 2021 compared to $83 million at a 14% margin in 2020. I want to thank all Datadog employees for their hard work and strong execution throughout 2021. Now for our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2022, we continue to believe we are in early days of our opportunity in observability. And we are at the very beginning of our potential in-cloud security and developer-focused observability. At 18,800 customers, we believe we are still very early in our penetration of potential customers worldwide, and we see opportunities broadly across industries and customer sizes. As we look on to 2022, we believe companies have learned to manage around the potential business disruptions and remote work life over the past couple of years. And we believe that the need for companies to embark upon digital transformation and cloud migration projects is higher than ever and our strategic imperative to drive competitive advantage. So, we are initiating our fiscal 2022 guidance, which includes continued high growth. With our usual conservatism applied, our outlook is as follows. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $334 million to $339 million, which represents 70% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $36 million to $41 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.10 to $0.12 range per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion, which represents 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $180 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.51 per share at approximately 350 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And now some notes on the guidance. As usual, when providing guidance, we use more conservative assumptions than we have seen in our historical results. Our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for our long-term growth. Next, our model assumes greater expenses related to travel and in-person events going forward, but we remain flexible depending on further COVID developments, and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees. Finally, as it relates to our capital expenditures, we are catching up on office build-outs and expect CapEx as a percent of sales to roughly double compared to 2021. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in Q4 and 2021. We continue to innovate rapidly and broaden our platform capabilities with many more products planned to be launched in 2022. We have grown our go-to-market opportunities, including in the public sector with our FedRAMP Moderate Authorization and deepening our relationships with our cloud partners. And across the company, we are working hard to execute against our opportunities in 2022 and beyond. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q& A. Yes. That's because of the usage and the cross-sell and the efficiency of it in our frictionless adoption. So, it's an indication of both the robotics and the end market as well as the ability for clients to adopt more of the platform. Yes. And as we said since we went public that we are focusing on gross margins in the mid-70% to touching 80%. And that there will be periods of time that due to investment, they will tend towards to the middle or lower part of that range and then go up. And in this case, in this period of time, we were able to harvest efficiencies in our cloud costs. And like in other periods of the fluctuation of the gross margin, we've hit 80%. As we're investing, we may dip below that. But as we said in my prepared remarks, we feel confident that will remain in the mid-to-upper parts of the 70% range. Yes. Thank you. It's still the similar motion to what we've been experiencing, which means, for the most part, our $100,000-plus customers were started out lower than the $100,000, and our $1 million customers started lower than $1 million. We're still largely the land-and-expand. So, we see that motion continuing. And in addition to that, I think as we said in our prepared remarks, we're seeing, in some cases, where a client has a significant cloud presence and consolidates or outsources or goes to a system rather than open source, we would land and get to a large amount earlier, which we've talked about in some of our prepared comments. But for the most part, it still is that land and expand and evolve from lower deal sizes to the $100, 000 and $1 million as we've been discussing. And let me just add that, of course, we didn't have the APM and logs. We didn't have the breadth of the platform five years ago. So, as we talked about there, a number of customers where we had landed with infrastructure and as they are consolidating on the platform, they're buying our products, whether it be enhancement, whether it be movement from open source or whether it be replacement of the company's products that you're talking about. Yes, yes. I think \u2013 yes, thanks. I think overall, it's sort of the same ideology, which is to take what we've seen in the usage and numbers and discount it. I will say last year being in COVID, we took and we said this on the call, a bit more of a conservative approach. We had less \u2013 we had more uncertainty last year. So, I mean I think we adopted the same approach but applied a little more conservatism last year when we gave our original guidance. Thank you. We have very consistent performance on our cohorts across the different types of customers, the way they adopt the product and ramp. And that applies to larger deals as well as smaller. So, we have pretty good visibility, pretty good time series. There hasn't been a change in that pattern of adoption and we monitor that all the time as we look at increasing our ability to predict the revenue. We also, I think are in some cases looking at developing a functionality in account management to help our clients adopt faster. And that is sort of around the edges, but we have a pretty good idea of how our clients are adopting. Yes. In our guidance we have assumed a resumption of normal T&E and marketing events. We said previously that sort of in the 3% to 4% range. We estimate we've had cost savings due to lower-than-average T&E and marketing events. So, we've incorporated that in the guidance. We'll have to see how quickly that resumes. As we said, first priority is safety of our employees. But we've incorporated that. We've also, as we said have very aggressive hiring plans and we've incorporated that in. But as we said previously, we think the number is sort of on average around three plus in terms of COVID savings relative to T&E and marketing events as a percentage of revenues. Thank you. On the first question, yes, the land percentage of more than one product remains similar to what we said previously, in the 70s. No change in that motion. In terms of the gross retention, with the platform expanding and the standardization, one, we see some more stickiness. And as we always have, we're focusing on both account management, technical account management, working with our clients over a long term which we've done and continue to do. Oli?"

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this evening. We are extremely pleased with our performance in Q3, which was stronger than expected on robust growth with existing customers as well as strong new customer sales. We saw broad-based strength across product lines and across customer segments. Let me give you a quick summary of the quarter. Revenue was $270 million, an increase of 75% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,800 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,082 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 80% of our ARR. We have about 17,500 customers, which is up from about 13,100 last year. The leverage and efficiency of our business model is coming through with free cash flow of $57 million. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted on newer products. At a high level, positive business trends from recent quarters continued in Q3. Usage growth from existing customers was very strong this quarter across products. New logos ARR was robust with some large new deals closing and churn remains low and in line with historical rates. Taking all these factors into account, we had a record quarter of ARR added, and we crossed the milestone by exceeding $1 billion in ARR in Q3. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q3, 77% of customers are using two or more products, up from 71% a year ago. Additionally, 31% of customers are now using four or more products, which is up from 20% last year. And this quarter, about 70% of new logos landed with two or more products. Most strikingly, our whole platform saw strong growth in the third quarter. But in particular, that all of our major products added a record amount of ARR during the quarter, but also that the year-over-year growth of infrastructure monitoring ARR on its own accelerated this quarter. And finally that our log management and APM suite, which includes Synthetics, user monitoring and continuous profiler, remain in hyper growth mode. Together in Q3, they exceeded $500 million in the ARR. Now, let\u2019s move on to product and R&D. Our teams continue to innovate at a rapid pace. We had 40 new product-related announcements in Q3, and we made many announcements last week at Dash, or Annual User Conference. You can review our Dash press releases as well as two nights earnings for further description, but to summarize this briefly, we announced the availability of CI visibility, session replay, funnel analysis, network device monitoring, Datadog Apps and Online Archives for Log Management. We launched private betas for Cloud Cost Management, Observability Pipelines, Universal Service Monitoring and Application Security. And we also announced official Datadog support of the Vector open source product. Now looking back at a couple of these announcements. Some of them will increase Datadog\u2019s usefulness for business personas. Users who are not engineers, and can benefit from all the data flowing to Datadog. With Session Replay and Funnel Analysis, we believe support organizations, product designers and product managers can get value from understanding user behavior and interactions with applications. And we expect Cloud Cost Management will be useful to anyone involved in understanding and controlling the expense of cloud implementations from engineering teams to product managers to finance teams. We are also advancing our efforts to support our customers with large-scale complex data needs. So, I want to talk a bit, Vector, Observability Pipelines and Online Archives. Nine months ago, we acquired Timber, the developer of Vector. Vector is an open-source product that allows users to collect, enrich and transform observability data and automatically route it to the destination of their choice. Our Observability Pipelines product extends Vector and increased enterprise-level of capabilities for its data pipelines, and the ability for users to seamlessly manage it from Datadog across both on-premise and cloud accounts. Vector and Observability Pipelines let customers make value-based decisions on data as early as possible before they send data to Datadog or any other partner. We are always looking for ways to give customers more control over how they use their data and how they manage the cost of their cloud deployments. This is another step in that direction. And with online archive, we are aiming to solve the growing problem of storing all logs and being able to run complex historical investigations on them. Online Archives is an always-on log-warehousing solution that provides 15 months or more of extremely cost-effective storage online query capabilities. I also wanted to mention database monitoring, which we announced for general availability in August, and which gives our customers deep visibility into the performance and execution of queries across all of their databases. Finally, as announced in the press release issued this evening, we acquired Ozcode, a live debugging solution for net applications, which lets developers solve problems in real time, whether in development or in product environments. It is another example of our growing push into developer workflows. So, as we can tell, we were very busy in Q3. And I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their hard work and their relentless focus on our customers. Now, moving on to sales and marketing. Our go-to-market teams continue to be very productive, and we added 1,100 net new customers this quarter. So, let\u2019s review some of our Q3 wins. First, we had our largest deal ever by total contract value, and over $60 million five-year upsell with a multinational financial services company. Our history of success with this customer has led to the use of nine products, including early adoption of newer products such as RUM and Synthetics and APM. This customer began the second phase of their migration to the cloud and is standardizing on Datadog, adopting our newer products as we add them to our platform. Next, we had a seven-figure upsell with a global fashion retailer based in Asia. These customers saw e-commerce sales increased dramatically during the pandemic, and they began to use Datadog after several outages resulted in missed sales. After a disappointing implementation of a competing solution, they chose Datadog APM across their global e-commerce sites and saw immediate improvement in stability. Next, we had a six-figure land with a U.S.-based professional sports league, which came in partnership with Google Cloud Platform. This customer experienced a large spike in application usage as funds are returning to games for in a pandemic, but they had no clients at monitoring and therefore, nowhere to analyze and optimize the user experience. With Datadog Real User Monitoring and Synthetics, along with infrastructure monitoring and APM, the customer now has a single solution to manage experience from front-end to back-end. Next, we had a seven-figure land with the advertising division of a Fortune 10 company. This company has very strict SLAs for their platform as their customers rely on always-on availability to adjust ad budgets in real time. After conducting a full evaluation of internal solutions and APM providers, this customer began using Datadog infrastructure monitoring and APM and are motivated to expand their use of our platform within the enterprise. Finally, we had a large six-figure land with a U.S. distributor of plumbing and building equipment. This company needed to migrate from on-premise to Azure, and to deploy on Azure Kubernetes Service. But its existing APM solution had limited visibility into containers. With Datadog, this customer is able to effectively monitor the health of their Azure ecosystem, allowing them to confidently and efficiently complete migrations in retail legacy infrastructure. As you can see, our go-to-market teams had another quarter of strong execution. I want to thank them for once more successfully helping both new and existing customers to generate value from Datadog. Now moving on to our longer-term outlook. If you could not join us for our investor meeting last week, I encourage you to watch a video on the Investor Relations section of our website. At the meeting, we described our long-term opportunities, our differentiators and the expansion of our platforms over the years. To summarize my beat of the presentation, we see digital transformation and cloud migration as large forces driving exponential growth. We believe Datadog helps solve the growing problem of managing complexity for our customers and that our open-ended unified platform, designed to be simple but not simplistic, is deployed everywhere and used by everyone at our customers and that it helps break down silos between teams. We believe it is still early days for our opportunity in observability. And while we have made a lot of progress in building out a broad observability platform, we still have much to do to solve all of our problems customer pain points. One next step for us is in security, with our cloud security platform. And we believe we have a part to play in breaking down silos between development, corporations and security teams. But we\u2019re also making offers inroad in pure developer workflows with the general availability of CI Visibility. And we think over time, we have opportunities to help our customers in several other large adjacent markets as well. In other words, we are just getting started. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q3. Revenue was $270 million, up 75% year-over-year and up 16% quarter-over-quarter. Usage trends were strong, and showed broad-based growth. Customers continuing to adopt more products across the platform, and new logo generation was also strong. To provide some more context. First, growth of existing customers was robust in Q3, and our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 17th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was very strong, driven by customers\u2019 expanded usage of existing products and the adoption of new products. Our new customers from the last several quarters have expanded their usage quite rapidly, and we had some significant renewals with large customers in Q3. We also had a record quarter of ARR adds, including record ARR adds in all of our major products. And we saw strong growth across geographical regions, with all regions accelerated on a year-over-year basis compared to Q2. New logo results were also strong. Our enterprise and commercial sales teams had a crisp execution in this quarter, and new logo ARR was up strongly year-over-year. We continue to see opportunities broadly across industries and customer sizes. Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. And as we mentioned, 77% of our customers are now using two or more products, and 31% of our customers are using four or more products. And lastly, churn remained low and in line with historical levels. Our dollar-based gross retention rate remained unchanged in the mid-90s and is similar across all our customer segments and products. Turning to billings. The billings were $309 million, up 98% year-over-year. There were no pro forma impacts in the quarter. Note that we called out shorter-term billings duration in Q3 2020 last year. And billing duration in 3Q of this year is in line with recent quarters, but is higher on a year-over-year basis, driving higher year-over-year billings growth. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $719 million, up 127% year-over-year driven by strong sales activity, increased contract duration, and it was growing against an easier compare in the third quarter of last year. The increase in contract duration was driven by several large renewals with multiyear terms. As a reminder, multiyear commitments are built annually, and we don\u2019t incentivize our sales team towards multiyear deals. Current RPO growth was about 100% year-over-year as our mix shifted away from month-to-month deals to \u2013 on a year-over-year basis more towards semiannual and annual. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now, let\u2019s review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Starting with gross profit. Our gross profit in the quarter was $210 million, representing a gross margin of 78%. This compares to a gross margin of 76% last quarter and 79% in the year ago quarter. Due to our continued efforts to drive efficiencies in cloud costs, we expect our gross margin to increase sequentially in Q4. In the mid-to long term, we expect gross margin to remain in the high 70s range, typical of our historical performance. R&D expense was $84 million or 31% of revenue compared to 30% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest significantly in R&D, including high growth in our engineering headcount. Sales and marketing expense was $65 million or 24% of revenue compared to 32% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see strong efficiencies with our frictionless land-and-expand selling motion. We also had relatively few in-person events in Q3, but we continue to plan for increased travel and events cost going forward depending on local health and travel guidelines. G&A expense was $17 million or 6% of revenues compared to 8% in the year ago quarter. Operating income was $44 million or a 16% operating margin compared to an operating income of $14 million or 9% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest heavily against the large and dynamic market opportunity we see in front of us. But our product innovation, coupled with a strong go-to-market effort and a frictionless land-and-expand model is driving strong revenue growth and business model efficiencies. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $44 million or $0.13 per share based on 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $67 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $57 million for a free cash flow margin of 21%. Now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2021. We remain highly optimistic about our long-term opportunities, and we continue to work hard to execute against these opportunities. Taking this into account with the usual conservatism applied, we are updating our guidance as follows. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $290 million to $292 million, which represents 64% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $38 million to $40 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be between $0.11 and $0.12 per share based on 347 million average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year 2021, revenue is expected to be in the range of 293 to \u2013 sorry, $993 million to $995 million, which represents a 65% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $113 million to $135 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.39 per share to $0.40 per share based on approximately 344 million weighted average shares outstanding. Now some notes on guidance. while usage growth remained strong in Q3, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions. We would note that we typically see slower business activity towards the end of the fourth quarter as employees take vacations around the winter holidays. Next, our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for the long-term growth, and our model assumes greater expenses related to travel and in-person events going forward. However, we will remain flexible depending upon local regulations and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees. Regarding items below operating income, we expect approximately $0.7 million of Q4 non-GAAP net interest and other income, which includes interest income on our cash and marketable securities and the interest expense of our convertible debt. We do not expect to be a federal taxpayer, but of a tax provision related to international entities, we expect that tax provision to be approximately $600,000 in Q4 and $2 million for the full year. And now to summarize, we are very pleased with the results of this quarter. Our platform is resonating in the marketplace, and we saw strong performance across our products in Q3. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D. And with the launch of database monitoring and CI visibility, we now have 13 generally available products to offer our customers. Our execution against our go-to-market goals remain strong. And our ability to help our customers manage through their cloud migration and digital transformation efforts continues to expand. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on another really, really strong quarter. I had a question for Olivier. It\u2019s kind of more of a higher-level product-related question coming off of the user conference. And I guess the theme of it is that we hear the word observability much more often in 2021 and in 2019. I think you\u2019re starting to refer to different aspects of software in different domains. And I\u2019m wondering from your perspective, you guys obviously have a lot on your plenty of opportunity. When we\u2019re talking about bringing observability into other domains, whether it\u2019s the data pipeline or going to potentially in process mining because you guys do have log analytics solutions, are those potential opportunities in terms of bring observability to different domains from the Datadog perspective? Or are you sort of kind of come finding it to more of IT?\nOlivier Pomel: We know, we\u2019re all about breaking down silos and bring more use cases, more personalized under the same roof. And we are strong believers that with digital transformation, the application is going to run the business. And so if you understand the application, you can understand everything that has to \u2013 that happens around the business, which gives you an opportunity to bring many more teams in. So long term, yes, I mean all of these are interesting things for us to do, and we see some of our customers implementing some new use cases that we haven\u2019t productized on Datadog already today. I would say, today, we\u2019re still focused on the products we have brought to market and the ones that are still in beta, and we\u2019re taking it step-by-step. But yes, there\u2019s much more we can do and want to do.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. And then sort of talking about some of the usage and cohort behaviors that we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters, coming off the slowdown that we saw at the end of last summer, I think the theme has been is that the usage trends and the expansion trends have sort of been reverting to normal and getting back to even higher than the pre pandemic \u2013 sort of in line with the sort of pre-pandemic levels. As we stand in sort of going into the end of the year, how have those cohorts sort of changed? Is it just sort of continuing sort of usage? Or are you seeing different longer-term contracts? And in what sense \u2013 or what commonalities are you seeing across these cohorts that are different than just sort of the recovery off the end of last year?\nOlivier Pomel: There\u2019s actually not many differences between what we see in the most recent cohorts in the previous cohorts. The two main trends that we see that are underpinning the success you\u2019ve seen in the past few quarters \u2013 as you identified earlier, the fact that the pace of cloud migration and digital transformation has resumed to where it was. That\u2019s the first ingredient. The second ingredient is that our newer products are reaching scale and are being successful and are basically propping up our growth as we solve a larger and larger problem for our customers. So the combination of those two things really is what drives the success you\u2019ve seen.\nDavid Obstler: And we continue to have our usage increase be about two-thirds, usage of products the client had already, and about one-third adoption of new products. That\u2019s been pretty consistent over time. So, we continue to see similar types of adoption path.\nSanjit Singh: Makes some sense and very helpful, David, in terms of shedding some light on the split between those two vectors. Thank you very much and congrats on the strong Q3.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey thanks. Congrats from me as well. Olivier, can you \u2013 you mentioned some of the large renewals you saw this quarter. And obviously, that we would think they\u2019re kind of heavy users of Datadog. Can you just describe like how much of their estate is actually getting monitored by you, i.e., like how much have you penetrated then? And what kind of differentiates those customers from guys that are kind of smaller on your platform. So is that just a maturity thing? Or what are the drivers here that we need to think about?\nOlivier Pomel: I think it depends a little bit on the customers, obviously. But for some of the customers we\u2019ve mentioned, it\u2019s very clear that they\u2019re standardizing on Datadog. As I mentioned, a very large five-year deal, which is still somewhat atypical for us. But what this shows is that this is a customer that is far enough in their cloud transformation that they know where they\u2019re going. They\u2019re standardizing on us, and they plan over those five years to basically bring substantially everything they have into the cloud and in Datadog. So that\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s behind it. And Again, right now, we only see that from the \u2013 those of our large customers that are far enough in their cloud migration, and many of the \u2013 of our large enterprise customers have started this cloud migration more recently. But we think it\u2019s representative of what\u2019s going to happen at a larger scale a few years from now.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. And then one for David. If I look at the billings growth, you pointed out that you were at slightly better duration this year last year? Like do you think you would be able to quantify that a little bit? Is it like a \u2013 like is that a 20 points swing, a 10 points swing like some material, some materiality, but not too much. Like could you help us there?\nDavid Obstler: What we said in billings duration was we had large \u2013 generally been in sort of the seven months plus or minus then we had, had some contraction when in COVID last year down into the sixes. And now we\u2019re back up into that same range on billings duration that we had before in sort of the seven to eight months. The same thing happened in contract duration. Although the contract duration, we said was complemented by multiyear contracts, which expanded the RPO in this quarter, and maybe a bit unique in terms of the number of multiyear\u2019s that happened this quarter. \nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Congrats. Well done.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from as Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] sitting in for Kash. The question we have for you is, number one, can you please take rank for us the factors that have been contributing to revenue reacceleration? You talked about all the various pieces of the puzzle here, but is there any way to stack rank them in terms of most influential versus list influential? What drove the revenue acceleration here?\nOlivier Pomel: The two main factors really are the resumption of cloud migration to the speed it had before the pandemic, and that\u2019s number one. And this one, we don\u2019t fully control, right? I mean that\u2019s something that is highly dependent on the business environment around us. The second factor is the success of our new products and decide that we\u2019re \u2013 we mentioned on the call, our APM and log products together reached more than $500 million in ARR. So not only are they growing very fast, like they say in hypergrowth but also they contribute quite a bit to the revenue of the company. And we have more products coming up after that, but are also going very fast. So this is the second factor. The third factor is that on the back of that, like with all the demand environment being there and with us solving a larger and larger problem, we successfully scaled the go-to-market teams, so we can actually go after this opportunity. So combine all those three. That\u2019s how you get the direct generation of growth, yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. And as a follow-up, can you please comment on the hyperscalers to what extent they be contributing to growth? You signed deeper relationship with Azure last year, GCP as well, and others. How important of that \u2013 how important those partnerships can become in terms of go-to-market motion for you? Thank you. Thank you for taking our questions.\nOlivier Pomel: So we see that in a number of deals. I would say it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s no drastic change from what we\u2019ve seen before. It\u2019s a continuation of what we\u2019ve done with the hyperscalers before. I think in some areas, we\u2019re a little bit more deliberate now in terms of the partnerships we put in place, and I think they are a little bit more defined than they used to be before maybe in some cases. But I would say they are not \u2013 like these partnerships don\u2019t have any specific capacity \u2013 set capacity attached to them online, but they are not part of our model for growth going forward. They\u2019re all upside from where we are. So we keep investing in those partnerships. We think they are part of what we do, but they\u2019re not the main way we go-to-market. \nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. I\u2019m curious in terms of your existing customer growth that you saw in the quarter. Can you characterize how much of that growth is just coming from their growth and expansion in the number of cloud hosts versus adopting more Datadog products?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. I think we said that similar to previous quarters, about two-thirds of our growth. And that\u2019s comparing the size of the customer today versus the previous year comes from \u2013 has come from expansion of their use of products that they had already bought. And about one-third has come from their adoption of the new products, and that\u2019s been pretty consistent over time. So that\u2019s how that splits.\nOlivier Pomel: At the back of the, you know roughly how the cloud providers are growing, and you see how we\u2019re going compared to them. So it gives you an idea basically of the lift we\u2019re getting from additional sales capacity around additional coverage, but also the \u2013 the growth of our product suite.\nSterling Auty: Understood. And then one quick one on sales. Can you characterize where you are on sales capacity and your efforts to continue to hire, to fuel the growth?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, so we\u2019re doing \u2013 we have more capacity than last quarter and much less than next quarter. So we\u2019re still investing heavily. We\u2019re growing those teams. And we\u2019re also investing not only in the hiring of the retention, but also in all of the enablement and training and the career pathing so we can make the most of our go-to-market team. So there\u2019s no \u2013 again, no big change there from previous quarters where we keep investing.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much. Oli, on that massive financial services deal that you signed in the quarter, how much influence it newer on-prem products like networking and pipelines have on the decision there? Or is that potential longer-term upside even with that large client?\nOlivier Pomel: With that specific client, without getting into too much detail, not much. Because it\u2019s a client that is, I would say, a bit further along in their cloud migration. And they\u2019re moving a lot of their workloads into cloud environments in the end. For some other of our customers that we\u2019re not mentioning on this call, this is a big deal, and this is something that they\u2019re spending quite a bit of time on with us right now. So it \u2013 you probably will hear us about it in further calls, I would say.\nBrad Reback: That\u2019s great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open. Tyler, if you\u2019re on mute, please unmute your phone.\nTyler Radke: Hi, there. Can you hear me now?\nOperator: Yes.\nTyler Radke: Sorry about that. I wanted to talk about the strength that you saw on some of the larger lands. And I think you called out a number of 7-figure lands. And I\u2019m curious, do you think at a high level, this is mainly driven by specific go-to-market investment? I know you\u2019ve obviously been growing the sales force including the enterprise? Or is this simply just the product set kind of at a maturity point where you\u2019re just kind of seeing this demand more organically?\nOlivier Pomel: It\u2019s a bit of everything, right? So obviously, the product strength is what we rest on so that it solves the problem \u2013 the customer problem really well and it\u2019s very easy to adopt in not fractions. So that\u2019s not new. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve built the company the whole time and it\u2019s still there. But also with a product that is growing very fast at customers, as you grow your go-to-market teams, you have to be deliberate about the way these go-to-market team so that you don\u2019t just stop at the customers. You have the data already drive a lot of growth. You also go out of your way to acquire new ones. And so we\u2019re also always tweaking the way we\u2019re on the go-to-market teams to make sure that we focus the teams and reward the teams for landing new customers. So yes, we keep tweaking that over time to make sure that we don\u2019t become victims of the success of our product when it comes to organically growing within customers.\nTyler Radke: Yes. And just a follow-up on that. I\u2019m curious, obviously, at Dash, you talked about a lot of security products. To what extent is the product road map around application security really influencing these larger deals? And is that an important consideration with these customers making these commitments, just kind of where they see your product road map going?\nOlivier Pomel: It starts coming up in conversations more and more, but it\u2019s still early for the convergence of DevOps and security. So when you talk about a five year strategic alignment with customers, security is a part of the conversation. But for most of our customers today, it\u2019s still a second step. Like they start with sustainability. They start with the cloud. They start with what we have today. And then they want to actually bring security under the same roof as observatory data.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thanks. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt Hedberg. And my congratulations on the quarter as well as the new acquisition in Ozcode. Could you go a little bit more into the technology there? And specifically, kind of what you\u2019re adding, that\u2019s differentiated from your automated incident management product? Because I know you said you could do debugging production. Is it just part of the actual beginning stages of the DevOps life cycle? Or is that maybe you could get merged into that product?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So it\u2019s actually \u2013 where it stands in the stack is it\u2019s like the debugging meaning that the same way you can use a debugger on your laptop and place a breakpoint in and see what the code is doing and the variables in the code are and things like that. You see technology that lets you do that in production environment. So you can \u2013 in your ID, you can breakpoint in the code and the current production is actually going to tell you what\u2019s going on in the code at that moment at that time. You don\u2019t have to update the code. You don\u2019t have to shift software. So it\u2019s something that developers are used to doing in development environment. And this is technology, lets you do that in production as well. So it\u2019s very interesting to us. It\u2019s also something that corresponds to some work we\u2019ve been doing internally. So there\u2019s three things that are interesting to us about the Ozcode acquisition. One is live debugging technology, which is very interesting. Second is it\u2019s a quite that focuses specializes on .NET, which is capability that is very interesting to many of our large enterprise customers. And that is often underserved by newer \u2013 I would say newer innovations in the market. And then the third thing that\u2019s interesting to us is that this is going to be our first engineering team in Israel. And we do intend to grow that team and invest quite a bit.\nMatt Swanson: That\u2019s really helpful. One other thing, I guess, thinking more from a higher level, when we think about DevSecOps. I feel like it\u2019s a term that we\u2019re hearing more and more from more companies. So I mean, kind of core to establishing \u2013 breaking down those silos is going to be consolidating spend down to certain vendors. Is there a way you guys think about kind of the gravity of those budgets between the three sections. Is there 1 area that you need to be at the core of? Do you think developers have the most power, security has the most power? I\u2019m just trying to think as more and more companies try to build across those three areas. What do you see as deciding who wins that consolidation?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Well, I think there are three things that have been massive. One is there\u2019s many more developers than any other role. So they have power by virtue of being the most populous and the largest salary mass and everything else. So you get quite a bit of yield in serving developers. The second thing that is massive is the amount of friction for instrumenting applications. And the third thing that is massive is the data volumes in terms of logs. And I think we have a strong advantage on all three compared to pure-play security vendors for that space.\nMatt Swanson: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes to Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: David, the numbers are obviously all accelerating. I guess, kind of underpinning the numbers, is there anything new you would call that was striking to you that you haven\u2019t seen. Is there any common themes that maybe we can\u2019t see in the numbers that also account to the strength and what you\u2019re seeing in the overall results this quarter?\nDavid Obstler: I think it\u2019s a combination of a number of things at the same time, strong lands over a number of quarters, which then began to use the product and accelerate \u2013 acceleration of budgets around cloud migration, which caused the usage to increase, and continue to be strong, and cross-sell of other products as our product suite gets adopted and the success there, more of the products as we showed are getting adopted by the clients. So the combination of all of those at the same time and strength geographically across all the regions caused the acceleration from last year\u2019s post-COVID type of results.\nBrent Thill: And maybe for Olivier, just as it relates to cloud migrations, one of the things we continue to hear about is a dual-cloud strategy or even multi-cloud strategy. Are you seeing that starting to help your business? Or is that still yet to come?\nOlivier Pomel: We definitely see it. Our customers are very clear on the fact that they are going to be multi-cloud. They often start multi-cloud even though initially, they\u2019re going to have more weight in one cloud than another. So it\u2019s frequent for customers when they start the cloud migration to have \u2013 to pick two of the major cloud to have maybe 95% of their volume in 1% and 5% in the other. But their goal is always to be able to, further down the road, choose whether they make further investment in one or the other or even on a third on-prem option that would be a private cloud. So this is a plan that we hear more and more from pretty much all of our customers. And we see that \u2013 as we see our customers getting further along like some of the ones we\u2019ve mentioned on the call today, we definitely see them making multi-cloud decisions there.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes to Michael Turtis from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nMichael Turtis: Hi guys. I just want to ask two overlapping questions about the sales force. On the one hand, and I think Tom may have talked about this a bit at Dash, but how are you addressing with the single primary sales force, the different buying centers and buyers between security, development and business users. And also, how is the sales force evolving from reps that probably, really sold essentially one product and now have to sell so many more products. That\u2019s frequently a tough time for transition in the sales force.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So today, we\u2019re still not specializing the sales force. We\u2019ve discussed a little bit in the past call, we still \u2013 we think with security, we might have to do a little bit of specialization. We\u2019re testing a few things, but we haven\u2019t felt the need to do anything drastic just yet.  For the rest of our products, today, it works quite well to have the same sales force carry the various products. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that, the adoption of those products tends to be frictionless. And so we don\u2019t need to land all the products at once. We\u2019re going to land a few. And then we need to nudge our customers a little bit to start adopting more of them over time as they get more and more values from Datadog, but the lift there is not as heavy as if we had to come back and do a big bank sale every single time. So today, no specialization, yet. I think it \u2013 some of it is likely to happen over time in all likelihood with security, but we haven\u2019t done anything yet there.\nMichael Turtis: And as I said, do you find that the sales force that\u2019s been with you selling \u2013 I mean your product is always diverse, but was essentially an observability product, more in the traditional monitoring sense. Is that same sales force adapting to this much wider portfolio? Or are you starting to see a turnover in that sales force to accommodate that?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. The sales force is adapting. I think mostly what we\u2019re working on is the structures behind the scene to target the sales force and to enable the sales force, so they know basically who to talk to about what product when. And it\u2019s actually one of the things that Adam Blitzer has been working on, bringing to us a bit of his experience with similar problems at his previous company.\nMichael Turtis: Thanks, Olivier.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair. Your line is open.\nKamil Mielczarek: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the amazing quarter. It\u2019s great to hear about the record deal and the record ARR adds across the platform. As your largest customers scale and standardize on Datadog, can you talk about how conversations have changed around pricing? Are there any particular modules where maybe you\u2019re seeing relatively higher levels of pushback on cost? And given the rapid \u2013 especially given the rapid growth in data and the pricing changes made by some of your competitors over the past two years?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, I mean, usually the module for which is the most pushback is the one that happens to be the biggest item for that customer. Overall, the \u2013 there\u2019s one thing that you\u2019ve correctly identified, which is data volumes are just going to explode much faster than customers\u2019 revenues are going to go up. And so we need to be able to differentiate from a technical perspective to solve these problems in a different way of our customers or to give them more control so they can target what they are \u2013 they need to keep. A number of these things we\u2019ve announced at Dash last week actually, were meant to help with that. So I\u2019ve talked about observability pipeline as one of them. The live archive for logs is another one of them. And there\u2019s going to be more of a time to address that. So we didn\u2019t make any pricing changes, but we are innovating from a product perspective to have new ways of solving these problems and to give more control to our customers.\nKamil Mielczarek: It makes a lot of sense. And on following up on the product innovation, your R&D expense is up more than 80% year-to-date, well above the 2020 levels of growth. It\u2019s great to see the fruits of these investments with the numerous announcements of Datadog Dash, but can you give us more detail around the decision to accelerate the level of R&D spend over the past year? And has anything changed about the broader opportunity versus pre-pandemic to drive this elevated level of spend? And how should we think about the targeted cadence of future product introductions? I know there\u2019s a lot there. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, we\u2019re going as fast as we can on the engineering side. It so happens that we could sustain a very high growth on the recruiting and retention side. And we\u2019re very confident that our platform lends itself to solving bigger problems, more problems and to making those products successful. So we\u2019re scaling them as fast as we can. It\u2019s important to go fast when scaling those teams because there\u2019s quite a bit of a lead time between the time when you hire engineers and the time when you get new products on the other hand. I\u2019ve mentioned in other calls like maybe hiring now is a good predictor of output two years from now on the engineering side. So we should get started. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it. \nKamil Mielczarek: That\u2019s great. Congrats, again. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Yun Kim from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nYun Kim: Great. Thank you. Congrats on the soli quarter as well for me. But Oli, you\u2019re already bigger than all your near-term or nearest competitors growing faster than all of them by a couple of magnitude. You talked about enterprise standardization trend that led to your largest deal in the company\u2019s history. So are you seeing more and more of that enterprise standardization trend with large organization? And as a result, are you seeing more and more displacement deals out there rather than just simply selling into large Greenfield opportunities?\nOlivier Pomel: So I would say it is still \u2013 the bulk of the standardization is still has to come, right? And it depends on the maturity of our customers\u2019 migration into their \u2013 into the cloud more than the adoption of our product, I would say. But we definitely think that it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to play a big role in the years to come. When that happens, when standardization happens, there is typically some displacement because what was used on the legacy side or on the other side of the shop is going to be left behind, and we\u2019re going to replace that. And that\u2019s part of the valid rationalization that takes place. But again, today, it\u2019s still a small part of what we do. We \u2013 the bulk of our business is still net new cloud environment, a lot of growth in the cloud environment with the occasional replacement of unsuccessful deployments of previous tools.\nYun Kim: So just for your existing customers, are you seeing many of your customers having a mixed vendors of the observability products like, for instance, they have your product, along with some of the other parts of the organization may have some of your competitive products as well. So it\u2019s just a matter of time before the customer needs to standardize on one platform.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So there is a \u2013 what we see is any time we land into a large enterprise, for example \u2013 and we\u2019re going to start in the cloud environment. Their on-prem environments are going to have a collection of other things. They\u2019re going to have older infrastructure monitors like the BMCs and [indiscernible] of the world. They\u2019re going to have older ATMs. They\u2019re going to have Splunk and Elastic somewhere in on-prem as well. It\u2019s a given. But we\u2019re not going to displace that from day one. We\u2019re going to be a solution that are going to be in environment and we\u2019re going to displace those products as the customers reach critical mass in the cloud, and this starts standardizing.  So we \u2013 but we think from what we see, the customers that are doing that today are the ones who are far along in their cloud migration and started that one like a few years ago. So we think this is going to be low in the years to come.\nYun Kim: Thank you. And David, just a quick question on cash flow dynamics. Obviously, your contract link is increasing. You\u2019re getting more and more large number of deals. Do you expect the cash flow to be more or less \u2013 see more greater seasonality maybe weighted towards more second half of the year going forward?\nDavid Obstler: No. We \u2013 I think we said in the script that even though we\u2019ve gone \u2013 we\u2019ve had some more multi years, there\u2019s still annual billing at most. We don\u2019t go for financing the company through collecting events. So there really is very little, as we talked about, long-term change in the billing dynamics. In terms of cash flow, we tend to see a little bit of seasonality at the end of the year when we go through our sales \u2013 end of the year sales cycle and then collect in the first quarter. But I wouldn\u2019t see too much change in the cash flow dynamics from either the longer duration of contracts or seasonality.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you. Olivier, just to follow-up on the security go-to-market. Your security monitoring product has now been GJ [ph] for a while, whereas some of the other components of your cloud security platform are much newer. But what I\u2019m wondering is, how would you assess the readiness of your sales force and your channel to sell security to your installed base today?\nOlivier Pomel: Today, it\u2019s still a product that is being adopted by customers when they already let at our customers that we don\u2019t \u2013 we really land with it first. And that\u2019s by design, right? That\u2019s \u2013 as we keep developing it, and we keep making it applicable to a broader set of customers. We are starting though \u2013 we\u2019re getting to the point where soon we\u2019ll have the full V1 of our cloud security platform. I think for that, we\u2019re still missing the general availability of the application security component. Once we have that, I think we look into accelerating the go-to-market side a little bit and maybe doing some of the specialization we\u2019ve been discussing earlier in this call, but we haven\u2019t done that yet.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: I suppose it\u2019s a two for one deal today. Thank you so much for taking me and along with my colleague here. As you look at calendar 2022, you\u2019ve had a see of new products that you\u2019ve added to the portfolio, including some of the demos that you apply enable demonstrated to us last week, I believe. Any changes, enhancements or tweaks to go-to-market as you look at 2022. And also, as you look to clearly signing these five year contracts and mega contracts are a change in the way customers look at Datadog. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re embolden to pursue a specific enterprise sales channel and having a separate go-to-market effort that is in pointedly in pursuit of mega deals. Thank you so much. Just like our friends at Salesforce started doing some five, six years back or so, and it was definitely fruitful. I\u2019m wondering if you see the same kind of opportunity.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So we do \u2013 so first of all, I mean, we \u2013 I mean, yes, customers see us differently over time. I mean we are definitely \u2013 like we\u2019re becoming one of the platforms that they are going to standardize big points of their business around, and that\u2019s definitely a different relationship with them than just something some people on their team are using. So that\u2019s the change we see. And we see across a large number of our customers. Now in terms of pursuing the \u2013 larger deal, I mean, we do have different ways of structuring our teams internally so that we have folks that are going after new logos that might be smaller, folks that are going after growth of reaching customers, folks that are going after the growth of the very biggest customers. And we have some segmentation internally on that, and we\u2019ll have more and more segmentation as we grow as we need to focus a little bit every one. But we\u2019re still not looking for those very large deals. We do them today when our customers want them. When they need the \u2013 for their own planning purposes. And when they want to commit their own organizations, we\u2019ll do those deals for them. But this is not something that we actively seek. Our product and we\u2019ve seen throughout the year that our product is very sticky, and then our product grows very well with our customers. So there\u2019s no point on our end in pushing for very large, very long-term deals.\nKash Rangan: Wonderful. Thank you, Olivier. Congratulations.\nOlivier Pomel: And I think on these good words, I think we\u2019ll close the call. So I want to thank you all for this \u2013 for sticking with us to the call. We\u2019re all very happy obviously with the performance this quarter, which is all thanks to the team at Datadog and Datadog\u2019s worldwide and their hard work. And so I want to congratulate against everyone, and thank everyone for a job very, very well done. And we\u2019ll see you all next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this evening. We are extremely pleased with our performance in Q3, which was stronger than expected on robust growth with existing customers as well as strong new customer sales. We saw broad-based strength across product lines and across customer segments. Let me give you a quick summary of the quarter. Revenue was $270 million, an increase of 75% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,800 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,082 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 80% of our ARR. We have about 17,500 customers, which is up from about 13,100 last year. The leverage and efficiency of our business model is coming through with free cash flow of $57 million. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted on newer products. At a high level, positive business trends from recent quarters continued in Q3. Usage growth from existing customers was very strong this quarter across products. New logos ARR was robust with some large new deals closing and churn remains low and in line with historical rates. Taking all these factors into account, we had a record quarter of ARR added, and we crossed the milestone by exceeding $1 billion in ARR in Q3. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q3, 77% of customers are using two or more products, up from 71% a year ago. Additionally, 31% of customers are now using four or more products, which is up from 20% last year. And this quarter, about 70% of new logos landed with two or more products. Most strikingly, our whole platform saw strong growth in the third quarter. But in particular, that all of our major products added a record amount of ARR during the quarter, but also that the year-over-year growth of infrastructure monitoring ARR on its own accelerated this quarter. And finally that our log management and APM suite, which includes Synthetics, user monitoring and continuous profiler, remain in hyper growth mode. Together in Q3, they exceeded $500 million in the ARR. Now, let's move on to product and R&D. Our teams continue to innovate at a rapid pace. We had 40 new product-related announcements in Q3, and we made many announcements last week at Dash, or Annual User Conference. You can review our Dash press releases as well as two nights earnings for further description, but to summarize this briefly, we announced the availability of CI visibility, session replay, funnel analysis, network device monitoring, Datadog Apps and Online Archives for Log Management. We launched private betas for Cloud Cost Management, Observability Pipelines, Universal Service Monitoring and Application Security. And we also announced official Datadog support of the Vector open source product. Now looking back at a couple of these announcements. Some of them will increase Datadog's usefulness for business personas. Users who are not engineers, and can benefit from all the data flowing to Datadog. With Session Replay and Funnel Analysis, we believe support organizations, product designers and product managers can get value from understanding user behavior and interactions with applications. And we expect Cloud Cost Management will be useful to anyone involved in understanding and controlling the expense of cloud implementations from engineering teams to product managers to finance teams. We are also advancing our efforts to support our customers with large-scale complex data needs. So, I want to talk a bit, Vector, Observability Pipelines and Online Archives. Nine months ago, we acquired Timber, the developer of Vector. Vector is an open-source product that allows users to collect, enrich and transform observability data and automatically route it to the destination of their choice. Our Observability Pipelines product extends Vector and increased enterprise-level of capabilities for its data pipelines, and the ability for users to seamlessly manage it from Datadog across both on-premise and cloud accounts. Vector and Observability Pipelines let customers make value-based decisions on data as early as possible before they send data to Datadog or any other partner. We are always looking for ways to give customers more control over how they use their data and how they manage the cost of their cloud deployments. This is another step in that direction. And with online archive, we are aiming to solve the growing problem of storing all logs and being able to run complex historical investigations on them. Online Archives is an always-on log-warehousing solution that provides 15 months or more of extremely cost-effective storage online query capabilities. I also wanted to mention database monitoring, which we announced for general availability in August, and which gives our customers deep visibility into the performance and execution of queries across all of their databases. Finally, as announced in the press release issued this evening, we acquired Ozcode, a live debugging solution for net applications, which lets developers solve problems in real time, whether in development or in product environments. It is another example of our growing push into developer workflows. So, as we can tell, we were very busy in Q3. And I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their hard work and their relentless focus on our customers. Now, moving on to sales and marketing. Our go-to-market teams continue to be very productive, and we added 1,100 net new customers this quarter. So, let's review some of our Q3 wins. First, we had our largest deal ever by total contract value, and over $60 million five-year upsell with a multinational financial services company. Our history of success with this customer has led to the use of nine products, including early adoption of newer products such as RUM and Synthetics and APM. This customer began the second phase of their migration to the cloud and is standardizing on Datadog, adopting our newer products as we add them to our platform. Next, we had a seven-figure upsell with a global fashion retailer based in Asia. These customers saw e-commerce sales increased dramatically during the pandemic, and they began to use Datadog after several outages resulted in missed sales. After a disappointing implementation of a competing solution, they chose Datadog APM across their global e-commerce sites and saw immediate improvement in stability. Next, we had a six-figure land with a U.S.-based professional sports league, which came in partnership with Google Cloud Platform. This customer experienced a large spike in application usage as funds are returning to games for in a pandemic, but they had no clients at monitoring and therefore, nowhere to analyze and optimize the user experience. With Datadog Real User Monitoring and Synthetics, along with infrastructure monitoring and APM, the customer now has a single solution to manage experience from front-end to back-end. Next, we had a seven-figure land with the advertising division of a Fortune 10 company. This company has very strict SLAs for their platform as their customers rely on always-on availability to adjust ad budgets in real time. After conducting a full evaluation of internal solutions and APM providers, this customer began using Datadog infrastructure monitoring and APM and are motivated to expand their use of our platform within the enterprise. Finally, we had a large six-figure land with a U.S. distributor of plumbing and building equipment. This company needed to migrate from on-premise to Azure, and to deploy on Azure Kubernetes Service. But its existing APM solution had limited visibility into containers. With Datadog, this customer is able to effectively monitor the health of their Azure ecosystem, allowing them to confidently and efficiently complete migrations in retail legacy infrastructure. As you can see, our go-to-market teams had another quarter of strong execution. I want to thank them for once more successfully helping both new and existing customers to generate value from Datadog. Now moving on to our longer-term outlook. If you could not join us for our investor meeting last week, I encourage you to watch a video on the Investor Relations section of our website. At the meeting, we described our long-term opportunities, our differentiators and the expansion of our platforms over the years. To summarize my beat of the presentation, we see digital transformation and cloud migration as large forces driving exponential growth. We believe Datadog helps solve the growing problem of managing complexity for our customers and that our open-ended unified platform, designed to be simple but not simplistic, is deployed everywhere and used by everyone at our customers and that it helps break down silos between teams. We believe it is still early days for our opportunity in observability. And while we have made a lot of progress in building out a broad observability platform, we still have much to do to solve all of our problems customer pain points. One next step for us is in security, with our cloud security platform. And we believe we have a part to play in breaking down silos between development, corporations and security teams. But we're also making offers inroad in pure developer workflows with the general availability of CI Visibility. And we think over time, we have opportunities to help our customers in several other large adjacent markets as well. In other words, we are just getting started. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO. David? We know, we're all about breaking down silos and bring more use cases, more personalized under the same roof. And we are strong believers that with digital transformation, the application is going to run the business. And so if you understand the application, you can understand everything that has to \u2013 that happens around the business, which gives you an opportunity to bring many more teams in. So long term, yes, I mean all of these are interesting things for us to do, and we see some of our customers implementing some new use cases that we haven't productized on Datadog already today. I would say, today, we're still focused on the products we have brought to market and the ones that are still in beta, and we're taking it step-by-step. But yes, there's much more we can do and want to do. There's actually not many differences between what we see in the most recent cohorts in the previous cohorts. The two main trends that we see that are underpinning the success you've seen in the past few quarters \u2013 as you identified earlier, the fact that the pace of cloud migration and digital transformation has resumed to where it was. That's the first ingredient. The second ingredient is that our newer products are reaching scale and are being successful and are basically propping up our growth as we solve a larger and larger problem for our customers. So the combination of those two things really is what drives the success you've seen. I think it depends a little bit on the customers, obviously. But for some of the customers we've mentioned, it's very clear that they're standardizing on Datadog. As I mentioned, a very large five-year deal, which is still somewhat atypical for us. But what this shows is that this is a customer that is far enough in their cloud transformation that they know where they're going. They're standardizing on us, and they plan over those five years to basically bring substantially everything they have into the cloud and in Datadog. So that's the \u2013 that's what's behind it. And Again, right now, we only see that from the \u2013 those of our large customers that are far enough in their cloud migration, and many of the \u2013 of our large enterprise customers have started this cloud migration more recently. But we think it's representative of what's going to happen at a larger scale a few years from now. Thanks. The two main factors really are the resumption of cloud migration to the speed it had before the pandemic, and that's number one. And this one, we don't fully control, right? I mean that's something that is highly dependent on the business environment around us. The second factor is the success of our new products and decide that we're \u2013 we mentioned on the call, our APM and log products together reached more than $500 million in ARR. So not only are they growing very fast, like they say in hypergrowth but also they contribute quite a bit to the revenue of the company. And we have more products coming up after that, but are also going very fast. So this is the second factor. The third factor is that on the back of that, like with all the demand environment being there and with us solving a larger and larger problem, we successfully scaled the go-to-market teams, so we can actually go after this opportunity. So combine all those three. That's how you get the direct generation of growth, yes. So we see that in a number of deals. I would say it's \u2013 there's no drastic change from what we've seen before. It's a continuation of what we've done with the hyperscalers before. I think in some areas, we're a little bit more deliberate now in terms of the partnerships we put in place, and I think they are a little bit more defined than they used to be before maybe in some cases. But I would say they are not \u2013 like these partnerships don't have any specific capacity \u2013 set capacity attached to them online, but they are not part of our model for growth going forward. They're all upside from where we are. So we keep investing in those partnerships. We think they are part of what we do, but they're not the main way we go-to-market. At the back of the, you know roughly how the cloud providers are growing, and you see how we're going compared to them. So it gives you an idea basically of the lift we're getting from additional sales capacity around additional coverage, but also the \u2013 the growth of our product suite. Well, so we're doing \u2013 we have more capacity than last quarter and much less than next quarter. So we're still investing heavily. We're growing those teams. And we're also investing not only in the hiring of the retention, but also in all of the enablement and training and the career pathing so we can make the most of our go-to-market team. So there's no \u2013 again, no big change there from previous quarters where we keep investing. With that specific client, without getting into too much detail, not much. Because it's a client that is, I would say, a bit further along in their cloud migration. And they're moving a lot of their workloads into cloud environments in the end. For some other of our customers that we're not mentioning on this call, this is a big deal, and this is something that they're spending quite a bit of time on with us right now. So it \u2013 you probably will hear us about it in further calls, I would say. It's a bit of everything, right? So obviously, the product strength is what we rest on so that it solves the problem \u2013 the customer problem really well and it's very easy to adopt in not fractions. So that's not new. That's what we've built the company the whole time and it's still there. But also with a product that is growing very fast at customers, as you grow your go-to-market teams, you have to be deliberate about the way these go-to-market team so that you don't just stop at the customers. You have the data already drive a lot of growth. You also go out of your way to acquire new ones. And so we're also always tweaking the way we're on the go-to-market teams to make sure that we focus the teams and reward the teams for landing new customers. So yes, we keep tweaking that over time to make sure that we don't become victims of the success of our product when it comes to organically growing within customers. It starts coming up in conversations more and more, but it's still early for the convergence of DevOps and security. So when you talk about a five year strategic alignment with customers, security is a part of the conversation. But for most of our customers today, it's still a second step. Like they start with sustainability. They start with the cloud. They start with what we have today. And then they want to actually bring security under the same roof as observatory data. Yes. So it's actually \u2013 where it stands in the stack is it's like the debugging meaning that the same way you can use a debugger on your laptop and place a breakpoint in and see what the code is doing and the variables in the code are and things like that. You see technology that lets you do that in production environment. So you can \u2013 in your ID, you can breakpoint in the code and the current production is actually going to tell you what's going on in the code at that moment at that time. You don't have to update the code. You don't have to shift software. So it's something that developers are used to doing in development environment. And this is technology, lets you do that in production as well. So it's very interesting to us. It's also something that corresponds to some work we've been doing internally. So there's three things that are interesting to us about the Ozcode acquisition. One is live debugging technology, which is very interesting. Second is it's a quite that focuses specializes on .NET, which is capability that is very interesting to many of our large enterprise customers. And that is often underserved by newer \u2013 I would say newer innovations in the market. And then the third thing that's interesting to us is that this is going to be our first engineering team in Israel. And we do intend to grow that team and invest quite a bit. Yes. Well, I think there are three things that have been massive. One is there's many more developers than any other role. So they have power by virtue of being the most populous and the largest salary mass and everything else. So you get quite a bit of yield in serving developers. The second thing that is massive is the amount of friction for instrumenting applications. And the third thing that is massive is the data volumes in terms of logs. And I think we have a strong advantage on all three compared to pure-play security vendors for that space. We definitely see it. Our customers are very clear on the fact that they are going to be multi-cloud. They often start multi-cloud even though initially, they're going to have more weight in one cloud than another. So it's frequent for customers when they start the cloud migration to have \u2013 to pick two of the major cloud to have maybe 95% of their volume in 1% and 5% in the other. But their goal is always to be able to, further down the road, choose whether they make further investment in one or the other or even on a third on-prem option that would be a private cloud. So this is a plan that we hear more and more from pretty much all of our customers. And we see that \u2013 as we see our customers getting further along like some of the ones we've mentioned on the call today, we definitely see them making multi-cloud decisions there. Yes. So today, we're still not specializing the sales force. We've discussed a little bit in the past call, we still \u2013 we think with security, we might have to do a little bit of specialization. We're testing a few things, but we haven't felt the need to do anything drastic just yet.  For the rest of our products, today, it works quite well to have the same sales force carry the various products. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that, the adoption of those products tends to be frictionless. And so we don't need to land all the products at once. We're going to land a few. And then we need to nudge our customers a little bit to start adopting more of them over time as they get more and more values from Datadog, but the lift there is not as heavy as if we had to come back and do a big bank sale every single time. So today, no specialization, yet. I think it \u2013 some of it is likely to happen over time in all likelihood with security, but we haven't done anything yet there. Yes. The sales force is adapting. I think mostly what we're working on is the structures behind the scene to target the sales force and to enable the sales force, so they know basically who to talk to about what product when. And it's actually one of the things that Adam Blitzer has been working on, bringing to us a bit of his experience with similar problems at his previous company. Well, I mean, usually the module for which is the most pushback is the one that happens to be the biggest item for that customer. Overall, the \u2013 there's one thing that you've correctly identified, which is data volumes are just going to explode much faster than customers' revenues are going to go up. And so we need to be able to differentiate from a technical perspective to solve these problems in a different way of our customers or to give them more control so they can target what they are \u2013 they need to keep. A number of these things we've announced at Dash last week actually, were meant to help with that. So I've talked about observability pipeline as one of them. The live archive for logs is another one of them. And there's going to be more of a time to address that. So we didn't make any pricing changes, but we are innovating from a product perspective to have new ways of solving these problems and to give more control to our customers. Well, we're going as fast as we can on the engineering side. It so happens that we could sustain a very high growth on the recruiting and retention side. And we're very confident that our platform lends itself to solving bigger problems, more problems and to making those products successful. So we're scaling them as fast as we can. It's important to go fast when scaling those teams because there's quite a bit of a lead time between the time when you hire engineers and the time when you get new products on the other hand. I've mentioned in other calls like maybe hiring now is a good predictor of output two years from now on the engineering side. So we should get started. That's why we're doing it. Thank you. So I would say it is still \u2013 the bulk of the standardization is still has to come, right? And it depends on the maturity of our customers' migration into their \u2013 into the cloud more than the adoption of our product, I would say. But we definitely think that it's something that's going to play a big role in the years to come. When that happens, when standardization happens, there is typically some displacement because what was used on the legacy side or on the other side of the shop is going to be left behind, and we're going to replace that. And that's part of the valid rationalization that takes place. But again, today, it's still a small part of what we do. We \u2013 the bulk of our business is still net new cloud environment, a lot of growth in the cloud environment with the occasional replacement of unsuccessful deployments of previous tools. Yes. So there is a \u2013 what we see is any time we land into a large enterprise, for example \u2013 and we're going to start in the cloud environment. Their on-prem environments are going to have a collection of other things. They're going to have older infrastructure monitors like the BMCs and [indiscernible] of the world. They're going to have older ATMs. They're going to have Splunk and Elastic somewhere in on-prem as well. It's a given. But we're not going to displace that from day one. We're going to be a solution that are going to be in environment and we're going to displace those products as the customers reach critical mass in the cloud, and this starts standardizing.  So we \u2013 but we think from what we see, the customers that are doing that today are the ones who are far along in their cloud migration and started that one like a few years ago. So we think this is going to be low in the years to come. Today, it's still a product that is being adopted by customers when they already let at our customers that we don't \u2013 we really land with it first. And that's by design, right? That's \u2013 as we keep developing it, and we keep making it applicable to a broader set of customers. We are starting though \u2013 we're getting to the point where soon we'll have the full V1 of our cloud security platform. I think for that, we're still missing the general availability of the application security component. Once we have that, I think we look into accelerating the go-to-market side a little bit and maybe doing some of the specialization we've been discussing earlier in this call, but we haven't done that yet. Yes. So we do \u2013 so first of all, I mean, we \u2013 I mean, yes, customers see us differently over time. I mean we are definitely \u2013 like we're becoming one of the platforms that they are going to standardize big points of their business around, and that's definitely a different relationship with them than just something some people on their team are using. So that's the change we see. And we see across a large number of our customers. Now in terms of pursuing the \u2013 larger deal, I mean, we do have different ways of structuring our teams internally so that we have folks that are going after new logos that might be smaller, folks that are going after growth of reaching customers, folks that are going after the growth of the very biggest customers. And we have some segmentation internally on that, and we'll have more and more segmentation as we grow as we need to focus a little bit every one. But we're still not looking for those very large deals. We do them today when our customers want them. When they need the \u2013 for their own planning purposes. And when they want to commit their own organizations, we'll do those deals for them. But this is not something that we actively seek. Our product and we've seen throughout the year that our product is very sticky, and then our product grows very well with our customers. So there's no point on our end in pushing for very large, very long-term deals. And I think on these good words, I think we'll close the call. So I want to thank you all for this \u2013 for sticking with us to the call. We're all very happy obviously with the performance this quarter, which is all thanks to the team at Datadog and Datadog's worldwide and their hard work. And so I want to congratulate against everyone, and thank everyone for a job very, very well done. And we'll see you all next quarter. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q3. Revenue was $270 million, up 75% year-over-year and up 16% quarter-over-quarter. Usage trends were strong, and showed broad-based growth. Customers continuing to adopt more products across the platform, and new logo generation was also strong. To provide some more context. First, growth of existing customers was robust in Q3, and our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 17th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was very strong, driven by customers' expanded usage of existing products and the adoption of new products. Our new customers from the last several quarters have expanded their usage quite rapidly, and we had some significant renewals with large customers in Q3. We also had a record quarter of ARR adds, including record ARR adds in all of our major products. And we saw strong growth across geographical regions, with all regions accelerated on a year-over-year basis compared to Q2. New logo results were also strong. Our enterprise and commercial sales teams had a crisp execution in this quarter, and new logo ARR was up strongly year-over-year. We continue to see opportunities broadly across industries and customer sizes. Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. And as we mentioned, 77% of our customers are now using two or more products, and 31% of our customers are using four or more products. And lastly, churn remained low and in line with historical levels. Our dollar-based gross retention rate remained unchanged in the mid-90s and is similar across all our customer segments and products. Turning to billings. The billings were $309 million, up 98% year-over-year. There were no pro forma impacts in the quarter. Note that we called out shorter-term billings duration in Q3 2020 last year. And billing duration in 3Q of this year is in line with recent quarters, but is higher on a year-over-year basis, driving higher year-over-year billings growth. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $719 million, up 127% year-over-year driven by strong sales activity, increased contract duration, and it was growing against an easier compare in the third quarter of last year. The increase in contract duration was driven by several large renewals with multiyear terms. As a reminder, multiyear commitments are built annually, and we don't incentivize our sales team towards multiyear deals. Current RPO growth was about 100% year-over-year as our mix shifted away from month-to-month deals to \u2013 on a year-over-year basis more towards semiannual and annual. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now, let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Starting with gross profit. Our gross profit in the quarter was $210 million, representing a gross margin of 78%. This compares to a gross margin of 76% last quarter and 79% in the year ago quarter. Due to our continued efforts to drive efficiencies in cloud costs, we expect our gross margin to increase sequentially in Q4. In the mid-to long term, we expect gross margin to remain in the high 70s range, typical of our historical performance. R&D expense was $84 million or 31% of revenue compared to 30% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest significantly in R&D, including high growth in our engineering headcount. Sales and marketing expense was $65 million or 24% of revenue compared to 32% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see strong efficiencies with our frictionless land-and-expand selling motion. We also had relatively few in-person events in Q3, but we continue to plan for increased travel and events cost going forward depending on local health and travel guidelines. G&A expense was $17 million or 6% of revenues compared to 8% in the year ago quarter. Operating income was $44 million or a 16% operating margin compared to an operating income of $14 million or 9% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest heavily against the large and dynamic market opportunity we see in front of us. But our product innovation, coupled with a strong go-to-market effort and a frictionless land-and-expand model is driving strong revenue growth and business model efficiencies. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $44 million or $0.13 per share based on 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $67 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $57 million for a free cash flow margin of 21%. Now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2021. We remain highly optimistic about our long-term opportunities, and we continue to work hard to execute against these opportunities. Taking this into account with the usual conservatism applied, we are updating our guidance as follows. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $290 million to $292 million, which represents 64% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $38 million to $40 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be between $0.11 and $0.12 per share based on 347 million average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year 2021, revenue is expected to be in the range of 293 to \u2013 sorry, $993 million to $995 million, which represents a 65% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $113 million to $135 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.39 per share to $0.40 per share based on approximately 344 million weighted average shares outstanding. Now some notes on guidance. while usage growth remained strong in Q3, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions. We would note that we typically see slower business activity towards the end of the fourth quarter as employees take vacations around the winter holidays. Next, our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for the long-term growth, and our model assumes greater expenses related to travel and in-person events going forward. However, we will remain flexible depending upon local regulations and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees. Regarding items below operating income, we expect approximately $0.7 million of Q4 non-GAAP net interest and other income, which includes interest income on our cash and marketable securities and the interest expense of our convertible debt. We do not expect to be a federal taxpayer, but of a tax provision related to international entities, we expect that tax provision to be approximately $600,000 in Q4 and $2 million for the full year. And now to summarize, we are very pleased with the results of this quarter. Our platform is resonating in the marketplace, and we saw strong performance across our products in Q3. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D. And with the launch of database monitoring and CI visibility, we now have 13 generally available products to offer our customers. Our execution against our go-to-market goals remain strong. And our ability to help our customers manage through their cloud migration and digital transformation efforts continues to expand. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. And we continue to have our usage increase be about two-thirds, usage of products the client had already, and about one-third adoption of new products. That's been pretty consistent over time. So, we continue to see similar types of adoption path. What we said in billings duration was we had large \u2013 generally been in sort of the seven months plus or minus then we had, had some contraction when in COVID last year down into the sixes. And now we're back up into that same range on billings duration that we had before in sort of the seven to eight months. The same thing happened in contract duration. Although the contract duration, we said was complemented by multiyear contracts, which expanded the RPO in this quarter, and maybe a bit unique in terms of the number of multiyear's that happened this quarter. Yes. I think we said that similar to previous quarters, about two-thirds of our growth. And that's comparing the size of the customer today versus the previous year comes from \u2013 has come from expansion of their use of products that they had already bought. And about one-third has come from their adoption of the new products, and that's been pretty consistent over time. So that's how that splits. I think it's a combination of a number of things at the same time, strong lands over a number of quarters, which then began to use the product and accelerate \u2013 acceleration of budgets around cloud migration, which caused the usage to increase, and continue to be strong, and cross-sell of other products as our product suite gets adopted and the success there, more of the products as we showed are getting adopted by the clients. So the combination of all of those at the same time and strength geographically across all the regions caused the acceleration from last year's post-COVID type of results. No. We \u2013 I think we said in the script that even though we've gone \u2013 we've had some more multi years, there's still annual billing at most. We don't go for financing the company through collecting events. So there really is very little, as we talked about, long-term change in the billing dynamics. In terms of cash flow, we tend to see a little bit of seasonality at the end of the year when we go through our sales \u2013 end of the year sales cycle and then collect in the first quarter. But I wouldn't see too much change in the cash flow dynamics from either the longer duration of contracts or seasonality."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us for our morning call today. We are very pleased with our performance in Q2, which was stronger than expected on robust growth with existing customers as well as strong new customer sales. We saw real strength both across product lines and across customer segments. For a quick review of the quarter, revenue was $234 million, an increase of 67% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,610 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,015 in the year ago quarter. Those customers generate about 80% of our ARR. We have about 16,400 customers, which is up from about 12,100 last year. We also continued to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $42 million. And our dollar-based net retention rates continued to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. We are pleased that positive business trends from recent quarters continued in Q2. First, usage growth from existing customers remained very robust. Among other factors, we continued to see the impact of our strong new logo growth in the past several quarters as those new customers grow into their commitment. Second, new logo ARR was again strong and we continued to execute against our go-to-market strategy. And third, churn continues to remain low and in line with historical rates. Taking all these factors into account, we had a very strong quarter of ARR added with over $100 million of ARR added for the second consecutive quarter. Next, our platform strategy continued to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 75% of customers are using 2 or more products, up from 68% a year ago.  Additionally, 28% of customers are now using 4 or more products, which is up from 15% last year. And this quarter, approximately 70% of new logos landed with 2 or more products. Our platform saw strong growth in the second quarter, which included another record of ARR added for infrastructure monitoring in a single quarter. This product is still early in its fast cycle. Meanwhile, we continued to see very strong performance with other products in our platform. Our APM suite, including RUM and Synthetics and log management, together, reached over $400 million in ARR. The APM suite and log management also remained in hyper growth mode, but our newer other products are growing even faster. As a result, we are very pleased with the customer uptake of our end-to-end observability platform as well as the beginning of our Cloud Security Platform. Now let's move on to product and R&D. Our teams continued to innovate and solve customer pain points. We announced 73 new features in Q2 and have continued to ship in Q3. To discuss just a few of these, we announced the general availability of 2 new security products, Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud Workload Security, which target security issues around infrastructure. Cloud Security Posture Management runs continuous configuration audit so customers can track environments to industry benchmarks and regulatory standards. And Cloud Workload Security performs real-time threat detection directly within the workloads themselves within hosts and containers. These are our second and third GA products in security, alongside Security Monitoring, which performs a threat detection on events and loading data streams. With these offerings, the first building blocks of our Cloud Security Platform are coming together, and we can start delivering on our vision to break down silos between DevOps and security teams. And with the addition of these 2 products, we now have 11 GA products on the Datadog platform. We are also at the beginning of our opportunity to bring observability to the CI/CD space, and we announced the beta of our CI Visibility product in late July. CI/CD is a combined practice of continuous integration and continuous delivery, allowing software to be consistently written, tested and released to production. The problem is that developers also don't have visibility into their CI/CD pipelines. They have a hard time figuring out if tests are failing and why and where in their CI/CD pipeline they are experiencing bottlenecks and issues. Our CI Visibility product, based on our acquisition of Undefined Labs last August, helps customers gain visibility into their testing pipeline with the goal of lowering costs and increasing efficiency for their developer teams. So we are excited about these announcements, but we're not standing still on our existing products and we'll continue to expand features to make each and every one best-of-breed. In Synthetics, we have enabled cross-product testing and our customers can now test on Microsoft Edge and Firefox in addition to Chrome. Mobile RUM will now support Android, iOS and cross-platform frameworks like React Native. Our RUM product now covers the whole user space, including RUM applications on desktop, mobile and tablets as well as mobile apps. And finally, we continue to improve the AI/ML capabilities of our platform with our most recent addition, including automatic detection of faulty deployments in APM and anomaly detection in Security Monitoring. These are complemented by the continued extension of Watchdog Insights, the recommendation engine we are embedding directly into our users' workflows across our platform. As you can see, our end-to-end observability platform continues to broaden and deepen. Meanwhile, we are beginning to see -- to move forward in our cloud security, and we are in the early days with our CI/CD use cases. As always, I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their creativity, their productivity and their continued ability to deliver the right solutions to our customers' problems. Now moving on to sales and marketing. As hinted by our customer growth this quarter, our go-to-market teams continued to be very productive. So let's discuss some more Q2 wins. First, we had an 8-figure upsell with a next-gen financial services company, which is experiencing a surge of traffic in their core application. They rely on Datadog log management as the platform across the organization to find the root cause of issues. They saw a significant increase in usage of our existing product and recently added our Continuous Profiler to better understand their good performance in production. Next, we had a 7-figure up-sell with a European e-commerce company. They were using multiple commercial observability tools, and one of their 2021 strategic initiatives was to consolidate and reduce costs by standardizing on Datadog to satisfy that goal while improving their team's collaboration and communication. Next, we had a 7-figure upsell with a large global accounting firm. This company is experiencing rapid growth with their online product and its teams were forced to jump from tool to tool to try and mitigate problems. With Datadog as their chosen solution for infrastructure monitoring, APM and Synthetics, they are able to decrease mean time to resolution and free up internal resources. Next, we had a 6-figure upsell with a 30-years-old analytics software company. This company is moving more workload to Azure. With this new upsell, they standardized on Datadog for their log management needs. With our Logging without Limits functionality, this company will lower costs by an order of magnitude for log management without sacrificing any of their log data. And finally, we had a 7-figure land with a large back-office software company. This company is growing rapidly and is planning a move to hybrid cloud. But their previous monitoring adoption rate was very low, which made it difficult for their teams to collaborate. With Datadog, their entire team now has a single platform for all their operability needs, and they recognize Datadog's impact on improving adoption and alignment across teams. So as you can tell, we are incredibly proud of the performance of our go-to-market team this quarter, and I want to thank them for their hard work and for partnering with our customers to deliver another quarter of strong results. Now moving on to our longer-term outlook. We see businesses now moving forward with their longer-term digital strategy. Businesses must increasingly be digital first. Azure platforming remains in its early stages, and we believe we are in a great position to help our customers with our Unified Observability platform. Meanwhile, we are making progress on our long-term vision to break down silos between DevOps and security teams. As a result, we are extremely excited about the opportunities we see to democratize data and help customers increase visibility and manage complexity. And we're confident in our long-term plans and continue to work hard to execute on our strategy. Before turning the call over to David, I want to mention that our teams are busy preparing for Dash 2021, our user conference, which will be held in late October this year. Every year at Dash, we showcase our latest product innovations and we're excited to show everyone what we've been up to this year. We also expect to hold an investor session at Dash. So please look out for that announcement in the fall. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. David?\nDavid Obstler : Thanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q2. Revenue was $233.5 million, up 67% year-over-year and up 18% quarter-over-quarter. Usage trends were strong and showed broad-based growth. New logo generation was also strong and customers continued to adopt more products across the platform. To provide some more context. First, growth of existing customers was again robust in Q2 and our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 16th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was strong, driven by customers' expanded usage of existing products and the adoption of new products. Our customers are continuing to pursue their cloud migrations. And as we expand with our customers, we see opportunities for them to standardize on us and consolidate their observability tool vendors. Next, we saw a -- we saw for the second consecutive quarter of ARR adds over $100 million with broad strength across product lines, including our newer products, and strength across our regions. New logos were also very strong. We had a record number of both gross and net new logo additions in the quarter. Both our enterprise and commercial sales teams executed strongly in the quarter, and we continued to see broad opportunities across industries and customer size. Remember, that our -- given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue, but do so over time. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. And 70% of our customers are now using 2 or more products and 28% of our customers are now using 4 or more of our products. Lastly, churn remained low, in line with historical levels. Our dollar-based gross retention rates remained unchanged in the mid-90s and they are similar across our customer segments and products. Billings were $270 million, up 69% year-over-year. And there were no pro forma impacts in the quarter. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $583 million, up 103% year-over-year driven by strong sales activity and increased contract duration. The increase in contract duration was driven by a higher mix of annual and multiyear commitments relative to the year ago quarter. As a reminder, multiyear commitments are billed annually and we do not incentivize our sales force towards multiyear deals. Current RPO growth was also strong at over 80% year-over-year. I should note that we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $178 million, representing a gross margin of 76%. This compares to a gross margin of 77% last quarter and 80% in the year ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was due to investments in our product and platform innovation. We expect gross margin in the mid- to long term to be consistent with our historical performance. R&D expense was $71 million or 30% of revenue compared to 27% in the year ago quarter. We continued to invest significantly in R&D, including high growth of our engineering head count. We're pleased that we are successfully executing on our hiring and onboarding plans in R&D. Sales and marketing expense was $61 million or 26% of revenue compared to 33% in the year ago quarter. We continued to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but revenue growth has outpaced our investment growth. We had only a few in-person events in Q2, but we continue to plan for increased travel and event costs later in this year, of course, depending on local health and travel guidelines. G&A expense was $16 million or 7% of revenue, down from 9% in the year ago quarter. Operating income was $31 million or a 13% operating margin compared to the operating income of $15 million or an 11% operating margin in the year ago quarter. Although strong in the quarter, we are not optimizing for near-term margins as we see a large and dynamic market opportunity in front of us, and we are striving to invest heavily against that opportunity. But Q2, of course, demonstrates the efficiencies of our business model. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $32 million or $0.09 per share on 342 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $52 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $42 million with a free cash flow margin of 18%. Now for our outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2021. We are optimistic about our long-term opportunities and believe we will deliver high growth for the foreseeable future. We are addressing a very large market and are executing well against that opportunity. Taking this into account with the usual conservatism applied, we are updating our guidance as follows: for the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $246 million to $248 million, which represents a 60% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $18 million to $20 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.06 per share based on approximately 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And then for the full year 2021, revenue is expected to be in the range of $938 million to $944 million, which represents a 56% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $87 million to $93 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 per share based on an approximate 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now some notes on our guidance. First, while usage growth was strong in Q2, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions. Second, our strategic focus remains on investing to optimize for long-term growth. We are planning for continued aggressive investments in R&D and go-to-market through the remainder of 2021. And next, our model assumes a return to the office and the resumption of travel and in-person events during Q3. That said, we will remain flexible depending upon local regulations and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees. Regarding items below the operating income line, first, we expect approximately $0.9 million of Q3 non-GAAP net interest and other income, which includes the interest income on our cash and marketable securities and the interest expense on our convertible debt. We do not expect to be a federal taxpayer in Q3, but have a tax provision related to our international entity. And as a result, we expect a tax provision of approximately $600,000 in Q3 and $2 million for the full year. To summarize, we are very pleased with our results this quarter. Customers continue to consume more Datadog, both using more of their existing products and choosing to begin using new products. We added 2 new products this quarter and now have 11 products to offer to our customers. Our execution against our R&D and go-to-market goals remain strong. And our ability to help customers to manage through their cloud migration and digital transformation effects continues to grow. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: If you could maybe provide a little more color on the large customer growth. The last 2 quarters, you had exceptional results in that segment. Maybe if you can just give us a little more color on what you're seeing as these larger enterprises are standardizing on your platform?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So we're still seeing some of those. I mean, I think some of those -- what we mentioned in the call in that category where customers were using something else before a collection of different things and they're standardizing on our platform and -- which creates a larger land for us. But that's still not the vast majority of our customer acquisition. By and large, we're still starting with smaller customers and going with them and then they standardize with us later on as they're further down the road in their migration to cloud environment. So we feel -- we see some of that in the proportion that is comparable to what we've seen in different quarters, but we don't see any particular trend there yet.\nBrent Thill: And David, just in terms of the sales hiring plan that you have in the second half versus the first half, can you give us just some color on your quota-carrying capacity and what you're expecting to add by half of the year?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. As we said previously, we're trying to grow our ramp quota approximately in line with revenues. And we had, as we said, throughout COVID last year and this year, we have aggressive hiring plans, which we are executing on. And we haven't changed our sort of goals for hiring and quota expansion throughout the last couple of years.\nOlivier Pomel : Just to rebound what David just said, we \u2013 unlike many companies that have stops and starts, we kept hiring steadily, which put us in a great position today. Right now, it\u2019s an interesting time for hiring because the job market is very hot and there\u2019s also many people taking some time off. So it\u2019s a lot of effort to grow at the level at which we want, but we\u2019re happy with the place we\u2019re in and we\u2019re very happy we made the choice to keep steadily recruiting throughout the pandemic.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh : Congrats on the impressive Q2 results. Olivier, what are the -- see if I can get a little more understanding of a comment you made in your script around infrastructure monitoring still being in its early days. From your perspective, what drives that sort of sentiment around infrastructure monitoring? It's been your core product that was sort of the foundation of the company and you're saying that there's still a long runway ahead. Can you just expound upon that line of thinking a little bit?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. I mean there's 2 aspects to it. One is in terms of penetration, I think the intersection of what we have and what's in the cloud in the next year is still a small fraction of what there is in the market total. So there's a lot more we can get from that. The second aspect is that the world is transforming digitally so the market, like the overall -- the size of the infrastructure that will have to be monitored probably is a lot bigger than what had to be monitored 5 years ago. So when you look at those 2 things, there's a lot more ground to cover in terms of those market penetration and so how much stuff we can cover with infrastructure monitoring. In parallel to that, it's a field that is still evolving, right? There's still -- the name of the game in the cloud is that there are ways of innovation and new ways of running workloads. And we've been through a few of those in Datadog. We started with cloud incentives and then containers and now serverless. We don't expect that to stop there. We think there's going to be new modalities for running infrastructure. And so we're investing heavily in our products to be at the forefront of all that.\nSanjit Singh : Makes total sense. And as a follow-up, I think one of the words that I heard multiple times in your script was standardization and what we've been hearing from customers is that APM has really come into its own. How much of a driver has that been? And where would you put sort of the log analytics solution in terms of its maturity? They came out of a year or 2 later after APM. Where does that capability and product stand from your perspective if we use APM as an analogy?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, I love all my children the same. The APM and logs are neck and neck in terms of the adoption across our customer base and I would say the level of maturity. Both products win in situations where we're starting with those products in the back-of-grid kind of setup by customers. And they both can serve as the second leg of the stool in managing to infrastructure to be the basis for standardization for customers. And so what we see today, we've proven at meaningful scale is that customers are standardizing on our offering. They buy into the platform. And the 3 main legs of that stool are going to be APM, logs and infrastructure monitoring.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty : Given the number of comments that you talked about, usage in the prepared remarks is helping drive strength. Can you maybe just spend a quick minute talking through -- remember, we had the overages item in kind of the first half of last year. How is this different? And how is the kind of usage and consumption growing now?\nDavid Obstler: I'll take that. I think what we said was we had a flattening and an optimization in Q2 of last year. And since that time, which is now Q3 of last year through now, we've had a return to more normal or consistent with the long-term trends. And we continue to see that in Q2, a very strong and similar quarter to what we've seen in the last 3, 4 quarters and very consistent with the company's long-term positions in that. And that is reflective, we feel, of a return to normal in the rolling out of cloud migrations and digital projects. And so like we said in previous quarters, the usage growth was very widespread, balanced in products and types of customers, very similar to what we've seen in the history of the company.\nSterling Auty: All right. Great. And then one quick follow-up. In terms of the investment in go-to-market, when you gave guidance for this quarter, I think similar items. Obviously, sales and marketing came in well below what, I think, ours and most forecasts had. Can you help give us a sense how much of the sequential increase that is baked into the guidance is from head count versus, as you pointed out, the return to office and the travel?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. Let me start with that. So we said all along that we have 2 drivers. One is in terms of sort of percentage of revenue in the marketing and sort of travel, sort of 3% or so \u2013 3%-plus is sort of a benefit from not having that travel and the event. That does have some volatility depending upon whether you\u2019re in a quarter where you have re:Invent and Dash, which is what we\u2019re having in Q4. Net, I think we\u2019ve performed, as you can see on the \u2013 in the revenue line sort of above where we were planning. So essentially, we had a positive surprise in the revenues and that sort of drops down to the bottom line. And secondly \u2013 and lastly, as Oli mentioned, we have very aggressive hiring plans. We are essentially trying to get that done this year. It takes a while to get that done in this market. And so we expect that growth to accelerate, that sort of people side of things, to accelerate in the second half of the year. And we\u2019re already seeing that in our hiring numbers. But we have, over the last couple of years, sort of ramped up into our hiring during the course of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Congratulations on extraordinary results. Really awesome to see this, Oli and David. My question is as you really start to experience the benefits of standardization, what are the sales cycles looking like? And how do we expect the kind of hiring that you do to prosecute these options, which are showing up in the pipeline? And if you could, as a result, talk about how this gets Datadog into the upper end of the enterprise market as things evolve over the next couple of years, that would be great. And also, if you do have the time to answer this, as the economy -- if the economy opens up, your results are fantastic as they are. What could be the incremental benefit of the opening up of the economy when we get to travel and get out there?\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. So I\u2019ll start with the standardization. At this point, it doesn\u2019t change our sales cycles too much because the way we do it is it mostly starts small and we grow with customers. And then by the time we standardize, we have a solid foothold at that customer and their engineers are using us all the time and it gets increasingly easier to make the case for standardization. Obviously, there\u2019s going to be some changes over time as we cover more and more of the globe with our sales force and that we have customers that have more and more years with us, you know that, right? I do expect to make some changes over the time to the way we operate. But at this point, there\u2019s no major tweaks to the sales process or the time it takes. It does -- the standardization does inform a road map from a product perspective because we are investing more and more in technologies that are not necessarily plug-centric. And we\u2019re doing that in order to help our customers who standardize bring some of their legacy IT or on-prem IT back into the \u2013 under the same or most of their cloud technology. So this is something really that informs that part of our development. And it will also, in all likelihood, inform some of our efforts around professional services and spending more time bringing those customers across. On the question on the opening of the economy, I mean, look, we \u2013 what\u2019s interesting to us is that it looks like the \u2013 we\u2019re back to the way the world would move into the cloud more or less before the pandemic. And we don\u2019t know if things can go any faster. There seems to be some \u2013 there was a very steady historical trend for us there and we\u2019re back to that steady historical trend, so we\u2019re happy with that. So the main thing that we\u2019re working on right now to maintain long-term growth is make sure that we keep building on the platform so we can add more products, cover the full \u2013 solve the full problem or increasingly large part of the problem for our customers, while at the same time, scaling the go-to-market teams so we can be in all of the conversations everywhere in the world for our customer segments. And we still have quite a bit of work to do in order to achieve that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tyler Radke from Citi.\nTyler Radke: I wanted to ask you just about the pricing environment broadly. Obviously, a year ago, kind of in the depths of COVID, you saw some customers rationalize spend. Obviously, it didn't seem like that was an issue this quarter. But just how do you feel kind of longer term about your pricing strategy? And as you continue to innovate and build out new features, do you feel like you could potentially have that pricing power to charge even more over time?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So I think there's 3 parts to that answer. The first one is what we saw last year was not price pressure. What we saw last year was customers really seeing their [indiscernible] footprint with Amazon and Azure and the others. And these were the customers with the largest deals because they saw this greatly could still save money when they were facing a lot of uncertainty around cash and that we pulled to us. That's one. Two, when you think long term, the -- it's almost a given that there will need to be a different way of charging for some of the -- for capturing some of the value provided to customers that can't just be attached to the straight volumes of data that are being exchanged because those volume of data are exploding exponentially while our customers' revenues are not going to explode exponentially. So that's one thing that we're working on with all of our products. We have this denomination for all of our products that is without limits, which is basically a way to align the value customers get with the price they pay and give them leverage for that and make sure that we keep unbundling things on our end. So we would give them the power to do that. The third answer to that question is that over time we made the choice to add new functionality largely in the form of new SKUs when they saw new classes of problems for our customers, which is a way basically to maintain price and increase price as we grow and as we see the functionality. We like the fact that it also gives us very good signal in terms of the value these products provide and helps drive the road map of those products.\nTyler Radke: And just a follow-up on the competitive environment, Oli. I think you talked about just how customers are consolidating observability tools or maybe you kind of see that opportunity. Just as you've seen more of that, and obviously, the deal sizes have been really, really healthy this quarter, especially around the RPO growth, are you seeing kind of more kind of legacy observability solution replacements? Just help us understand as those deal sizes grow, what that means competitively for you guys.\nOlivier Pomel : It\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve seen before. And the motion is really on-prem or legacy that is being consolidated into the cloud. That\u2019s what we see. So we see the same trend that we\u2019ve seen in the past, there\u2019s nothing \u2013 there\u2019s no other very interesting comment to make about that today. We see what we still see.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg: Oli, obviously, you talked a little bit in your script about really building security portfolio of solutions. Obviously, a little different buyer than sort of core -- sort of your core infrastructure or even logging products for that matter. Can you talk about sort of how you're building out the sales motion there and really how you see additional leverage there?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So the sales motion there is very much built on -- for now and what we had with observability. And as we're building those products, we're leaning on those customers that are already brought into the Datadog platform and that can self-select to start adopting from our security products. So that's step one. Step two will be as more and more of those products reach GA and reach the financial critical mass to actually start pushing them more directly through the sales force. I think for that, we're actually learning quite a bit from the Sqreen acquisition we've done recently. And we expect that, that will have some interesting things to do in the future. We don't have anything specific to share today, though.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. Okay. And then, David, one for you. You noted in the call that you had a higher level of multiyear commitments. And obviously, we realize you don't necessarily push for that. Just wondering, what were some of the customer conversations that drove that behavior?\nDavid Obstler: I think it has a correlation to larger customers who are investing more in Datadog as their standardized observability and want to commit long term. It generally is pulled from the client rather than we go out. Remember, when land and expand, we often see the motion of growing over time and amending contracts with more commitment. So this is really more of a factor of enterprise customers and larger cloud natives committing to Datadog as a core platform and wanting that commitment to be longer term.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair.\nKamil Mielczarek: Congrats on the incredible quarter. So it's great to hear about the platform expansion. So you embedded 2 offerings. You have Datadog Dash coming up in a few months and yet research and development expense, I believe, is up 84% year-to-date. Can you give us more detail around the decision to accelerate the level of R&D spend? And how should we think about the pace of new product introductions? And given the increasing diversity of your offerings, what changes do you need to make to the sales organization to support the sale of these new solutions?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. We're investing as aggressively as we can on all fronts. So we -- when we have opportunities to accelerate the investment in R&D, which we've done through a few acquisitions also and these actually largely show up in our R&D expenses on an ongoing basis, so we're doing it. We still think we are very early in what's a very, very, very large opportunity across observability, security and we mentioned today also some of the developer use cases around CI/CD. But also, later on, there's a lot of things we can do in real-time BI, maybe in [indiscernible]. Lots of different things we can touch on. So we're very early. We intend to keep investing heavily in R&D for a very long time. In terms of the impact on the go-to-market, really where we'll see the first need for some changes in the -- on the go-to-market side is as we stop pushing the sell side of the security product more aggressively. It hasn't happened yet. It's not something that we're doing today as those products just barely reached GA for a few of them, but it's something that we'll certainly do in the future. So nothing to share today on that, but it's definitely something that we're working on.\nKamil Mielczarek: That's great to hear. And quickly, can you just give me an update on the competitive backdrop? Is there any change in who you're seeing on deals? And have win rates improved? And how might that vary by product?\nOlivier Pomel: So it\u2019s very boring. We see the same thing as before. From where we stand, the company\u2019s landscape hasn\u2019t changed. And our focus is still mostly greenfield, new environments, teams that are going to start small with us and are going to grow with us until they standardize on us for just about everything they do. That\u2019s the motion, hasn\u2019t changed and/or the landscape around us hasn\u2019t changed that much either.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Reback from Stifel.\nBrad Reback: As we think about new customer growth in the platform, is the recent cohort of new adds growing into their commitments faster? So are they ramping faster than customers a couple of years ago?\nOlivier Pomel: So it depends a little bit because we also have some larger commitments on day 1 than we used to. We mentioned that in the previous -- on the first few calls. So overall, the cohorts are longer, they start larger. The ASPs are going up over time generally. And -- but the growth we see is very commensurate with what we've seen in the past in terms of growth in usage on the first month they're with us to the 6 months and 12 months and everything. So it's a 2-part event there.\nDavid Obstler : Broadly speaking, when you look at the consistency of the net retention and the longevity of it, it\u2019s still very, very similar in the land and expand with cohorts expanding similar to previous periods, and very importantly, expanding for a long time. So they last \u2013 the cohort expansion continues on for quite a long time, which is very consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in previous periods.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jack Andrews from Needham.\nJack Andrews : Congratulations on the results. Oli, I was wondering as you continue to push more into security, what are the lessons learned from the previous conversions of the dev and ops personas that could be applied to gaining traction in DevSecOps? And how is this conversion to security perhaps different than when dev and ops merged that you need to account for?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So it's a great question. There's a lot of commonality in that. A lot of it is about reducing friction and making things that otherwise we go out, look around with a lot of effort and a lot of different people involved and a lot of different departments involved to be very easy and that we can do early on. And so that's -- we know how to do that. That's what we've done throughout the history of the company and so that's the first part. The second part, though, is that the buyer is a little bit different, and in some cases, a buyer might need to be addressed a little bit differently. And that's something a few other of the questions touched upon earlier, so I won't repeat myself too much there, but it's still something that we're working on in terms of how we add that to the motion we have for setting the platform.\nJack Andrews: And then just as a quick follow-up. Again, when we think about the broadening portfolio of your solutions, could you just update us in terms of just how you're keeping your sales force and your partner ecosystem just up to speed with their ability to understand the value propositions and the nuances of everything that you are offering these days?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So it\u2019s a major effort. The \u2013 it\u2019s actually one of the areas, Adam, who joined us as the Chief Operating Officer recently. It\u2019s going to be his major area of focus today is to make sure that we scale the team that does enablement and that teaches everyone on the sales team and all the go-to-market teams with the product offering, even how it works and who to bring in into every single deals, that we understand exactly how to match the right product to the right customer. So that\u2019s one of his major areas of focus. So we\u2019re investing in that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: Great quarter. Oli, I want to follow up on the security questions and really talk about the 2 new announcements you've made: the posture management and workload protection. There isn't a security vendor at this point that doesn't have those solutions available as well. So even though the market is early, it seems like everybody is chasing this. Maybe you can help me think about what differentiation you can bring into the security space from your perspective? And also, I know it's still early, but perhaps maybe you could talk about the ARR contribution of your Cloud Security Platform at this point?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So on the second one, I mean, we don\u2019t have anything to share here yet. We\u2019re actually \u2013 the only thing I can say is we\u2019re very happy with the way it\u2019s trending and the way it\u2019s growing. And we\u2019ll probably share some more at some point, but we don\u2019t have anything to say today. On the differentiation, what we\u2019d bring to those categories, we already are instrumenting all those workloads. So we are present on those machines. Our agents are running there. The logs are being collected by us already. We already connect to all those cloud configuration. So there\u2019s nothing else to be done really by our customers to turn on security, and that\u2019s a major, major differentiator. And we also have all the developers and all the ops people that are watching what we do all day. And they can get \u2013 they can teach the security team as well. They can be part of the solution as opposed to living in a separate silo from the security team. They are tasked with securing those workloads. So when you combine those 2 things, I think we have something that\u2019s very powerful, very different and I would say almost impossible for the competition that comes solely from instrumenting the workload from a security perspective to replicate.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Turits from KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: First, obviously, a great quarter. The pricing discussion, so you talked, Oli, a little bit about the need to change pricing at some point. There has been in the market already some changes from some of the competitors in their pricing, which does seem aimed at commoditizing usage of data in particular. Has that had any kind of impact in terms of competition? And how does that relate to some of your thoughts about what you would do with pricing long term?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, it's -- we've seen some of that in the market, but it hasn't had any impact on us directly. But I should say that we are investing and we have been investing a lot in new models for charging customers and putting them in control of their spend and making sure that we align with the value adjustments of all data volumes they're producing. And that's a lot of what our without limit offerings are doing. We started with that for logs. We're also doing more and more for APM and infrastructure, and that's something that our customers subscribe to when they standardize on us. And we've mentioned that on the call, some of our customers are able to slash their spending on logs, in particular, because they can spend on what matters to them. They can get over there. They can categorize and retain it. We can only index some of it for some of the very specific purposes they need. They can make direct queryable on demand if they want it, like they can do anything they want. We'll give them all the levers and all the flexibility for that so that their bill doesn't grow linearly with their data volume. So that's something we've already been investing in. So it's not a big change for us, just a continuation of what we've been doing.\nMichael Turits: And then, Oli, you made an interesting point about legacy -- investment in R&D for a legacy replacement. I mean we've done some of that in the past. So what do you need to do from an R&D or product perspective to enable that? And are we at the point where that could unlock an upgrade cycle that would be very important to you?\nOlivier Pomel : I mean right now, we're still early in that, too. I mean we're connecting to all sorts of noncloud equipment, so network equipment -- physical network equipment, power distribution units, that sort of stuff. And we'll do more and more of it until we reach a point where a significant part of the market is maturing up in the cloud that it's time for them to standardize. Today, I would say that the customers that standardize and bring their legacy IT into the cloud are still the ones that are at the fore -- or we're are the forefront of their cloud migration to start with their leading edge. So there are signs of things to come, not that we are at that space just yet.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: I'll echo my congratulations on a very strong quarter. I guess the first question, just regarding the Cloud Security Platform. In addition to a la carte, is the plan to offer CSPM, CWS, Security Monitoring and app security as a suite as well?\nOlivier Pomel: There will likely be a few pricing options there. I mean we haven't communicated any of that yet, but we're thinking hard about the various ways these products can be packaged.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. And then, Oli, one of your competitors recently spoke about a large uplift in the number of deals closed with their hyperscaler partners such as AWS and Azure. Can you update us on your cloud partnerships and the go-to-market activity that you're seeing there?\nOlivier Pomel: So we still continued to do with what we\u2019ve been doing before. So we\u2019re getting more and more from those cloud partnerships, and all of these cloud partnerships are developing more and more. We really see on the GCP marketplace recently, where there is \u2013 it makes it easier for customers to deploy or partnership with Azure has taken another step forward recently also as we\u2019ve been integrated directly to the console. There\u2019s still a few parts of that partnership that needs to be implemented. So we\u2019re still not completely done yet, but there\u2019s still \u2013 we\u2019re still making progress on that. And we\u2019re also working on deeper partnerships with AWS. So it\u2019s happening across the board and the things are trending in the right direction. And at this point, this is not a major part of our success, I would say it\u2019s more of a potential upside for the future.\nOperator: And our next question is from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow : Can you hear me okay?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay. Perfect. Congrats from me as well. Olivier, can you talk -- going towards CI/CD now, obviously like it's a whole new market, but not my people have really come there before. Like can you talk a little bit about like how this will play out for you? How big the opportunity is? Like how important it is? In theory is like that's where everything starts, but like I never thought about it from a monitoring or observability perspective.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So it's interesting. It's very early. We know the product space is very big because engineers spend a lot of time wrestling with testing and deploying. And so we know it's spending a lot of time and spending involved there. It's interesting to us because it pushes the boundary of where we operate also and we get closer and more clearly embedded into the developer workflows, what happens on their laptop where they write improvement in the break and test loops on their own environment before they reach even development of steady environment. So it's very interesting to us for that reason. It's more of a massive category in terms of observing and optimizing those environments. So we'll have to see exactly what the market opportunity is there, but we know the problem space is very large.\nRaimo Lenschow : Yes. Okay, perfect. And then one question for David. You were 130 NRR number. You remember last year when the number kind of came down a little bit, you mentioned it. Just -- and I know you're not going to give me a number, but like trend-wise, is the number trending higher now? Is there a lag effect? Or like how do we think about it? I know you're not going to give me a number, but just directionally within that 130 above, what are you seeing?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, we won\u2019t give you a number but help you a little bit in trends. Yes, I think we said the combination of the strong sales and the continued uptick from both use of more products on the user side and adoption of products, combined with the compare from the flattening in the second quarter, has resulted in the point in time metrics there increasing in the quarter.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the call back over to Olivier for closing comments.\nOlivier Pomel: All right. Thank you. And just to close this call, I'd just reiterate that we are very, very pleased with our performance this quarter. And I also want to thank again all Datadog worldwide for their very hard work and for a job really, really well done. So thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us for our morning call today. We are very pleased with our performance in Q2, which was stronger than expected on robust growth with existing customers as well as strong new customer sales. We saw real strength both across product lines and across customer segments. For a quick review of the quarter, revenue was $234 million, an increase of 67% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,610 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,015 in the year ago quarter. Those customers generate about 80% of our ARR. We have about 16,400 customers, which is up from about 12,100 last year. We also continued to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $42 million. And our dollar-based net retention rates continued to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. We are pleased that positive business trends from recent quarters continued in Q2. First, usage growth from existing customers remained very robust. Among other factors, we continued to see the impact of our strong new logo growth in the past several quarters as those new customers grow into their commitment. Second, new logo ARR was again strong and we continued to execute against our go-to-market strategy. And third, churn continues to remain low and in line with historical rates. Taking all these factors into account, we had a very strong quarter of ARR added with over $100 million of ARR added for the second consecutive quarter. Next, our platform strategy continued to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 75% of customers are using 2 or more products, up from 68% a year ago.  Additionally, 28% of customers are now using 4 or more products, which is up from 15% last year. And this quarter, approximately 70% of new logos landed with 2 or more products. Our platform saw strong growth in the second quarter, which included another record of ARR added for infrastructure monitoring in a single quarter. This product is still early in its fast cycle. Meanwhile, we continued to see very strong performance with other products in our platform. Our APM suite, including RUM and Synthetics and log management, together, reached over $400 million in ARR. The APM suite and log management also remained in hyper growth mode, but our newer other products are growing even faster. As a result, we are very pleased with the customer uptake of our end-to-end observability platform as well as the beginning of our Cloud Security Platform. Now let's move on to product and R&D. Our teams continued to innovate and solve customer pain points. We announced 73 new features in Q2 and have continued to ship in Q3. To discuss just a few of these, we announced the general availability of 2 new security products, Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud Workload Security, which target security issues around infrastructure. Cloud Security Posture Management runs continuous configuration audit so customers can track environments to industry benchmarks and regulatory standards. And Cloud Workload Security performs real-time threat detection directly within the workloads themselves within hosts and containers. These are our second and third GA products in security, alongside Security Monitoring, which performs a threat detection on events and loading data streams. With these offerings, the first building blocks of our Cloud Security Platform are coming together, and we can start delivering on our vision to break down silos between DevOps and security teams. And with the addition of these 2 products, we now have 11 GA products on the Datadog platform. We are also at the beginning of our opportunity to bring observability to the CI/CD space, and we announced the beta of our CI Visibility product in late July. CI/CD is a combined practice of continuous integration and continuous delivery, allowing software to be consistently written, tested and released to production. The problem is that developers also don't have visibility into their CI/CD pipelines. They have a hard time figuring out if tests are failing and why and where in their CI/CD pipeline they are experiencing bottlenecks and issues. Our CI Visibility product, based on our acquisition of Undefined Labs last August, helps customers gain visibility into their testing pipeline with the goal of lowering costs and increasing efficiency for their developer teams. So we are excited about these announcements, but we're not standing still on our existing products and we'll continue to expand features to make each and every one best-of-breed. In Synthetics, we have enabled cross-product testing and our customers can now test on Microsoft Edge and Firefox in addition to Chrome. Mobile RUM will now support Android, iOS and cross-platform frameworks like React Native. Our RUM product now covers the whole user space, including RUM applications on desktop, mobile and tablets as well as mobile apps. And finally, we continue to improve the AI/ML capabilities of our platform with our most recent addition, including automatic detection of faulty deployments in APM and anomaly detection in Security Monitoring. These are complemented by the continued extension of Watchdog Insights, the recommendation engine we are embedding directly into our users' workflows across our platform. As you can see, our end-to-end observability platform continues to broaden and deepen. Meanwhile, we are beginning to see -- to move forward in our cloud security, and we are in the early days with our CI/CD use cases. As always, I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their creativity, their productivity and their continued ability to deliver the right solutions to our customers' problems. Now moving on to sales and marketing. As hinted by our customer growth this quarter, our go-to-market teams continued to be very productive. So let's discuss some more Q2 wins. First, we had an 8-figure upsell with a next-gen financial services company, which is experiencing a surge of traffic in their core application. They rely on Datadog log management as the platform across the organization to find the root cause of issues. They saw a significant increase in usage of our existing product and recently added our Continuous Profiler to better understand their good performance in production. Next, we had a 7-figure up-sell with a European e-commerce company. They were using multiple commercial observability tools, and one of their 2021 strategic initiatives was to consolidate and reduce costs by standardizing on Datadog to satisfy that goal while improving their team's collaboration and communication. Next, we had a 7-figure upsell with a large global accounting firm. This company is experiencing rapid growth with their online product and its teams were forced to jump from tool to tool to try and mitigate problems. With Datadog as their chosen solution for infrastructure monitoring, APM and Synthetics, they are able to decrease mean time to resolution and free up internal resources. Next, we had a 6-figure upsell with a 30-years-old analytics software company. This company is moving more workload to Azure. With this new upsell, they standardized on Datadog for their log management needs. With our Logging without Limits functionality, this company will lower costs by an order of magnitude for log management without sacrificing any of their log data. And finally, we had a 7-figure land with a large back-office software company. This company is growing rapidly and is planning a move to hybrid cloud. But their previous monitoring adoption rate was very low, which made it difficult for their teams to collaborate. With Datadog, their entire team now has a single platform for all their operability needs, and they recognize Datadog's impact on improving adoption and alignment across teams. So as you can tell, we are incredibly proud of the performance of our go-to-market team this quarter, and I want to thank them for their hard work and for partnering with our customers to deliver another quarter of strong results. Now moving on to our longer-term outlook. We see businesses now moving forward with their longer-term digital strategy. Businesses must increasingly be digital first. Azure platforming remains in its early stages, and we believe we are in a great position to help our customers with our Unified Observability platform. Meanwhile, we are making progress on our long-term vision to break down silos between DevOps and security teams. As a result, we are extremely excited about the opportunities we see to democratize data and help customers increase visibility and manage complexity. And we're confident in our long-term plans and continue to work hard to execute on our strategy. Before turning the call over to David, I want to mention that our teams are busy preparing for Dash 2021, our user conference, which will be held in late October this year. Every year at Dash, we showcase our latest product innovations and we're excited to show everyone what we've been up to this year. We also expect to hold an investor session at Dash. So please look out for that announcement in the fall. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. David? Yes. So we're still seeing some of those. I mean, I think some of those -- what we mentioned in the call in that category where customers were using something else before a collection of different things and they're standardizing on our platform and -- which creates a larger land for us. But that's still not the vast majority of our customer acquisition. By and large, we're still starting with smaller customers and going with them and then they standardize with us later on as they're further down the road in their migration to cloud environment. So we feel -- we see some of that in the proportion that is comparable to what we've seen in different quarters, but we don't see any particular trend there yet. Just to rebound what David just said, we \u2013 unlike many companies that have stops and starts, we kept hiring steadily, which put us in a great position today. Right now, it's an interesting time for hiring because the job market is very hot and there's also many people taking some time off. So it's a lot of effort to grow at the level at which we want, but we're happy with the place we're in and we're very happy we made the choice to keep steadily recruiting throughout the pandemic. Yes. I mean there's 2 aspects to it. One is in terms of penetration, I think the intersection of what we have and what's in the cloud in the next year is still a small fraction of what there is in the market total. So there's a lot more we can get from that. The second aspect is that the world is transforming digitally so the market, like the overall -- the size of the infrastructure that will have to be monitored probably is a lot bigger than what had to be monitored 5 years ago. So when you look at those 2 things, there's a lot more ground to cover in terms of those market penetration and so how much stuff we can cover with infrastructure monitoring. In parallel to that, it's a field that is still evolving, right? There's still -- the name of the game in the cloud is that there are ways of innovation and new ways of running workloads. And we've been through a few of those in Datadog. We started with cloud incentives and then containers and now serverless. We don't expect that to stop there. We think there's going to be new modalities for running infrastructure. And so we're investing heavily in our products to be at the forefront of all that. Well, I love all my children the same. The APM and logs are neck and neck in terms of the adoption across our customer base and I would say the level of maturity. Both products win in situations where we're starting with those products in the back-of-grid kind of setup by customers. And they both can serve as the second leg of the stool in managing to infrastructure to be the basis for standardization for customers. And so what we see today, we've proven at meaningful scale is that customers are standardizing on our offering. They buy into the platform. And the 3 main legs of that stool are going to be APM, logs and infrastructure monitoring. Thank you. So I'll start with the standardization. At this point, it doesn't change our sales cycles too much because the way we do it is it mostly starts small and we grow with customers. And then by the time we standardize, we have a solid foothold at that customer and their engineers are using us all the time and it gets increasingly easier to make the case for standardization. Obviously, there's going to be some changes over time as we cover more and more of the globe with our sales force and that we have customers that have more and more years with us, you know that, right? I do expect to make some changes over the time to the way we operate. But at this point, there's no major tweaks to the sales process or the time it takes. It does -- the standardization does inform a road map from a product perspective because we are investing more and more in technologies that are not necessarily plug-centric. And we're doing that in order to help our customers who standardize bring some of their legacy IT or on-prem IT back into the \u2013 under the same or most of their cloud technology. So this is something really that informs that part of our development. And it will also, in all likelihood, inform some of our efforts around professional services and spending more time bringing those customers across. On the question on the opening of the economy, I mean, look, we \u2013 what's interesting to us is that it looks like the \u2013 we're back to the way the world would move into the cloud more or less before the pandemic. And we don't know if things can go any faster. There seems to be some \u2013 there was a very steady historical trend for us there and we're back to that steady historical trend, so we're happy with that. So the main thing that we're working on right now to maintain long-term growth is make sure that we keep building on the platform so we can add more products, cover the full \u2013 solve the full problem or increasingly large part of the problem for our customers, while at the same time, scaling the go-to-market teams so we can be in all of the conversations everywhere in the world for our customer segments. And we still have quite a bit of work to do in order to achieve that. Yes. So I think there's 3 parts to that answer. The first one is what we saw last year was not price pressure. What we saw last year was customers really seeing their [indiscernible] footprint with Amazon and Azure and the others. And these were the customers with the largest deals because they saw this greatly could still save money when they were facing a lot of uncertainty around cash and that we pulled to us. That's one. Two, when you think long term, the -- it's almost a given that there will need to be a different way of charging for some of the -- for capturing some of the value provided to customers that can't just be attached to the straight volumes of data that are being exchanged because those volume of data are exploding exponentially while our customers' revenues are not going to explode exponentially. So that's one thing that we're working on with all of our products. We have this denomination for all of our products that is without limits, which is basically a way to align the value customers get with the price they pay and give them leverage for that and make sure that we keep unbundling things on our end. So we would give them the power to do that. The third answer to that question is that over time we made the choice to add new functionality largely in the form of new SKUs when they saw new classes of problems for our customers, which is a way basically to maintain price and increase price as we grow and as we see the functionality. We like the fact that it also gives us very good signal in terms of the value these products provide and helps drive the road map of those products. It's similar to what we've seen before. And the motion is really on-prem or legacy that is being consolidated into the cloud. That's what we see. So we see the same trend that we've seen in the past, there's nothing \u2013 there's no other very interesting comment to make about that today. We see what we still see. Yes. So the sales motion there is very much built on -- for now and what we had with observability. And as we're building those products, we're leaning on those customers that are already brought into the Datadog platform and that can self-select to start adopting from our security products. So that's step one. Step two will be as more and more of those products reach GA and reach the financial critical mass to actually start pushing them more directly through the sales force. I think for that, we're actually learning quite a bit from the Sqreen acquisition we've done recently. And we expect that, that will have some interesting things to do in the future. We don't have anything specific to share today, though. Yes. We're investing as aggressively as we can on all fronts. So we -- when we have opportunities to accelerate the investment in R&D, which we've done through a few acquisitions also and these actually largely show up in our R&D expenses on an ongoing basis, so we're doing it. We still think we are very early in what's a very, very, very large opportunity across observability, security and we mentioned today also some of the developer use cases around CI/CD. But also, later on, there's a lot of things we can do in real-time BI, maybe in [indiscernible]. Lots of different things we can touch on. So we're very early. We intend to keep investing heavily in R&D for a very long time. In terms of the impact on the go-to-market, really where we'll see the first need for some changes in the -- on the go-to-market side is as we stop pushing the sell side of the security product more aggressively. It hasn't happened yet. It's not something that we're doing today as those products just barely reached GA for a few of them, but it's something that we'll certainly do in the future. So nothing to share today on that, but it's definitely something that we're working on. So it's very boring. We see the same thing as before. From where we stand, the company's landscape hasn't changed. And our focus is still mostly greenfield, new environments, teams that are going to start small with us and are going to grow with us until they standardize on us for just about everything they do. That's the motion, hasn't changed and/or the landscape around us hasn't changed that much either. So it depends a little bit because we also have some larger commitments on day 1 than we used to. We mentioned that in the previous -- on the first few calls. So overall, the cohorts are longer, they start larger. The ASPs are going up over time generally. And -- but the growth we see is very commensurate with what we've seen in the past in terms of growth in usage on the first month they're with us to the 6 months and 12 months and everything. So it's a 2-part event there. Yes. So it's a great question. There's a lot of commonality in that. A lot of it is about reducing friction and making things that otherwise we go out, look around with a lot of effort and a lot of different people involved and a lot of different departments involved to be very easy and that we can do early on. And so that's -- we know how to do that. That's what we've done throughout the history of the company and so that's the first part. The second part, though, is that the buyer is a little bit different, and in some cases, a buyer might need to be addressed a little bit differently. And that's something a few other of the questions touched upon earlier, so I won't repeat myself too much there, but it's still something that we're working on in terms of how we add that to the motion we have for setting the platform. Yes. So it's a major effort. The \u2013 it's actually one of the areas, Adam, who joined us as the Chief Operating Officer recently. It's going to be his major area of focus today is to make sure that we scale the team that does enablement and that teaches everyone on the sales team and all the go-to-market teams with the product offering, even how it works and who to bring in into every single deals, that we understand exactly how to match the right product to the right customer. So that's one of his major areas of focus. So we're investing in that. Yes. So on the second one, I mean, we don't have anything to share here yet. We're actually \u2013 the only thing I can say is we're very happy with the way it's trending and the way it's growing. And we'll probably share some more at some point, but we don't have anything to say today. On the differentiation, what we'd bring to those categories, we already are instrumenting all those workloads. So we are present on those machines. Our agents are running there. The logs are being collected by us already. We already connect to all those cloud configuration. So there's nothing else to be done really by our customers to turn on security, and that's a major, major differentiator. And we also have all the developers and all the ops people that are watching what we do all day. And they can get \u2013 they can teach the security team as well. They can be part of the solution as opposed to living in a separate silo from the security team. They are tasked with securing those workloads. So when you combine those 2 things, I think we have something that's very powerful, very different and I would say almost impossible for the competition that comes solely from instrumenting the workload from a security perspective to replicate. Well, it's -- we've seen some of that in the market, but it hasn't had any impact on us directly. But I should say that we are investing and we have been investing a lot in new models for charging customers and putting them in control of their spend and making sure that we align with the value adjustments of all data volumes they're producing. And that's a lot of what our without limit offerings are doing. We started with that for logs. We're also doing more and more for APM and infrastructure, and that's something that our customers subscribe to when they standardize on us. And we've mentioned that on the call, some of our customers are able to slash their spending on logs, in particular, because they can spend on what matters to them. They can get over there. They can categorize and retain it. We can only index some of it for some of the very specific purposes they need. They can make direct queryable on demand if they want it, like they can do anything they want. We'll give them all the levers and all the flexibility for that so that their bill doesn't grow linearly with their data volume. So that's something we've already been investing in. So it's not a big change for us, just a continuation of what we've been doing. I mean right now, we're still early in that, too. I mean we're connecting to all sorts of noncloud equipment, so network equipment -- physical network equipment, power distribution units, that sort of stuff. And we'll do more and more of it until we reach a point where a significant part of the market is maturing up in the cloud that it's time for them to standardize. Today, I would say that the customers that standardize and bring their legacy IT into the cloud are still the ones that are at the fore -- or we're are the forefront of their cloud migration to start with their leading edge. So there are signs of things to come, not that we are at that space just yet. There will likely be a few pricing options there. I mean we haven't communicated any of that yet, but we're thinking hard about the various ways these products can be packaged. So we still continued to do with what we've been doing before. So we're getting more and more from those cloud partnerships, and all of these cloud partnerships are developing more and more. We really see on the GCP marketplace recently, where there is \u2013 it makes it easier for customers to deploy or partnership with Azure has taken another step forward recently also as we've been integrated directly to the console. There's still a few parts of that partnership that needs to be implemented. So we're still not completely done yet, but there's still \u2013 we're still making progress on that. And we're also working on deeper partnerships with AWS. So it's happening across the board and the things are trending in the right direction. And at this point, this is not a major part of our success, I would say it's more of a potential upside for the future. Yes. Yes. So it's interesting. It's very early. We know the product space is very big because engineers spend a lot of time wrestling with testing and deploying. And so we know it's spending a lot of time and spending involved there. It's interesting to us because it pushes the boundary of where we operate also and we get closer and more clearly embedded into the developer workflows, what happens on their laptop where they write improvement in the break and test loops on their own environment before they reach even development of steady environment. So it's very interesting to us for that reason. It's more of a massive category in terms of observing and optimizing those environments. So we'll have to see exactly what the market opportunity is there, but we know the problem space is very large. All right. Thank you. And just to close this call, I'd just reiterate that we are very, very pleased with our performance this quarter. And I also want to thank again all Datadog worldwide for their very hard work and for a job really, really well done. So thank you all."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q2. Revenue was $233.5 million, up 67% year-over-year and up 18% quarter-over-quarter. Usage trends were strong and showed broad-based growth. New logo generation was also strong and customers continued to adopt more products across the platform. To provide some more context. First, growth of existing customers was again robust in Q2 and our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 16th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was strong, driven by customers' expanded usage of existing products and the adoption of new products. Our customers are continuing to pursue their cloud migrations. And as we expand with our customers, we see opportunities for them to standardize on us and consolidate their observability tool vendors. Next, we saw a -- we saw for the second consecutive quarter of ARR adds over $100 million with broad strength across product lines, including our newer products, and strength across our regions. New logos were also very strong. We had a record number of both gross and net new logo additions in the quarter. Both our enterprise and commercial sales teams executed strongly in the quarter, and we continued to see broad opportunities across industries and customer size. Remember, that our -- given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue, but do so over time. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. And 70% of our customers are now using 2 or more products and 28% of our customers are now using 4 or more of our products. Lastly, churn remained low, in line with historical levels. Our dollar-based gross retention rates remained unchanged in the mid-90s and they are similar across our customer segments and products. Billings were $270 million, up 69% year-over-year. And there were no pro forma impacts in the quarter. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $583 million, up 103% year-over-year driven by strong sales activity and increased contract duration. The increase in contract duration was driven by a higher mix of annual and multiyear commitments relative to the year ago quarter. As a reminder, multiyear commitments are billed annually and we do not incentivize our sales force towards multiyear deals. Current RPO growth was also strong at over 80% year-over-year. I should note that we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $178 million, representing a gross margin of 76%. This compares to a gross margin of 77% last quarter and 80% in the year ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was due to investments in our product and platform innovation. We expect gross margin in the mid- to long term to be consistent with our historical performance. R&D expense was $71 million or 30% of revenue compared to 27% in the year ago quarter. We continued to invest significantly in R&D, including high growth of our engineering head count. We're pleased that we are successfully executing on our hiring and onboarding plans in R&D. Sales and marketing expense was $61 million or 26% of revenue compared to 33% in the year ago quarter. We continued to make substantial investments in sales and marketing, but revenue growth has outpaced our investment growth. We had only a few in-person events in Q2, but we continue to plan for increased travel and event costs later in this year, of course, depending on local health and travel guidelines. G&A expense was $16 million or 7% of revenue, down from 9% in the year ago quarter. Operating income was $31 million or a 13% operating margin compared to the operating income of $15 million or an 11% operating margin in the year ago quarter. Although strong in the quarter, we are not optimizing for near-term margins as we see a large and dynamic market opportunity in front of us, and we are striving to invest heavily against that opportunity. But Q2, of course, demonstrates the efficiencies of our business model. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $32 million or $0.09 per share on 342 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $52 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $42 million with a free cash flow margin of 18%. Now for our outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2021. We are optimistic about our long-term opportunities and believe we will deliver high growth for the foreseeable future. We are addressing a very large market and are executing well against that opportunity. Taking this into account with the usual conservatism applied, we are updating our guidance as follows: for the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $246 million to $248 million, which represents a 60% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $18 million to $20 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.06 per share based on approximately 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And then for the full year 2021, revenue is expected to be in the range of $938 million to $944 million, which represents a 56% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $87 million to $93 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 per share based on an approximate 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now some notes on our guidance. First, while usage growth was strong in Q2, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions. Second, our strategic focus remains on investing to optimize for long-term growth. We are planning for continued aggressive investments in R&D and go-to-market through the remainder of 2021. And next, our model assumes a return to the office and the resumption of travel and in-person events during Q3. That said, we will remain flexible depending upon local regulations and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees. Regarding items below the operating income line, first, we expect approximately $0.9 million of Q3 non-GAAP net interest and other income, which includes the interest income on our cash and marketable securities and the interest expense on our convertible debt. We do not expect to be a federal taxpayer in Q3, but have a tax provision related to our international entity. And as a result, we expect a tax provision of approximately $600,000 in Q3 and $2 million for the full year. To summarize, we are very pleased with our results this quarter. Customers continue to consume more Datadog, both using more of their existing products and choosing to begin using new products. We added 2 new products this quarter and now have 11 products to offer to our customers. Our execution against our R&D and go-to-market goals remain strong. And our ability to help customers to manage through their cloud migration and digital transformation effects continues to grow. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yes. As we said previously, we're trying to grow our ramp quota approximately in line with revenues. And we had, as we said, throughout COVID last year and this year, we have aggressive hiring plans, which we are executing on. And we haven't changed our sort of goals for hiring and quota expansion throughout the last couple of years. I'll take that. I think what we said was we had a flattening and an optimization in Q2 of last year. And since that time, which is now Q3 of last year through now, we've had a return to more normal or consistent with the long-term trends. And we continue to see that in Q2, a very strong and similar quarter to what we've seen in the last 3, 4 quarters and very consistent with the company's long-term positions in that. And that is reflective, we feel, of a return to normal in the rolling out of cloud migrations and digital projects. And so like we said in previous quarters, the usage growth was very widespread, balanced in products and types of customers, very similar to what we've seen in the history of the company. Yes. Let me start with that. So we said all along that we have 2 drivers. One is in terms of sort of percentage of revenue in the marketing and sort of travel, sort of 3% or so \u2013 3%-plus is sort of a benefit from not having that travel and the event. That does have some volatility depending upon whether you're in a quarter where you have re:Invent and Dash, which is what we're having in Q4. Net, I think we've performed, as you can see on the \u2013 in the revenue line sort of above where we were planning. So essentially, we had a positive surprise in the revenues and that sort of drops down to the bottom line. And secondly \u2013 and lastly, as Oli mentioned, we have very aggressive hiring plans. We are essentially trying to get that done this year. It takes a while to get that done in this market. And so we expect that growth to accelerate, that sort of people side of things, to accelerate in the second half of the year. And we're already seeing that in our hiring numbers. But we have, over the last couple of years, sort of ramped up into our hiring during the course of the year. I think it has a correlation to larger customers who are investing more in Datadog as their standardized observability and want to commit long term. It generally is pulled from the client rather than we go out. Remember, when land and expand, we often see the motion of growing over time and amending contracts with more commitment. So this is really more of a factor of enterprise customers and larger cloud natives committing to Datadog as a core platform and wanting that commitment to be longer term. Broadly speaking, when you look at the consistency of the net retention and the longevity of it, it's still very, very similar in the land and expand with cohorts expanding similar to previous periods, and very importantly, expanding for a long time. So they last \u2013 the cohort expansion continues on for quite a long time, which is very consistent with what we've seen in previous periods. Yes, we won't give you a number but help you a little bit in trends. Yes, I think we said the combination of the strong sales and the continued uptick from both use of more products on the user side and adoption of products, combined with the compare from the flattening in the second quarter, has resulted in the point in time metrics there increasing in the quarter."

We had a strong start to the year and are very pleased with our performance in Q1, which was strong across all parts of the business and again showed high growth at scale and demonstrated efficiencies. It has been a busy start of the year, we had two products become generally available, Continuous Profiler, and Incident Management. We closed the acquisition of Sqreen and Timber. And we continued to release new features and innovations across our platform. In addition, we continue to hire and build our team at a very rapid pace. Now to review the quarter. To summarize Q1 at a high level, revenue was $199 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,437 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 960 last year. These customers generate over 75% of our ARR. We have about 15,200 customers, up from about 11,500 in the year ago quarter. This means we added about 1,000 customers in the quarter, making it another strong quarter of adds and consistent for the last few quarters. We also continue to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $44 million. And finally, our dollar-based net retention rate continues to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and added to our newer products. In addition to that, the positive business trends from recent quarters have continued in Q1. First, usage growth from existing customers was stronger than expected and above historical levels. Among other factors, we are seeing the benefit of new logos signed in the back half of last year as they grow into their commitment. Second, new logo ARR was strong in what is normally a seasonally slower quarter. Showing our go-to-market investments are paying off. And third, churn continues to remain very low and in line with historical rates. Taking all these factors into account, we had a very strong quarter of ARR added. In fact, we hit an important milestone, as we added over $100 million of ARR in a single quarter for the first time. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q1, 75% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 63% last year. Additionally, 25% of customers are using four or more products, which is up from only 12% a year ago. And we also have hundreds of customers using six or more of our nine generally available products. But it's still early. We think this is an interesting proof point that shows the continued sell opportunity in our customer base. And we had another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products. I\u2019d like to provide an update on some of our more recent products, Network Performance Monitoring, Real User Monitoring and Synthetics. Both Network Performance Monitoring and Real User Monitoring became generally available a bit more than a year ago and we are excited to share that both are at approximately eight figures of ARR, and are showing high growth. And Synthetics also continues to grow rapidly, and it\u2019s an increasingly important contributor to revenue. As a reminder, our newer products are often adopted first by just selecting customers at small scale before our land-and-expand model enables greater adoption over time. And frictionless adoption from our single integrated platform is a key value proposition for our customers. Well, we are very pleased with the performance of our newer products, I also want to spend some time on the core of our observability platform. Infrastructure, APM and logs, all three added record amounts of ARR in the quarter, showing the strength of our platform. APM and logs have both reached last scale, and remaining hypergrowth while infrastructure continues to grow at a healthy base. To give you a sense of scale, APM and logs together added more ARR this quarter that the business as a whole did one year ago. So it is clear to us that these products are each strong enough to the best of breed solutions on their own. And to that point Datadog was recognized as a leader in Gartner\u2019s 2021 Magic Quadrant for APM for the first time. And in fact, we were the only vendor in the leader quadrant that improved its position to the last report. Gartner have specifically highlighted or strong history of product development, and our ability to bring products to market rapidly. As a reminder, we entered the APM market just four years ago. And our APM product has a robust feature set, including end-to-end distributed tracing with no sampling and seamless correlation of traces with end-to-end observability. The ability to triage problem was also highlighted as strength with a unified platform assisting in root cause analysis and reducing resolution time. And lastly, our transparent pricing, which is available on our website, was also recognized as helping to build customer trust. We also continue to make investments in the Watchdog, which is the brain behind AI-based features across the Datadog platform. In Q1, we announced a few enhancements, including Watchdog Insights, which is a recommendation engine that is always on and automates manual investigations by automatically detecting anomalies and outliers and allowing for faster times resolution. We also announced the beta of Watchdog root cause analysis, which automatically identifies closer relationships between different issues across applications infrastructure, and pinpoints the root cause. In addition, we continued innovating across our platform, releasing 38 features in Q1 and crossing 450 out of the box integrations. A few features to highlight include Network Performance Monitoring for Microsoft Windows, which is a very differentiated feature for Datadog NPM. New marketplace integration, including Oracle Cloud, as well as the official launch of our GovCloud instance allowing us to onboard early customers in the government space. Lastly, on the product side, I want to briefly discuss our acquisition of Sqreen, which closed in early April. We find it Datadog to breakdown silos between Dev and Ops teams and as we\u2019ve discussed previously, we are working to extend that to security teams as well. Stream is an application security solution that actively detects attacks and can track trace them down to the impacted function call. It prevents application security exploits and enables response across development, security and upstream. We are very excited at the combination of Sqreen with our APM and security offerings, as we expect it to allow our customers to protect APM submitted applications with very little additional friction. And we will share updates as we progress with integrating external platform. Now, let\u2019s switch gears and move on to sales and marketing. I am very proud of the continued productivity from our go-to-market team. As we mentioned last quarter, we have been hiring at a rapid pace across our sales order, and are seeing more teams and reps becoming productive. Now, let\u2019s discuss of our wins this quarter. First, we had a seven-figure land was one of the world\u2019s largest consulting firms undergoing a multi-billion dollar cloud migration. With Datadog they have reduced their monitoring costs by more than 35% with greater visibility into every layer of their stack, including several functions. Next, we had a six-figure or high tech figure, I should say, land deal was a major transportation company. The company is moving towards a DevOps culture, but was hindered by a proliferation of siloed and underutilized monitoring tools. After implementing Datadog engineers now have a single easy to use platform that facilitates mass adoption. Next, we had a six-figure land from the largest supermarket chain. The company has 1000s of stores and is in the process of migrating from legacy IT to an Azure based cloud. Datadog unified platform help enable this migration and reduce mean time to resolution by up to 50%. Next, I want to discuss a seven-figure up sales EVA online gaming company. Prior to Datadog business units were spending too much time responding to incident and look for a single source of truth visibility across all teams and systems. This company reduce its usage from eight observability tools to one and Datadog is also used by executives all the way up to the CEO. Last, we had a seven-figure up sale to an existing million dollar plus customer in the financial services. During COVID this large enterprise accelerated its digital transformation journey as they enhanced their digital tools and money presence. And it continues to grow with Datadog as they migrate more workloads to the cloud and have adopted newer products like NPM and Synthetics. Moving on now to a longer term outlook. While the pandemic continues to impact the macro environment, businesses are starting to turn to priorities in the post-COVID world. Business is must be digital first, which we expect will move forward digital transformation projects, massive IT platforming is still in its early stages. We believe we are in a great position with a unified observability platform. While there is the possibility for more near term volatility caused by the macro environment, we are increasingly confident in our ability to execute and in our long-term opportunity. Before handling the call to David, there are two changes to the management team I would like to bring to your attention. First, our Chief Revenue Officer, Dan Fougere will transition out of the company this quarter to take some well deserved time off after a few decades of hard work. We are very grateful to Dan for many quarters of growth and for developing a world class organization. We are confident that the team is built will continue carrying the torch and will exceed expectations, the data the way. We also running a search for new CRO, now evaluating both internal and external candidates. Second, I'm pleased to announce that we will soon be joined by our first ever Chief Operating Officer, Adam Blitzer, who joins us after a successful tenure as an EVP and GM at Salesforce. Adam will help us scale as a SaaS platform company and will oversee a number of our front office functions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. We had a very strong start to the year revenues was $198.5 million, up 51% year-over-year against the challenging year ago comp. Usage trends were strong and show broad-based growth. New logo generation continues to be strong and customers continue to adopt more products across the platform. To provide some more context first, growth of existing customers was robust again, and our dollar base net retention rate remained above 130% for the 15 consecutive quarter. We are pleased with the usage growth of existing customers, which indicates continued adoption of our platform and continued migration to the cloud even in the face of macro pressures. As Oliv mentioned, usage growth was stronger than expected and above historical levels and usage growth was broad base across our customer base. Also, we added a record number of 100,000 plus customers in the quarter given our land and expand model, a majority of these ads were existing customers. In addition, we had a strong uptick in the quarter in million dollar customers. Next, our new logo results were strong. In fact, it was our second best new logo, ARR quarter ever, and a record for Q1. Contributions were strong across our enterprise and commercial sales channels. Earlier Olivier shared several large new logo wins across more traditional industries and encouraging sign as companies across a wide spectrum, start embracing digital transformation projects. Remember that given our uses based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue. Next in the first quarter we saw continued strength, as Olivier discussed in our platform strategy, with 75% of our customers using two or more products, and 25% of our customers now using for more products, up from only 12% a year ago. Next churn was consistent with historical levels. This demonstrates the importance of our solution to our customers. Our dollar base gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the mid-90s. And this was true across customer segments, and in each of our infrastructure, APM and log products. Taken together, this resulted in a record quarter of ARR at over $100 million and up significantly versus Q1 last year. Now turning to billing. Billings worth $220 million, up 59% year-over-year, there were no major proforma impacts to call out in the quarter. Remaining performance obligations are RPOs was $464 million, up 81% year-over-year. Contract duration continued to be at an increased level from the year-ago period. RPO strength is driven by strong annual billings and commitments, as well as a few large multi year commits. It is important to know that those multiyear commits are billed annually. And we do not incentivize our sales force for multiyear deals given our high net retention. Current RPO growth was also strong in the high 60%. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate versus revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the signing of customer contracts, while revenue incorporates customer usage. Now, let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $153 million, representing a gross margin of 77%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and 80% in the year ago period. The slight decrease in gross margin as we've discussed before is due to our investments in product and platform innovation. We expect gross margin to continue to be slightly down from last year in the remainder of the year, as we build out new cloud data centers and prioritize product development. R&D expense was $61 million, or 31% of revenue, compared to 27% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest significantly in R&D, including a high growth in our engineering head count. Engineering head count continues to grow slightly ahead of the pace of revenue growth and we have been able to attract talent and are successfully executing on our hiring and onboarding plans, despite COVID. Sales and marketing expense was $53 million, or 28% of revenues, compared to 32% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing. But the pace of the revenue growth has outpaced pace investment growth. This was another quarter of no in-person trade shows and marketing events. And while we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead generating activities, it is not on a one-for-one ratio. G&A expense was $16 million or 8% of revenue, slightly lower than the 9% in the year ago quarter and operating income was $20 million or a 10% operating margin compared to an operating income of $16 million or 12% in the year ago period. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $20 million or $0.06 a share, based on $344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash from operation was a strong $52 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $44 million for margin of 22%. Free cash flow was driven by strong collections stemming from our strong billings in Q4 and Q1. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2021. We believe we can deliver high growth for the foreseeable future, as we are addressing a very large greenfield market and are executing well against that opportunity. We are optimistic about the long-term opportunity and have seen an uptick in metrics driving our business growth. Taking this into account with our usual conservativism implies, we're updating our guidance as follows. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $211 million to $213 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 51% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.03 to $0.04 per range, based on an approximate 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year 2021, revenues are expected to be in the range of $880 million to $890 million, which represents a 47% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.16 per share based on $345 million weighted average diluted shares. Now, some notes on our guidance, while usage growth was strong in Q1, when providing guidance as usual, we use more conservative assumptions. Next, our strategic focus remains investing to optimize for the long-term. Therefore, we are planning to continue aggressive investments in R&D and go-to-markets throughout 2021. We believe the efficiencies of our business are evident, and we are confident in our ability to be a sizeable and materially profitable company over the long-term. Additionally, our model assumes the return to the office and a resumption of travel and in-person events in the second half of the year. We have limited visibility on these topics, but believe it's prudent to incorporate this in our outlook. Finally, in early April, we closed our acquisition of screen. We are pleased to welcome more than 50 members of the screen team today to dock. The acquisition has an immaterial impact on our income statement. And our cash flow statement in Q2 will reflect the $190 million of cash that we paid for the acquisition. Now below the operating income line. We expect approximately $1 million of Q2 non-GAAP other income, which is net including the interest income on our cash and marketable securities, less the interest expense on our convertible debt. We do not expect to be a federal taxpayer in 2021, but have a tax provision related to our international entity. We expect the tax provision to be approximately $700,000 in Q2 and $3 million for the full year. Now to summarize, we are very pleased with the results of the quarter. Customers continue to consume more Datadog, both in terms of usage and cross selling to newer products, and the execution remained strong. We believe the importance of our solutions will only be strengthened long-term by the continued trends of cloud migration and digital transformation. And now, with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thanks and congrats on an amazing quarter. Olivier, can you \u2013 you talked about the growing momentum you have around APM and the recognition you get from the industry experts? Can you talk a little bit about where we are in terms of APM adoption in your client base in terms of number of applications that are getting properly monitored? And what are you seeing in terms of where you are getting used where maybe some of the traditional legacy guys are getting used for APM? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so great question. I think we are seeing a lot of adoption from APM, I think anyway, we back an eternity ago, when we took the company public, we were saying that APM probably had a bit of a longer fuse to it, but had a very long runway as more and more applications move to the cloud and more than become critical, and that's what we see happen today. In terms of our penetration among customer application, that keeps up with the ratio of the \u2013 let's call it the instances or containers that are covered with APM from the total recycling containers that we see for infrastructure monitoring. There is quite a bit of runway in there, but that ratio is already higher than the famous Gartner Quadrant of 5% applications being monitored. So we think we're clearly targeting to build applications in major cloud environments. We are starting to see from some of our larger enterprise customers, some of their on-prem applications that are being instrumented with our APM as well, but I would say that\u2019s more of a Phase 2 of adoption as opposed to what we have and how we start with customers.\nOperator: Thank you. And we do have our next question from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions, and congrats to the team on a really exceptional quarter, really good start to the year. To follow on Raimo\u2019s question, I think what sort of impressing me is the multi product adoption, and frankly, in some of the newer category, so you mentioned APM logs, but you also called out networking as well, and some of the other new products. When you think about the networking opportunity, what's driving that strong growth? Is it just maturity of the product sort of being a year two product? Or did you see some benefits from some of the competitors like SolarWinds, of course the SUNBURST attack? How do you see that networking opportunity for Datadog relative to APM and some of the other products?\nOlivier Pomel: I think it's a combination of \u2013 there is a lot of market need, because networking, especially in next-generation cloud environment, and especially for companies that have one foot in the cloud and one foot in prem, is not something that is well covered in terms of monitoring and understanding, so there is a big need there. And the second part of that is, as you mentioned, the product maturity, I mean, that product is getting better and better, it covers more and more of the use cases, which means it goes from being great for a small number of customers to be in great form larger and larger fraction of our market and customer data. When do we switching off that is what we announced \u2013 mentioned in the call today, which is the our performance monitoring today also works for Microsoft, Windows. And as it turns out, it's very differentiated to have a cloud-based network performance monitoring product that also works on Microsoft, Windows, and it helps a lot of those customers with very hybrid deployment.\nSanjit Singh: Makes a ton of sense, Olivier. And then as a follow-up question, as we think about the new announcement with a great hire for the CEO position. Can you sort of walk us through the thinking around why now is the right time to bring the CEO on board, is it about where the businesses in terms of scale, was there a certain new market segments that you want to target? What\u2019s sort of the thinking behind bringing on a Chief Operating Officer in today\u2019s doc?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, the thinking is we need to scale the team. We \u2013 fast forward a few years will be a lot bigger, and we're building a platform, there is a number of things that we'll need to do, right and there is a number of \u2013 there is going to be a number of times to solve along the way. And it was always given that we need to grow the bandwidth of the senior management team. And as we embarked on that, we also thought to bring into the company some experience with later stages of scale and growth look like for SaaS companies, and especially SaaS platform companies, which explains to you the hire we're making here.\nSanjit Singh: Makes a lot of sense. Congrats again. Thank you.\nOperator: And we do have our next question from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, I just wanted to follow-up on the question around Adam, obviously a huge endorsement for you guys. But Adam was the founder of a company and effectively was running a lot of the outbound activity. And I'm curious, most COOs, at least the definition of taking care of the inside of the company versus the outside. Can you just talk to his role on the outside and with customers in the interaction versus the folks on the inside, I think there is just some \u2013 trying to understand, where he is going to be spending most of his time?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, it's a great question. And the focus is actually on a lot of the [indiscernible] function. And these are going to have to do with servicing our customers and growing our customers. I won't go into too much details \u2013 our teams are \u2013 like, we have a fairly idiosyncratic setup for how we go-to-market and how we serve customers. That is aligned with our learn and expand low friction model. But, Adam is going to lead a number of those teams.\nBrent Thill: Okay, great.\nOlivier Pomel: And focus is outwards instead inwards.\nBrent Thill: Okay, that's great. A quick one for David, just you mentioned duration is up. Can you remind us what the duration is now versus what you saw a year ago?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, the billings duration we said, it's in the seven \u2013 around seven months and the contract duration spread out towards \u2013 more towards a year and then nine plus months. And it's maintain that so what we saw was over the last couple quarters, given the multi-year contracts and the increase of annual billing, the contract duration increased.\nBrent Thill: Okay, thanks for the color.\nDavid Obstler: Yes.\nOperator: And we do have our next question from Matt Hedberg from RBC.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thank you. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. So thinking about the capabilities of screen and the potential cross-sell opportunities, could you give us a little color on what type of solutions your customers currently have to address these needs? And if you think of this as a competitive environment within your customer, it's more of another greenfield opportunity.\nOlivier Pomel: So it's really more of a greenfield opportunity. Today, customers typically don't have anything or they have something it's not really deployed. And the reason for that is that to inject application security inside the application, there's actually quite a bit of friction. Where the combination with Datadog and with our APM makes sense is that we've already incurred that friction to instrument the application with APM and the point of infection is the same. And that's where we think the proverbial one plus one equals three happens by adding Sqreen to Datadog. And I should say, it's only going to be the start, right. I mean, we \u2013 there's a lot more we want to do in application security. In the rest of security, the first step is we need to plug the detection protection directly at the APM level with Sqreen.\nMatt Swanson: And that kind of leads directly into what I wanted to go to for my second question, which is, Olivier, you guys are really have a front row seat to digital transformation. And you obviously then get to also see some of the security challenges that arise from that so what are some of those other areas of security that maybe you're seeing as pain points for your customers?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, there's many. Look to the \u2013 it seems like every other month, there's a large scale attack that brings a new array of security into focus. But the way we see the world and the way it leads to us, we're focusing on applications in the cloud. And for that, we think there are important aspects of it that happen at the application level, which is what we're addressing with Sqreen. There are important aspects of it, that are happening at the infrastructure level. And we have a few different products that we started last year. And that we're still developing and shipping around that, then there's one big part of it that has to do with putting all this information together into an actionable system of record. In the on-prem world would be a team. We also have a product, a security monitoring product that is a precursor to a team that we're building into a team that's not there yet. So we really intend to cover that whole spectrum specifically for applications to the cloud, and specifically for use cases that are going to bring together DevOps and security. In general, when you think of the problems companies have in this current environment. The first one is that the tooling is very bare bones, most of it doesn't exist or is too high friction, it doesn\u2019t get developed, it doesn't get deployed. But the other thing that happens in most of the companies that is really, really hard to operationalize security because it's hard to get that in ops and security to be on the same page and work together. And that's where I think we can make a big difference if we use our platform the right way and if we build those products right.\nMatt Swanson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we do have our next question from Bhavan Suri from William Blair.\nBhavan Suri: Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on another well executed quarter. I want to touch on the partner network. You announced kind of the launch of the former partner network in January kind of expands go-to-market, sell service for implementation and things like that. Can you just talk about the early interest you're seeing there, the traction because you're not a heavy services companies. There's not a lot of implementation or lift here. So how is that playing out? And kind of how does that play into sort of more of a medium term, long-term channel strategy. Is this really a growth driver? Is this sort of efficiency driver? How should we think about that?\nOlivier Pomel: So for us, it's really a growth driver, right. I think when you look at Datadog, we have plenty of efficiency. And the way we think about everything is how do we get the biggest part of that market, which we think is going to be gigantic? How do we build the products we need to get to all that? How do we reach all the customers across all regions in all segments to get there so that's how we think about it. So when we look at our partner program, we see it to that lens, and we are very happy with the adoptions we've had there. There's a number of things we need to do still, I mean, it's still I would say very early, we have validating wins, like we've talked about some of those in previous calls. But there's a lot more we want to build over the next year. I would say so, more specific update in this quarter. But I do expect that we'll talk about it again.\nBhavan Suri: Got you, got you, got you. And then I want to touch a little bit on sort of pricing and competition kind of combined. If I were to look at pricing in general, you're viewed as kind of having a really attractive price point in terms of modern vendors. But then, as you get into enterprises, given the scale, you're being deployed at, whether pricing is cheap or expensive is different, but it becomes a big number. And guys, like New Relic, Sumo, Splunk, have all made adjustments to pricing models in the last 12 months. In your last quarter, you said you're having a pricing model. I'm just wondering, are you seeing any pushback at the enterprise level? Are you seeing customers after price concessions? Anecdotally, just some sense of the confidence you have that there is sort of a non-issue around pricing at the enterprise level, given the scale again, I'd love to understand how you think about that, and what you're seeing competitively those guys sort of use pricing as a FUD or maybe even as a way to get into some accounts.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so first of all, on pricing and price push back. Look, we have customers that pay us more than $10 million a year. I knew that somebody\u2019s paying them $10 million a year and is not asking for a lower price. But look, at the end of the day, the way we think about it is this is very high leverage thing for our customers. And this is a tiny compared to what they spend on their infrastructure and on their engineering teams. And the way we think about pricing for all the data and everything they send us is that these models are going to grow exponentially over time. They're going to grow faster than these customers top line for all practical purposes. And so pricing will have to adapt, how smart we are about getting, interpreting that data, or how we price and how we structure the model that is customers care more and more with us. I will say that while we do have pricing conversation with customers, especially large ones, we don't see the kind of competitive pressure, you might imagine if you read the competition in the marketing website. The best illustration of that would be, David mentioned in the call that we had gross retention in the mid-90s. And this is stable across various segments of our customers. Also stable across products if you take each of our infrastructure APM and logs products individually, you see the same numbers. What this tells you is that there's very little that goes away. There's not a lot of room there for control price-driven competition.\nBhavan Suri: Got you. Super helpful. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions and great job again.\nOperator: And we do have our next question from Michael Turits from KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: Hey, guys, first of all quick regulations. I\u2019d like to continue on the competitive front relative to a couple of directions. One, obviously, announcement from Splunk recently; secondly, the impact of Open-source OpenTelemetry; and third, whether or not there\u2019s any change from the cloud vendors recent announcement AWS.\nOlivier Pomel: So, I have the usual boring answer, which is that we don\u2019t really see any change to the competitive landscape. It\u2019s a bit early for me to comment on the Splunk announcements, because if they just did that yesterday, but from what we could see, it seems to be somewhat announcement from the repackaging of the product they had been doing for the past few quarters, and that we had seen in the market. So there\u2019s no big change of surprise. And on the other side, that we don\u2019t see from anybody else, we don\u2019t see any big change that is impacting us much. The biggest impact of competitive announcements I see is, is typically the day of the announcement where somebody has to figure out what\u2019s going on and explain it. And that\u2019s about it. We don\u2019t \u2013 we are not condition given a productive document, and we also know condition given in our go to market.\nMichael Turits: So let me follow up on that maybe just drill down further, I brought up OpenTelemetry, is there any sense that with those open to energy that the agent is essentially commoditize is that. So is that forcing you in any way to focus even more, so let\u2019s call up the stack in terms of analytics or other value at.\nOlivier Pomel: Also we were so first of all, we fully \u2013 we all only know OpenTelemetry as well. And to us, it\u2019s not a change, right, our agent was Open-source already. It\u2019s \u2013 it was free for everybody, including our competition to reduce. We lean into open source format and libraries to instrument obligations for a very long time. And we support a large number of them. The way we see the problem is not like what matters is not with technology we use to get from here to there. What matters is to solve the end to end problem for our customers. And to make it as easy as possible for them to just plug us in and everything just work everything to show that we don\u2019t get our mess, a gigantic mess with all these different technologies and applications and clouds, everything else. We turn that into something that the understanding is well ordered, without any effort. That\u2019s what we hit the market in the end. And that\u2019s what we see all of this and device bits and pieces that appear in the middle like the format\u2019s and the libraries and everything else is will change and it has changed, will change its doesn\u2019t matter.\nMichael Turits: Okay, thanks very much. Nice quarter.\nOperator: Next question from Jack Andrews from Needham.\nJack Andrews: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize, I\u2019ve been jumping around calls. But I just had a broader question. Just \u2013 when we think about just the proliferation of new products that you can continue to introduce, how would you characterize where your Salesforce is in terms of just their knowledge and ability to really understand and appropriately sell all this functionality that you have to offer?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, so far it\u2019s working. I think, look, we do have a fairly differentiated go to market and the way we organize internally, which to know where we land. We\u2019ll end with and hope customers adopt your product, and how they learn about those products. So, it doesn\u2019t rely on having every single sales rep, understanding every single little feature we have in every product to product, that wouldn\u2019t be practical. So it is working, we\u2019re very confident in that. I would say, there\u2019s a point at which we might have to consider tweaking the way we go to market. And I think that we\u2019ll have to do more with when we start actively selling to what might be different buyers. And I think we\u2019ve discussed this before. But as I\u2019m thinking more specifically of the security market, we\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019re not actively pushing to the security buyers today with our product. But when that happens, we might have to make some tweaks, win a day.\nJack Andrews: Okay, thanks. So just as a quick follow up, can you maybe just talk about how much of your new business today is perhaps generated from partnerships with the public cloud vendors, I believe, have strategic relationships with all three of the big clouds entering the year here. So, how should we be thinking about their relative contributions moving forward?\nOlivier Pomel: So, we don\u2019t have any, any numbers to share on that. I will say that, a lot of the historically a lot of that has been informal in that we work alongside the provider, but there\u2019s no formal agreement or RevShare and everything else. We started to put some of those in place more recently, around the committed resources for going to market jointly, things like that. But we didn\u2019t have anything to share on that.\nJack Andrews: Okay, thanks. Congratulations on the result.\nOperator: And we do have our next question from Andrew Nowinski from Davidson.\nAndrew Nowinski: Customers, I think he had 97 in Q4 that spent over a million in ARR. Can you just give us any more color around what do you call the strong uptick in those customers this quarter? And then did you have any outsize deals in the quarter?\nDavid Obstler: Let me just take that as a metric. We said we were going to announce that once a year and give some comment on flavors. So, we\u2019re not going to give the number but, it was a \u2013 it\u2019s a strong uptick. And as we talked about, it has a lot to do with the expansion of customers into that $1 million range. As far as a concentration in the quarter, nothing out of the ordinary, we continue to have some very needy labs, but given the land and expand model and the number of customers bring on we don\u2019t have a concentration that produces a quarter.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay, great. And then maybe just a follow up question on the gross margin side, you ticked down a little bit lower than expected. Was there anything abnormal on the gross margin side? Did you expect that to come back up going forward?\nDavid Obstler: It\u2019s the way we see.\nOlivier Pomel: Go ahead David.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, sorry\u2026\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so on a gross margin, so the way we think about this is due to us having the product teams work on product development, instead of working on optimizing, and we\u2019re still happy with gross margins where they are, they might still fluctuate, they probably would fluctuate a bit lower than they were last year because we\u2019re very busy building product. But there\u2019s nothing fundamentally changed around our margin. And there\u2019s many other things we can do in the future to optimize if we so wish. So right now the call we\u2019re making is we focus on product development, we focus on making sure that we grow the top-line in the short and mid-term and then we \u2013 if things get out of hand on the gross margin side, we\u2019ll spend some more time on optimization.\nAndrew Nowinski: Got it? Thank you.\nOperator: And we do have our next question from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Merwin: All right, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the CRO position, I think you mentioned that in prepared remarks looking for a new one. I mean, should we take that to mean that perhaps is more even more of an enterprise focus as it relates to your go to market organization? Just curious, what type of person you\u2019re looking for? And what if anything we should read in queue as we think about any sort of evolution with the go to market motion of the of the company. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, there\u2019s really nothing to read to it. I think it\u2019s a continuation of what we have. Right now where we have a deep bench on the leadership side, we\u2019re very happy with the leadership we have in place. And we\u2019ll still be looking at going to be looking for a new CRO, and we\u2019re going to be looking at candidates both internally and externally for that, but there\u2019s no willing desire to change course or anything fundamentally different from where we were.\nChris Merwin: Got it, thank you. And apologies if this has been asked, but in terms of duration, I know that, in prior quarters, it seems like that was coming in customers were looking to do shorter deals, anything changing on that front? I mean, it seems like all the work has been in the business, certainly, as we get into recovery here used to just going higher. Just curious, if you could comment on duration?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, it pulled in, and we talked about in Q3 as risk management happened. And then we said in Q4, both billings and contract duration pulled back out basically, in billings, in the seven to eight and contract duration nine, 10s around that. And it has to do with, client preferences. And we continued to have that same sort of duration in Q1 that we had in Q4. So it's very similar to the trend we talked about last time, which is more duration on contracts year-over-year but between Q4 and Q1, there really wasn't much change in the way clients approached the contracting.\nChris Merwin: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we do have our next question from a Yun Kim from Loop Capital.\nYun Kim: Great. First, congrats on a strong quarter Oli and David, you mentioned that a strong usage trend, driving strong results in the quarter, is there any way to qualify whether that joins in usage came from, existing deployments, or relatively new deployments that just happened to ramp in the quarter and then also, on usage, I know it's only Q1. But how much of that strings in usage was already captured in the contract versus, the usage that came in well above contract provision, so that cause customers to kind of renew at a higher contract volume. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Do you want to take? I'll start with that. So we had, it was very broad based across industries, we had a combination of customers that we brought on with the strong new logos in the second half of the year, and in Q1 begin to ramp because we are land and expand. And customers that were already using us and have been using us for a year or more increase their activities. We think it has a lot to do with the increase of activity on digital transformation and workloads. As in previous quarters, about two thirds of the increase of usage was from customers using more of the products they had purchased in the previous period and about one third was a cross sell or new and that continued in the quarter. So it was a combination of new logos, increased usage of existing products, and very robust cross selling and adoption of the bought one.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. So there wasn't any necessarily different trends that kind of draw the outside in the usage trend in the quarter, per se from previous quarters.\nOlivier Pomel: It was very, it was brought all that, all three of those were positive in terms of both the scaling of new customers, the cross-sell and the increased usage of existing products.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. And then just last question for me, can you just talk about any geographical trend that you're seeing out there that you expect to see for this year, especially in Europe. Thanks.\nDavid Obstler: Europe, let me take that. Europe has been strong for us. We have not seen the slower vaccination attract and we have seen, pretty good resumption of growth across all the geographies. We'll have to continue to watch it because there's variation in back to work and back to office but as it relates to Q1 and Q4 we saw fairly uniform strength across the regions.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we do have our next question from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you very much and really nice quarter guys. First question is on Datadog continuous profiler and now that it's GA, what sort of trial and paid activity? Have you seen so far? It would seem like there would be a lot of interest in getting ongoing visibility into COVID performance. But any early anecdotes would be helpful there?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, so very happy with the product being very strong out of the gate. We don't have any numbers to share. And just to explore early in its cycle that is still number of things that we need to do to the product so that, it works well for everyone who wants to use it. But it's a product that is very beloved by its users put it this way. So it's got a very strong fan, a feeling that they can give you.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, that's great. And then, you mentioned earlier that you saw an uptick in metrics, would you say that your internal metrics are back to pre pandemic levels or not quite yet?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, I think it's at this point, I'm losing track of what we're comparing to that pre pandemic level. So far back, but we love we're very happy with what happened over the Q3, Q4 and Q1. We had a very, very strong Q1. We still think, we don't know what the macro is going to who is going to impact us we still think the, because all customers are having an affected the same way, the same time. We just feel a bit more uncertain. There used to be, but look, we feel good about the business, right. I think we just increase the guidance for the full year. I think it went from 38% so close to 47%. That should tell you that we forget about where we are in about the business.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Olivier.\nOperator: This concludes the question and answer portion. I will now turn the call over to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. And in closing, I would just want to reiterate that we're very, very pleased with our performance to start the year. That I am personally very proud of our execution that I want to thank all of our employees or Datadog\u2019s for the continued hard work. Thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks Yuka. Welcome to the team at Datadog. And thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong start to the year and are very pleased with our performance in Q1, which was strong across all parts of the business and again showed high growth at scale and demonstrated efficiencies. It has been a busy start of the year, we had two products become generally available, Continuous Profiler, and Incident Management. We closed the acquisition of Sqreen and Timber. And we continued to release new features and innovations across our platform. In addition, we continue to hire and build our team at a very rapid pace. Now to review the quarter. To summarize Q1 at a high level, revenue was $199 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with 1,437 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 960 last year. These customers generate over 75% of our ARR. We have about 15,200 customers, up from about 11,500 in the year ago quarter. This means we added about 1,000 customers in the quarter, making it another strong quarter of adds and consistent for the last few quarters. We also continue to be capital efficient with free cash flow of $44 million. And finally, our dollar-based net retention rate continues to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and added to our newer products. In addition to that, the positive business trends from recent quarters have continued in Q1. First, usage growth from existing customers was stronger than expected and above historical levels. Among other factors, we are seeing the benefit of new logos signed in the back half of last year as they grow into their commitment. Second, new logo ARR was strong in what is normally a seasonally slower quarter. Showing our go-to-market investments are paying off. And third, churn continues to remain very low and in line with historical rates. Taking all these factors into account, we had a very strong quarter of ARR added. In fact, we hit an important milestone, as we added over $100 million of ARR in a single quarter for the first time. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate and win in the market. As of the end of Q1, 75% of customers are using two or more products, which is up from 63% last year. Additionally, 25% of customers are using four or more products, which is up from only 12% a year ago. And we also have hundreds of customers using six or more of our nine generally available products. But it's still early. We think this is an interesting proof point that shows the continued sell opportunity in our customer base. And we had another quarter in which approximately 75% of new logos landed with two or more products. I'd like to provide an update on some of our more recent products, Network Performance Monitoring, Real User Monitoring and Synthetics. Both Network Performance Monitoring and Real User Monitoring became generally available a bit more than a year ago and we are excited to share that both are at approximately eight figures of ARR, and are showing high growth. And Synthetics also continues to grow rapidly, and it's an increasingly important contributor to revenue. As a reminder, our newer products are often adopted first by just selecting customers at small scale before our land-and-expand model enables greater adoption over time. And frictionless adoption from our single integrated platform is a key value proposition for our customers. Well, we are very pleased with the performance of our newer products, I also want to spend some time on the core of our observability platform. Infrastructure, APM and logs, all three added record amounts of ARR in the quarter, showing the strength of our platform. APM and logs have both reached last scale, and remaining hypergrowth while infrastructure continues to grow at a healthy base. To give you a sense of scale, APM and logs together added more ARR this quarter that the business as a whole did one year ago. So it is clear to us that these products are each strong enough to the best of breed solutions on their own. And to that point Datadog was recognized as a leader in Gartner's 2021 Magic Quadrant for APM for the first time. And in fact, we were the only vendor in the leader quadrant that improved its position to the last report. Gartner have specifically highlighted or strong history of product development, and our ability to bring products to market rapidly. As a reminder, we entered the APM market just four years ago. And our APM product has a robust feature set, including end-to-end distributed tracing with no sampling and seamless correlation of traces with end-to-end observability. The ability to triage problem was also highlighted as strength with a unified platform assisting in root cause analysis and reducing resolution time. And lastly, our transparent pricing, which is available on our website, was also recognized as helping to build customer trust. We also continue to make investments in the Watchdog, which is the brain behind AI-based features across the Datadog platform. In Q1, we announced a few enhancements, including Watchdog Insights, which is a recommendation engine that is always on and automates manual investigations by automatically detecting anomalies and outliers and allowing for faster times resolution. We also announced the beta of Watchdog root cause analysis, which automatically identifies closer relationships between different issues across applications infrastructure, and pinpoints the root cause. In addition, we continued innovating across our platform, releasing 38 features in Q1 and crossing 450 out of the box integrations. A few features to highlight include Network Performance Monitoring for Microsoft Windows, which is a very differentiated feature for Datadog NPM. New marketplace integration, including Oracle Cloud, as well as the official launch of our GovCloud instance allowing us to onboard early customers in the government space. Lastly, on the product side, I want to briefly discuss our acquisition of Sqreen, which closed in early April. We find it Datadog to breakdown silos between Dev and Ops teams and as we've discussed previously, we are working to extend that to security teams as well. Stream is an application security solution that actively detects attacks and can track trace them down to the impacted function call. It prevents application security exploits and enables response across development, security and upstream. We are very excited at the combination of Sqreen with our APM and security offerings, as we expect it to allow our customers to protect APM submitted applications with very little additional friction. And we will share updates as we progress with integrating external platform. Now, let's switch gears and move on to sales and marketing. I am very proud of the continued productivity from our go-to-market team. As we mentioned last quarter, we have been hiring at a rapid pace across our sales order, and are seeing more teams and reps becoming productive. Now, let's discuss of our wins this quarter. First, we had a seven-figure land was one of the world's largest consulting firms undergoing a multi-billion dollar cloud migration. With Datadog they have reduced their monitoring costs by more than 35% with greater visibility into every layer of their stack, including several functions. Next, we had a six-figure or high tech figure, I should say, land deal was a major transportation company. The company is moving towards a DevOps culture, but was hindered by a proliferation of siloed and underutilized monitoring tools. After implementing Datadog engineers now have a single easy to use platform that facilitates mass adoption. Next, we had a six-figure land from the largest supermarket chain. The company has 1000s of stores and is in the process of migrating from legacy IT to an Azure based cloud. Datadog unified platform help enable this migration and reduce mean time to resolution by up to 50%. Next, I want to discuss a seven-figure up sales EVA online gaming company. Prior to Datadog business units were spending too much time responding to incident and look for a single source of truth visibility across all teams and systems. This company reduce its usage from eight observability tools to one and Datadog is also used by executives all the way up to the CEO. Last, we had a seven-figure up sale to an existing million dollar plus customer in the financial services. During COVID this large enterprise accelerated its digital transformation journey as they enhanced their digital tools and money presence. And it continues to grow with Datadog as they migrate more workloads to the cloud and have adopted newer products like NPM and Synthetics. Moving on now to a longer term outlook. While the pandemic continues to impact the macro environment, businesses are starting to turn to priorities in the post-COVID world. Business is must be digital first, which we expect will move forward digital transformation projects, massive IT platforming is still in its early stages. We believe we are in a great position with a unified observability platform. While there is the possibility for more near term volatility caused by the macro environment, we are increasingly confident in our ability to execute and in our long-term opportunity. Before handling the call to David, there are two changes to the management team I would like to bring to your attention. First, our Chief Revenue Officer, Dan Fougere will transition out of the company this quarter to take some well deserved time off after a few decades of hard work. We are very grateful to Dan for many quarters of growth and for developing a world class organization. We are confident that the team is built will continue carrying the torch and will exceed expectations, the data the way. We also running a search for new CRO, now evaluating both internal and external candidates. Second, I'm pleased to announce that we will soon be joined by our first ever Chief Operating Officer, Adam Blitzer, who joins us after a successful tenure as an EVP and GM at Salesforce. Adam will help us scale as a SaaS platform company and will oversee a number of our front office functions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. David? Yes, so great question. I think we are seeing a lot of adoption from APM, I think anyway, we back an eternity ago, when we took the company public, we were saying that APM probably had a bit of a longer fuse to it, but had a very long runway as more and more applications move to the cloud and more than become critical, and that's what we see happen today. In terms of our penetration among customer application, that keeps up with the ratio of the \u2013 let's call it the instances or containers that are covered with APM from the total recycling containers that we see for infrastructure monitoring. There is quite a bit of runway in there, but that ratio is already higher than the famous Gartner Quadrant of 5% applications being monitored. So we think we're clearly targeting to build applications in major cloud environments. We are starting to see from some of our larger enterprise customers, some of their on-prem applications that are being instrumented with our APM as well, but I would say that's more of a Phase 2 of adoption as opposed to what we have and how we start with customers. I think it's a combination of \u2013 there is a lot of market need, because networking, especially in next-generation cloud environment, and especially for companies that have one foot in the cloud and one foot in prem, is not something that is well covered in terms of monitoring and understanding, so there is a big need there. And the second part of that is, as you mentioned, the product maturity, I mean, that product is getting better and better, it covers more and more of the use cases, which means it goes from being great for a small number of customers to be in great form larger and larger fraction of our market and customer data. When do we switching off that is what we announced \u2013 mentioned in the call today, which is the our performance monitoring today also works for Microsoft, Windows. And as it turns out, it's very differentiated to have a cloud-based network performance monitoring product that also works on Microsoft, Windows, and it helps a lot of those customers with very hybrid deployment. Well, the thinking is we need to scale the team. We \u2013 fast forward a few years will be a lot bigger, and we're building a platform, there is a number of things that we'll need to do, right and there is a number of \u2013 there is going to be a number of times to solve along the way. And it was always given that we need to grow the bandwidth of the senior management team. And as we embarked on that, we also thought to bring into the company some experience with later stages of scale and growth look like for SaaS companies, and especially SaaS platform companies, which explains to you the hire we're making here. Yes, it's a great question. And the focus is actually on a lot of the [indiscernible] function. And these are going to have to do with servicing our customers and growing our customers. I won't go into too much details \u2013 our teams are \u2013 like, we have a fairly idiosyncratic setup for how we go-to-market and how we serve customers. That is aligned with our learn and expand low friction model. But, Adam is going to lead a number of those teams. And focus is outwards instead inwards. So it's really more of a greenfield opportunity. Today, customers typically don't have anything or they have something it's not really deployed. And the reason for that is that to inject application security inside the application, there's actually quite a bit of friction. Where the combination with Datadog and with our APM makes sense is that we've already incurred that friction to instrument the application with APM and the point of infection is the same. And that's where we think the proverbial one plus one equals three happens by adding Sqreen to Datadog. And I should say, it's only going to be the start, right. I mean, we \u2013 there's a lot more we want to do in application security. In the rest of security, the first step is we need to plug the detection protection directly at the APM level with Sqreen. Well, there's many. Look to the \u2013 it seems like every other month, there's a large scale attack that brings a new array of security into focus. But the way we see the world and the way it leads to us, we're focusing on applications in the cloud. And for that, we think there are important aspects of it that happen at the application level, which is what we're addressing with Sqreen. There are important aspects of it, that are happening at the infrastructure level. And we have a few different products that we started last year. And that we're still developing and shipping around that, then there's one big part of it that has to do with putting all this information together into an actionable system of record. In the on-prem world would be a team. We also have a product, a security monitoring product that is a precursor to a team that we're building into a team that's not there yet. So we really intend to cover that whole spectrum specifically for applications to the cloud, and specifically for use cases that are going to bring together DevOps and security. In general, when you think of the problems companies have in this current environment. The first one is that the tooling is very bare bones, most of it doesn't exist or is too high friction, it doesn't get developed, it doesn't get deployed. But the other thing that happens in most of the companies that is really, really hard to operationalize security because it's hard to get that in ops and security to be on the same page and work together. And that's where I think we can make a big difference if we use our platform the right way and if we build those products right. So for us, it's really a growth driver, right. I think when you look at Datadog, we have plenty of efficiency. And the way we think about everything is how do we get the biggest part of that market, which we think is going to be gigantic? How do we build the products we need to get to all that? How do we reach all the customers across all regions in all segments to get there so that's how we think about it. So when we look at our partner program, we see it to that lens, and we are very happy with the adoptions we've had there. There's a number of things we need to do still, I mean, it's still I would say very early, we have validating wins, like we've talked about some of those in previous calls. But there's a lot more we want to build over the next year. I would say so, more specific update in this quarter. But I do expect that we'll talk about it again. Yes, so first of all, on pricing and price push back. Look, we have customers that pay us more than $10 million a year. I knew that somebody's paying them $10 million a year and is not asking for a lower price. But look, at the end of the day, the way we think about it is this is very high leverage thing for our customers. And this is a tiny compared to what they spend on their infrastructure and on their engineering teams. And the way we think about pricing for all the data and everything they send us is that these models are going to grow exponentially over time. They're going to grow faster than these customers top line for all practical purposes. And so pricing will have to adapt, how smart we are about getting, interpreting that data, or how we price and how we structure the model that is customers care more and more with us. I will say that while we do have pricing conversation with customers, especially large ones, we don't see the kind of competitive pressure, you might imagine if you read the competition in the marketing website. The best illustration of that would be, David mentioned in the call that we had gross retention in the mid-90s. And this is stable across various segments of our customers. Also stable across products if you take each of our infrastructure APM and logs products individually, you see the same numbers. What this tells you is that there's very little that goes away. There's not a lot of room there for control price-driven competition. So, I have the usual boring answer, which is that we don't really see any change to the competitive landscape. It's a bit early for me to comment on the Splunk announcements, because if they just did that yesterday, but from what we could see, it seems to be somewhat announcement from the repackaging of the product they had been doing for the past few quarters, and that we had seen in the market. So there's no big change of surprise. And on the other side, that we don't see from anybody else, we don't see any big change that is impacting us much. The biggest impact of competitive announcements I see is, is typically the day of the announcement where somebody has to figure out what's going on and explain it. And that's about it. We don't \u2013 we are not condition given a productive document, and we also know condition given in our go to market. Also we were so first of all, we fully \u2013 we all only know OpenTelemetry as well. And to us, it's not a change, right, our agent was Open-source already. It's \u2013 it was free for everybody, including our competition to reduce. We lean into open source format and libraries to instrument obligations for a very long time. And we support a large number of them. The way we see the problem is not like what matters is not with technology we use to get from here to there. What matters is to solve the end to end problem for our customers. And to make it as easy as possible for them to just plug us in and everything just work everything to show that we don't get our mess, a gigantic mess with all these different technologies and applications and clouds, everything else. We turn that into something that the understanding is well ordered, without any effort. That's what we hit the market in the end. And that's what we see all of this and device bits and pieces that appear in the middle like the format's and the libraries and everything else is will change and it has changed, will change its doesn't matter. Well, so far it's working. I think, look, we do have a fairly differentiated go to market and the way we organize internally, which to know where we land. We'll end with and hope customers adopt your product, and how they learn about those products. So, it doesn't rely on having every single sales rep, understanding every single little feature we have in every product to product, that wouldn't be practical. So it is working, we're very confident in that. I would say, there's a point at which we might have to consider tweaking the way we go to market. And I think that we'll have to do more with when we start actively selling to what might be different buyers. And I think we've discussed this before. But as I'm thinking more specifically of the security market, we're not there yet. We're not actively pushing to the security buyers today with our product. But when that happens, we might have to make some tweaks, win a day. So, we don't have any, any numbers to share on that. I will say that, a lot of the historically a lot of that has been informal in that we work alongside the provider, but there's no formal agreement or RevShare and everything else. We started to put some of those in place more recently, around the committed resources for going to market jointly, things like that. But we didn't have anything to share on that. Go ahead David. Yes, so on a gross margin, so the way we think about this is due to us having the product teams work on product development, instead of working on optimizing, and we're still happy with gross margins where they are, they might still fluctuate, they probably would fluctuate a bit lower than they were last year because we're very busy building product. But there's nothing fundamentally changed around our margin. And there's many other things we can do in the future to optimize if we so wish. So right now the call we're making is we focus on product development, we focus on making sure that we grow the top-line in the short and mid-term and then we \u2013 if things get out of hand on the gross margin side, we'll spend some more time on optimization. Yes, there's really nothing to read to it. I think it's a continuation of what we have. Right now where we have a deep bench on the leadership side, we're very happy with the leadership we have in place. And we'll still be looking at going to be looking for a new CRO, and we're going to be looking at candidates both internally and externally for that, but there's no willing desire to change course or anything fundamentally different from where we were. Do you want to take? I'll start with that. So we had, it was very broad based across industries, we had a combination of customers that we brought on with the strong new logos in the second half of the year, and in Q1 begin to ramp because we are land and expand. And customers that were already using us and have been using us for a year or more increase their activities. We think it has a lot to do with the increase of activity on digital transformation and workloads. As in previous quarters, about two thirds of the increase of usage was from customers using more of the products they had purchased in the previous period and about one third was a cross sell or new and that continued in the quarter. So it was a combination of new logos, increased usage of existing products, and very robust cross selling and adoption of the bought one. It was very, it was brought all that, all three of those were positive in terms of both the scaling of new customers, the cross-sell and the increased usage of existing products. Well, I think it's at this point, I'm losing track of what we're comparing to that pre pandemic level. So far back, but we love we're very happy with what happened over the Q3, Q4 and Q1. We had a very, very strong Q1. We still think, we don't know what the macro is going to who is going to impact us we still think the, because all customers are having an affected the same way, the same time. We just feel a bit more uncertain. There used to be, but look, we feel good about the business, right. I think we just increase the guidance for the full year. I think it went from 38% so close to 47%. That should tell you that we forget about where we are in about the business. Thank you. And in closing, I would just want to reiterate that we're very, very pleased with our performance to start the year. That I am personally very proud of our execution that I want to thank all of our employees or Datadog's for the continued hard work. Thank you all."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. We had a very strong start to the year revenues was $198.5 million, up 51% year-over-year against the challenging year ago comp. Usage trends were strong and show broad-based growth. New logo generation continues to be strong and customers continue to adopt more products across the platform. To provide some more context first, growth of existing customers was robust again, and our dollar base net retention rate remained above 130% for the 15 consecutive quarter. We are pleased with the usage growth of existing customers, which indicates continued adoption of our platform and continued migration to the cloud even in the face of macro pressures. As Oliv mentioned, usage growth was stronger than expected and above historical levels and usage growth was broad base across our customer base. Also, we added a record number of 100,000 plus customers in the quarter given our land and expand model, a majority of these ads were existing customers. In addition, we had a strong uptick in the quarter in million dollar customers. Next, our new logo results were strong. In fact, it was our second best new logo, ARR quarter ever, and a record for Q1. Contributions were strong across our enterprise and commercial sales channels. Earlier Olivier shared several large new logo wins across more traditional industries and encouraging sign as companies across a wide spectrum, start embracing digital transformation projects. Remember that given our uses based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue. Next in the first quarter we saw continued strength, as Olivier discussed in our platform strategy, with 75% of our customers using two or more products, and 25% of our customers now using for more products, up from only 12% a year ago. Next churn was consistent with historical levels. This demonstrates the importance of our solution to our customers. Our dollar base gross retention rate has remained largely unchanged in the mid-90s. And this was true across customer segments, and in each of our infrastructure, APM and log products. Taken together, this resulted in a record quarter of ARR at over $100 million and up significantly versus Q1 last year. Now turning to billing. Billings worth $220 million, up 59% year-over-year, there were no major proforma impacts to call out in the quarter. Remaining performance obligations are RPOs was $464 million, up 81% year-over-year. Contract duration continued to be at an increased level from the year-ago period. RPO strength is driven by strong annual billings and commitments, as well as a few large multi year commits. It is important to know that those multiyear commits are billed annually. And we do not incentivize our sales force for multiyear deals given our high net retention. Current RPO growth was also strong in the high 60%. As a reminder, billings and RPO can fluctuate versus revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the signing of customer contracts, while revenue incorporates customer usage. Now, let's review the income statement in more detail. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $153 million, representing a gross margin of 77%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and 80% in the year ago period. The slight decrease in gross margin as we've discussed before is due to our investments in product and platform innovation. We expect gross margin to continue to be slightly down from last year in the remainder of the year, as we build out new cloud data centers and prioritize product development. R&D expense was $61 million, or 31% of revenue, compared to 27% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest significantly in R&D, including a high growth in our engineering head count. Engineering head count continues to grow slightly ahead of the pace of revenue growth and we have been able to attract talent and are successfully executing on our hiring and onboarding plans, despite COVID. Sales and marketing expense was $53 million, or 28% of revenues, compared to 32% in the year ago period. Similar to R&D, we continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing. But the pace of the revenue growth has outpaced pace investment growth. This was another quarter of no in-person trade shows and marketing events. And while we have successfully redeployed much of the events budget to advertising and other lead generating activities, it is not on a one-for-one ratio. G&A expense was $16 million or 8% of revenue, slightly lower than the 9% in the year ago quarter and operating income was $20 million or a 10% operating margin compared to an operating income of $16 million or 12% in the year ago period. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $20 million or $0.06 a share, based on $344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash from operation was a strong $52 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $44 million for margin of 22%. Free cash flow was driven by strong collections stemming from our strong billings in Q4 and Q1. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2021. We believe we can deliver high growth for the foreseeable future, as we are addressing a very large greenfield market and are executing well against that opportunity. We are optimistic about the long-term opportunity and have seen an uptick in metrics driving our business growth. Taking this into account with our usual conservativism implies, we're updating our guidance as follows. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $211 million to $213 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 51% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.03 to $0.04 per range, based on an approximate 344 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year 2021, revenues are expected to be in the range of $880 million to $890 million, which represents a 47% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.16 per share based on $345 million weighted average diluted shares. Now, some notes on our guidance, while usage growth was strong in Q1, when providing guidance as usual, we use more conservative assumptions. Next, our strategic focus remains investing to optimize for the long-term. Therefore, we are planning to continue aggressive investments in R&D and go-to-markets throughout 2021. We believe the efficiencies of our business are evident, and we are confident in our ability to be a sizeable and materially profitable company over the long-term. Additionally, our model assumes the return to the office and a resumption of travel and in-person events in the second half of the year. We have limited visibility on these topics, but believe it's prudent to incorporate this in our outlook. Finally, in early April, we closed our acquisition of screen. We are pleased to welcome more than 50 members of the screen team today to dock. The acquisition has an immaterial impact on our income statement. And our cash flow statement in Q2 will reflect the $190 million of cash that we paid for the acquisition. Now below the operating income line. We expect approximately $1 million of Q2 non-GAAP other income, which is net including the interest income on our cash and marketable securities, less the interest expense on our convertible debt. We do not expect to be a federal taxpayer in 2021, but have a tax provision related to our international entity. We expect the tax provision to be approximately $700,000 in Q2 and $3 million for the full year. Now to summarize, we are very pleased with the results of the quarter. Customers continue to consume more Datadog, both in terms of usage and cross selling to newer products, and the execution remained strong. We believe the importance of our solutions will only be strengthened long-term by the continued trends of cloud migration and digital transformation. And now, with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yes, the billings duration we said, it's in the seven \u2013 around seven months and the contract duration spread out towards \u2013 more towards a year and then nine plus months. And it's maintain that so what we saw was over the last couple quarters, given the multi-year contracts and the increase of annual billing, the contract duration increased. Yes. Let me just take that as a metric. We said we were going to announce that once a year and give some comment on flavors. So, we're not going to give the number but, it was a \u2013 it's a strong uptick. And as we talked about, it has a lot to do with the expansion of customers into that $1 million range. As far as a concentration in the quarter, nothing out of the ordinary, we continue to have some very needy labs, but given the land and expand model and the number of customers bring on we don't have a concentration that produces a quarter. It's the way we see. Yes, sorry... Yes, it pulled in, and we talked about in Q3 as risk management happened. And then we said in Q4, both billings and contract duration pulled back out basically, in billings, in the seven to eight and contract duration nine, 10s around that. And it has to do with, client preferences. And we continued to have that same sort of duration in Q1 that we had in Q4. So it's very similar to the trend we talked about last time, which is more duration on contracts year-over-year but between Q4 and Q1, there really wasn't much change in the way clients approached the contracting. Europe, let me take that. Europe has been strong for us. We have not seen the slower vaccination attract and we have seen, pretty good resumption of growth across all the geographies. We'll have to continue to watch it because there's variation in back to work and back to office but as it relates to Q1 and Q4 we saw fairly uniform strength across the regions. Yes, so very happy with the product being very strong out of the gate. We don't have any numbers to share. And just to explore early in its cycle that is still number of things that we need to do to the product so that, it works well for everyone who wants to use it. But it's a product that is very beloved by its users put it this way. So it's got a very strong fan, a feeling that they can give you."

We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a solid Q4 to end a strong fiscal year 2022. We delivered significant new innovations for our customers, we saw increasing adoption of our products and we attracted thousands of new customers to our platform. Meanwhile, we delivered strong revenue growth, margins, non-GAAP operating profit, and we generated more than $350 million in free cash flow. Let me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. In Q4, revenue was $469 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year, 8% quarter-over-quarter and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 23,200 customers, up from about 18,800 last year.  We ended the quarter with about 2,780 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,010 last year. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. And we had 317 customers with ARR of $1 million or more compared to the 216 we had at the end of last year.  We generated free cash flow of $96 million with a free cash flow margin of 21%. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted more products. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 81% of customers were using two or more products, up from 78% a year ago. 42% of customers were using four or more products, up from 33% a year ago. And 18% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 10% last year.  Now moving on to this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we observed slower usage growth with existing customers while continuing to scale our new logo acquisition and new product cross-sells. Starting with usage. Usage growth of existing customers in Q4 was overall slightly lower than what we observed in Q2 and Q3, which we attribute first to a continuation of cloud cost optimization by our larger spending customers; and second, to a seasonal annual slowdown in the second half of December that was more pronounced than in previous years.  As in Q2 and Q3, we continue to see more optimization from customers as a larger cloud footprint, while our smaller spending customers are exhibiting higher growth. From a product perspective, we didn't see meaningful differences among our major products as they all experienced solid growth, albeit decelerating on a year-over-year basis. In contrast to this deceleration in usage growth for existing customers, we continue to execute on new logo lands and multiproduct adoption, and we also continue to see stable, very strong growth retention trends.  First, we had our strongest new logo quarter to date with a record level of new logo ARR bookings. Second, our sales pipeline remains healthy as our pattern of new logo and cross-sell is scaling above the levels of the past years, and we see demand growing along with our investments in go to market.  I'd also like to point out that although we have made steady progress, we still see significant opportunities to grow our penetration in total spend amounts with larger customers. As a data point, as of January 2023, 37% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, up from 30% last year.  For these customers, the median Datadog ARR is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. This leaves a very large opportunity for us to go with these customers as they continue to move towards the cloud and more of them develop. We are also pleased with the initial take-up of some of our newest products, including Cloud Cost Management, for which we already added a mid-6-figure commitment last month from a global fast-food chain. And finally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention steady in the mid-to high 90s. We believe this high retention number is indicative of the business criticality of Datadog for our customers. Now let's move on to R&D. During the quarter, we released our latest product to general availability, Universal Service Monitoring, which detects all micro services across an organization environment and provide instant visibility into their health and dependencies, or's without changes.  Universal Service Monitoring bridges our existing monitoring and application performance monitoring capabilities and it involves end-to-end obviability with minimal deployment friction. Now let's take a moment to review the R&D team's accomplishments in 2022. We ended the year with 17 generally available products, up from 13 at the end of 2021, and we greatly expanded the capabilities of our existing products.  Overall, in 2022, we have meaningfully broadened our observability capabilities and pushed forward in making each product best of breed. Meanwhile, we have made meaningful progress but remain in early days in the new areas of cloud security and developer experience. In observability, we continue to expand our end-to-end unified platform.  We now have more than 600 integrations, including all the latest products on AWS, GCP and Azure. We launched new AI capabilities, such as Watchdog logs and detection to help customers separate signal from noise in data and Watchdog good cause analysis to identify the root cause of issues and quantify their impact in customers.  We launched Cloud Cost Management to have customers take control of their infrastructure costs. We announced service satalog to manage service ownership at scale. We made Observability Pipelines generally available, enabling customers to collect and transform data from any source to any destination or at petabyte scale.  We launched Audit Trail to help customers achieve their compliance and governance goals. We extended Sensitive Data Scanner beyond logs to inspect APM and RAM data flows, and we now collect data from SNMP traps to provide greater visibility into physical network equipment. In cloud security, we kept building out our platform. We launched a Cloud Security Management, our rich context-aware CNAP platform. We launched Application Security Management, building on our acquisition of Sqreen in 2021, and we announced the beta of native protection to block malicious sectors directly within the data platform.  In developer experience, we are expanding on our CI Visibility product. We introduced continuous testing to bring efficient and reliable testing within CI/CD pipelines, and we launched a beta of intelligence Test Runners, which significantly reduces the time and cost of running tests.  And last but not least, we delivered a number of platform-wide initiatives. We achieved FedRAMP moderate authorization and have since landed a number of government agencies as customers. Our customers today can also use Sqreen for collaboration, incident response per programming and debugging less than a year after the acquisition, and we continue to expand on the HIPAA and PCI compliance of our products. As you can tell, we've been busy, and I want to thank the R&D team for a very productive year. Looking ahead to 2023, our teams are continuing to push forward as beta products from 2022 include data streams monitoring, workflow automation, even correlation, heat maps, dynamic instrumentation, workload security profiling, resource catalog and native protection, among others. We also continue to integrate our 2022 acquisitions, Sqreen, HD, Secret and Cloud Craft into the Datadog platform, and we are excited for their potential. In summary, we're looking forward to delivering many more capabilities to help our customers in 2023. Now let's move on to sales and marketing. Our go-to-market teams continue to execute very well into the end of 2022, in particular on new logo lands. So, let's go over a few of our wins this quarter. First, we signed a 7-figure land with a Fortune 500 industrial group. This company was using multiple open source and built-in cloud monitoring tools, which led to release delays and consumer-facing outages. In addition to our metric traction log, this company will rely on our ability to integrate open telemetry data sources to deliver immediate value. This customer's initial deal includes 13 products across our observability, security and developer experience categories. Next, we signed a 7-figure land with a Fortune 500 financial services company. This customer is moving hundreds of applications from on-prem to the cloud and multiple legacy tools were creating gaps in visibility and post-PCI compliance problems. This customer today is looking at savings of roughly $1 million in the first year of using Datadog and a meaningful reduction in mean time to resolution. This deal will start with infrastructure monitoring and replace three different tools with plans to expand to other Datadog products in the future. Next, we signed a 7-figure land deal with a major federal government agency. This agency was looking to reduce tools sprawl and aimed at a rapid rollout to hundreds of different programs while saving money on engineering and issue resolution. This agency is among a number of new government customers in 2022, following our FedRAMP moderate authorization. And this deal is expected to displace at least eight commercial legacy monitoring tools. Next, we signed a 7-figure land deal with a leading Japanese system integrator. This company has been a very successful hardware system integrator and is looking to grow its digital and cloud transformation business. This customer plans to add up 15 Datadog products in order to support its ambitious growth plan. And last for today, we signed a multimillion-dollar expansion with one of the world's leading insurance companies. Prior to using Datadog, this company was using more than 30 tools across nine business units. By consolidating onto Datadog, the customer estimates it's achieved roughly 115% ROI all within a year while reducing average mean time to resolution for 1.5 hours to 15 minutes. With this renewal, this company is adding database monitoring, cloud security management and application security management and is now using 12 Datadog products. That is for this quarter's customer highlights. And again, I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their great execution in Q4 and throughout 2022. Now let me speak to our longer-term outlook and my thoughts on 2023. Although we are seeing customers be more cautious with their cloud usage expansion in the near term. we see no change to the long-term trends towards digital transformation and cloud migration.  We think it's healthy for customers to optimize, and we believe that the ability to correct course and continually align the nature and scale of their applications with their business needs is one of the key benefits of cloud transformation.  At Datadog, we have always organized our products and our business around helping customers gain agility and reduce costs, and we do it by enabling stronger business performance and efficient use of their engineering and infrastructure spend. Regardless of near-term macro pressure, we believe it is still early days, and we expect that companies worldwide will continue to grow their next footprint to deliver value to their customers. Given the large opportunities we see in front of us, we plan to keep building and innovating. We have already made progress in observability, but we still have much to do to deliver more value and solve more problems for our customers. And we are excited about our opportunities in cloud security, developer experience as well as our early efforts in areas around ITSM and real-time business intelligence.  As we have since we founded Datadog, we are also balancing long-term investments against maintaining the discipline to ensure our continual financial performance. We recognize that the macro environment remains uncertain. So, while we continue to focus on scaling and investing, we are growing those investments in a disciplined fashion in 2023, and David will discuss this in more detail. We remain confident in our long-term opportunities, and we are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to catch up them. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. In Q4, we continued to execute well and delivered value to our customers. Revenue was $469 million, up 44% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of our Q4 performance, first, we saw existing customer usage growth in October and November at a similar level to what we saw in Q2 and Q3.  In the month of December, we saw a slower growth dynamic as the typical slowdown we see at the end of December was more pronounced than in previous years. As a result, the growth rate in usage by existing customers was lower in Q4 than in Q2 and Q3.  Next, similar to Q2 and Q3, we saw larger-spending customers grow slower than smaller spending customers. As with Q2 and Q3, we saw relatively more deceleration in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food delivery. Geographically, we saw solid and relatively similar growth across all regions.  As Olivier discussed, we experienced strong new logo ARR growth and low churn again in this quarter. We had a record level of new logo bookings in the quarter across customer sizes. Our dollar net base net retention remained at strong levels, above 130% for the 22nd consecutive quarter. And gross revenue retention has remained unchanged over the last several quarters and remained steady in the mid-to high 90s. We believe this high and steady gross retention points to the mission-critical nature of the Datadog platform for our customers. Now moving on to our financial results. Billings in the quarter were $536 million, up 31% year-over-year. Billings duration was slightly lower year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.06 billion, up 30% year-over-year. And RPO duration declined on a year-over-year basis, and we note that current RPO growth was in the high 30s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $378 million, representing a gross margin of 81%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and also 80% in the year ago quarter.  We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs, reflected in our cost of goods sold in this quarter. In the mid- to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range. Our Q4 non-GAAP OpEx grew 54% year-over-year as we continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market. Q4 operating income was $83 million or an 18% operating margin compared to an operating income of $71 million or a 22% operating margin in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, the year ago operating margin benefited from lack of in-person office, travel and event costs due to our COVID policies during the pandemic. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $114 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $96 million for a free cash flow margin of 21%. Now for our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers compared to historical periods. And as usual, we are basing our near-term guidance on recent activity we see with our customers. We are incorporating an expectation for seasonally weaker growth in the first quarter due to the subdued growth in the month of December that creates a lower growth trajectory to start the first quarter. While our customers are continuing to expand with us, we are assuming in our guidance that cloud optimization continues to affect our expansion rate in 2023. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $466 million to $470 million, which represents a 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $68 million to $72 million or an operating margin of 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.07 billion to $2.09 billion, which represents a 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million for a margin of 15% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.09 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now some additional notes on the guidance. First, regarding our fiscal year 2023 investments, we continue to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large long-term opportunities. Our non-GAAP operating income guidance reflects this discipline. We will continue to grow our R&D and go-to-market teams as we broaden our platform in service of our customer needs, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.  As a result, we are planning to grow our operating expenses, including COGS, in the fiscal year 2023 in the low 30s percent range year-over-year. We plan to grow our headcount in fiscal year 2023 in the mid-20s percent range year-over-year. This compares to fiscal 2022 headcount growth of approximately 50% year-over-year. Next, as interest rates have risen, our interest income has increased and become more meaningful. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $75 million. We expect tax expense in fiscal year 2023 to be $11 million to $13 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the range of 4% to 5% of revenues in fiscal year 2023.  To reiterate Olivier's comments, we see no change to our long-term opportunities as our customers embark and expand on their cloud migration and digital transformation plans. We remain strongly positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with these journeys.  I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in 2022, and I'm excited about our plans for the next year.  With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you, very much. Olivier, I was wondering if you can comment on the AWS infrastructure monitoring portion of the business specifically. Do you see that trending above or below the 25% rate of the total business this year? And I'm wondering if you perhaps see some of the other hyperscale\u2019s, Azure, Google, et cetera, gaining any share of that mix during this year? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So, look, we -- obviously, we see -- we get data from our customers using those cloud providers. We also listen to the commentary that cloud providers provide on their -- in terms of their own growth. There's not a one-to-one mapping between what happens on the revenue side for the cloud providers and what we see on the infrastructure side on our end. But we are seeing some of the same trends where their growth slowed down throughout Q4. And we've been listening to their comments when they give guidance for what that growth might look like in the near future, which also inform our own guidance.  In terms of the mix shift, we don't see anything that differs from the trends we saw throughout the last year. I think the story there is they're also seeing optimization from some of the customers, that means the largest customers. And on our end, we expect that optimization to continue throughout the year. That's what we built into our guidance.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Understood. And then, David, I believe you mentioned record new logo ARR bookings in the quarter. Great to hear. I think we're wondering what you attribute that to just given the environment is so challenging. And there was mention of several of these companies landing with eight or 10 or 15 Datadog products and replacing legacy tools or replacing open source.  Do you see an increase in those kinds of consolidation opportunities and maybe just a broadening where this landscape is viewing Datadog as the converged observability leader and wanting to consolidate in that direction?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. In Q4, and I think going forward, we continue to see greenfield and new projects, new workloads being the majority of the driver, but have seen over the quarters, and we talked about some of them in our prepared remarks, consolidation opportunities, when a client is already in their cloud journey and has workloads and is looking to get a platform, create efficiencies, et cetera. They have increasingly been consolidating on Datadog and we see continued opportunities for that. Yes. And I'll add to that. We see demand scaling basically. Like we're still early in cloud migration and diesel transformation, and we see no slowdown from companies going from legacy IT to this new world. That's why we get more and more renewals and more volume there. The part of the business we see going slower is the larger customers that are further along in this cloud transformation that have large workloads trying to optimize because that's where they can meaningfully set cost.\nMark Murphy: Thank you, very much.\nOperator: We have a question from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about product innovation. And in some sense, you guys have had a pretty impeccable track record of leasing a lot of product that sort of benefited your customers over the last couple of years. But given sort of the environment that exists today, do you feel that in some sense, Datadog gets viewed by customers as sort of a Lamborghini type observability solution, meaning that are you -- in terms of customers may not need all of the bells and whistles that a 17-product portfolio can provide? Any thoughts there on whether Datadog may be potentially overengineered for in terms of customers' willingness to spend in the current environment?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So, I definitely don't think we position ourselves as the Lamborghini. We are not -- the Lamborghini have a glove box and needs to go to the shop every two weeks. That's definitely not us. Would -- we have been investing heavily in product innovation. We have a lot of products today that, thanks to this acceleration of product and innovation over the past few years, are early in their life cycle.  What we see in the current environment is that it is actually helping us get to these consolidation deals that were mentioned a little bit earlier because we can cover more of what our customers need to do and drive more efficiencies. Again, it's still early in that because many of those products are early in their life cycle. So, they might not be applicable to every single type of customer and every single type of situation.  But I think this is validating our destination there. And it shows we need to do more of that. not less. At a time where larger customers are very, very careful about their spend, it might be more difficult for some of those products to gain a lot of adoption with any particular customer at a very high level of spend. So, we're focusing today on getting a maximum number of those customers to adopt those products and plant the seeds of future growth as they further consolidate and move to the cloud.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. And just a follow-up on those larger customers who are seeing their usage trends slow more than smaller customers. Relative to the commitment, how are you guys sort of handling that? Are you in a situation where you're rolling over credits? Or are you sort of enforcing sort of the take-or-pay aspect of the contract? Any color there on how you're working with those larger customers in terms of where they stand relative to their commitment?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. We are -- so we always want to partner with customers and build a long-term relationship with them. We've had some customers that have run into very significant business headwinds, where their own businesses have contracted quite a bit. And in those situations, we always work with them to structure the contracts and make sure we get to a better outcome.  We've done that with one of our major customers over the past quarter. And we've had similar conditions with some other customers as well. So that's part of with customers also part of the guidance we're giving for the year.\nDavid Obstler: And I just want to add that because we tend, as you know, to go land and expand and our customers tend to undercommit relative to what they eventually get to, we haven't seen across the customer base, a very meaningful increase of sort of unused commitments. And so that's something about our go-to-market that creates flexibility with clients to commit as they see usage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thank you very much. Just one real quick one, David. I know billings isn't necessarily the best metric to sort of focus on, but 1Q is a really monstrous comp. So maybe any color you can provide as we should think about billings, especially with changes in duration in calendar '23 and maybe lower commits upfront from customers on renewal?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. I think -- again, I think it is really driven by the ARR and linearity of that. So, I don't think we plan for billings, et cetera. We essentially have had billings, as you know, go above and below the revenue based on the billings in that period. And so, we don't see really any change in that type of pattern. But again, bring everyone back to ARR and revenues as the major economic driver.\nBrad Reback: That's great. And then, Oli, real quickly, if you look back at your business historically, there's been a fairly tight linkage between your growth rate and the hyperscale\u2019s with a multiple on it. As we sort of look forward, what types of things need to happen to expand that multiplier? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, I mean, look, we're covering more and more of the -- we're solving a bigger and bigger problem for our customers, which means we're expanding our APM [ph] and so, we can have a larger and larger multiplier over time. That's why we're investing in new categories, that's why we keep building up observability and that's why we're doing all these investments.  So that's where we're going. I think you're right, though, that the underlying wave that is -- has been a tailwind throughout the of the company was cloud migration and digital transformation. I think that we might be a bit more of a headwind over the next few quarters. But we strongly believe that it will become a tailwind again in the future.  We just can't tell you when exactly. We've listened to the calls of the hyperscale\u2019s, they can't tell you when either. We're in the same boat there. So, what we're doing today is we're focusing on the drivers of future success, which are covering more of the customer landscape sort of getting into more new logos, more geographies, more segments and also developing our products and getting those products adopted by more of these customers, which is how we're going to have accelerating growth in the future.\nBrad Reback: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fred Lee with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nFred Lee: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious about product expansion and what will help Datadog gain share as a percent of hyperscaler spend, a little bit related to Brad's question -- second question minute ago. I was wondering if we could get an update on which products you're gaining the most traction and have the greatest potential in 2023.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, so we have a lot of products that are early in their life cycle. Some of them are large categories where we are seeing larger and larger revenue and we have very ambitious plans, such as security. Some others are newer but might be a bit more topical in 2023, such as Cloud Cost Management.  So, I think it's really going to be a mix. We see some interesting early signs of Cloud Cost Management, which is still only billed to a handful of customers at this point but already seeing very large commitments from some of these customers. We called that out on the call.  So, we think it might be -- if you think of anything that might have more of an impact in the short-term term that might be one of those. But really, the way we think about all those products is how do we turn them all into major products two, three, four years out, how do we win these additional categories, and how do we become the platform of choice for consolidation in the long term? That's what we're driving towards.\nFred Lee: And just a quick follow-up on the security portion. So, with regard to the uptake of your security solutions, how would that compare -- how does that compare to the adoption patterns of infra and APM?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, it's a bit difficult to compare to infra because it was the very first thing we did in the company. We -- it's actually pretty comparable to what we've seen with APM, where it's a domain with a lot of investment required. We also have a very ambitious and very differentiated approach to it, which requires quite a bit of a build-out and quite a few things to figure out with customers. But we're also seeing continuous adoption and growth, thousands of customers using the platform.  We see it being adopted at a very large scale by very large customers, which -- some of which we also mentioned on the call today. So, we're not completely there yet. There's still a lot of work to do, but we think it's tracking well to -- with respect to what we can expect in our plan.\nFred Lee: Great. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the usage patterns of large customers versus small customers. I know you said you're -- the smaller customers were not seeing as much of a slowdown in usage. But what gives you confidence that those smaller customers just haven't reached or reacted to the slowing macro yet? And we may see maybe a slowdown in that segment going forward.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the future, right? So, we don't really have a crystal ball there. What we see, though, is that customers save money where it matters, which tends to be the very large line items, which for customers that are fairly far along into the cloud, is going to be, first, their cloud provider deals that are, again, one or two others are larger than their observability bills.  And then we're going to be affected by that and maybe with some optimization more specific to observability as well. So that's what we see there. That's why we see most of the large customers do that. On the smaller side, I'll point out that many of our smaller customers are actually very large companies that just are fairly new into the cloud and are still growing to the cloud. So, they are seeing exactly the same thing as their peers who are spending a lot more on us. It's just the part of their business that is where the spend is growing as opposed to where the spend is today and needs to be controlled.  The last thing I will say is on the very low end of our customer base, we do see impact of the macro environment. We have a little bit more churn at the very, very low end, which is what you see our customer count not going up as much despite us having very strong notable quarters. That's more focused at the very, very low end of the customer base, and it's not moving the numbers at all in terms of gross retention, which remains very high.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. That's great. I was also wondering; your gross margin was surprisingly strong in the quarter. I'm wondering if there's anything you can do on pricing given these large customers focus on cost optimization.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, we work with the large customers, obviously, to make sure that they get what they need. We're optimizing gross margin, obviously, we\u2019re doing quite a bit on our end to -- on the engineering side to do that. At all levels, 1% of gross margin is making a very large difference for their business, and we can reinvest that in future growth. Changing prices by 1% based on that doesn't make a big difference for customers.  I think when they -- the real way to address their concerns as they keep scaling and generating much more data and sending more observability data to us is to give them more options to process that data so that they can align with what they pay to us with the value they get. And we've been also building that on the product side. So, it's not really a pricing question. It's more of a product and structure question. And I just wonder now that we're on cost, I just want to add a little clarification. I think we talked about the trends of gross margin and what we expect for the future. And we gave some guidance as to operating expenses in 2023. I believe I might have misspoken. The operating expense guidance in 2023 in the low 30s range excludes COGS. We gave the COGS guide separately as far as our comments on that, just to clarify.\nAndrew Nowinski: Helpful. Thank you, guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKoji Ikeda: Great. Hi, Olivier. Hi, Devid. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you a question on the guidance and maybe a compare and contrast here. So, I was wondering if you could talk about maybe how to think about the levels of conservatism embedded in the full year 2023 ready guide today versus when you first gave guidance last year for 2022.\nDavid Obstler: Yes. I think we've continued to use the same approach, which is to look at the history and discount the major assumptions, which are the organic growth or the expansion of existing customers and new logos. I think the difference in the actual results were the periods of times where we saw more than pro rata or more than historical adoption and growth of existing customers, the ratio between that discount and where it ends is up actuals ended up larger. But the intent and the strategy of providing this guidance on conservative assumptions relative to that has not changed.\nKoji Ikeda: Got it. And just one quick follow-up there.\nOlivier Pomel: To be clear, our guidance doesn't assume that the optimization stops. What we've seen over the past few quarters, basically in the second half of 2022, we assume it's going to continue. We know it's going to end at some point but we don't know when exactly, so we're not building that into our guidance.\nKoji Ikeda: Got it, got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And just one follow-up here, a question on sales capacity. Just thinking about hiring plans there. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, overall headcount to grow in the mid-20s but continuing to go-to-market teams at a slower pace. So just is that mid-20s is the right way to think about sales capacity hiring this year, too?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, yes. I think that's right. We are growing our investments in go-to-market and sales capacity approximately plus or minus at the guidance we gave in headcount growth.\nOlivier Pomel: In the end, the reason for that is we still have ground to cover. We still have segment and geographies to cover. And also, as we mentioned earlier, we're having actually great success when it comes to landing new logos and new products with customers. So, our sales interactions are productive.  Our return on investment is there. So, we need to keep doing that. Again, these are the seeds of future success we are planting, and we don't intend to stop.\nDavid Obstler: I would clarify that because of the ramping nature of salespeople, the growth rate that we had, which was in excess of that 25% in 2022 means that the coming online of that ramp capacity is at a rate higher than that in 2023 as we begin to harvest the investment from that.\nKoji Ikeda: Got it. Thank guys. thanks for taking my question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks guys. Olivier, for you. Any data points around product splits? I know in the past, you've talked about APM and logs. I think it's been a couple of quarters since we had an update on the size of those businesses. But any sort of like rough magnitude of those? And are they still in hyper growth?\nOlivier Pomel: No. I mean, we see a fairly -- like when you think of the products that are a major scale today, which are APM, logs and infrastructure monitoring, those are seeing about the same trend in terms of growth in Q4. And I think that's partly because some of the optimization we see from customers happens across this -- because it happens upstream from us at the provider level.  And that's why we'll see slightly slower growth of host monitored on the cap providers or APM and also a little bit less log. Some of it happens more directly at the observability level, logs in particular or some aspects of APM that are transaction-based where we see customers optimizing there and making sure they get the best value and cut the noise.  But as a result, we see fairly similar trends across the products. So that's why we didn't call out anything specific in there. We -- in the future, I'm sure we'll share more about their relative sizes. But again, the growth rates are not that different in Q4. So, it's -- there was nothing to call out.\nMatt Hedberg: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just, David, on the guide, obviously with kind of a mid-20s revenue guide. You talked in the prepared remarks about having an NRR above 130% for almost two years. Presumably that dips below 130%. Any sort of commentary on how that might progress through the year?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. I think you're right. Implicit in that guide is below 130%. We'll report to everybody as we have that. We've seen it relate to a decel, I would say, on that, that given the change in the organic growth rate that we've been talking about starting in the middle of Q2 last year, it would be -- it's getting past that to the extent that it changes -- that changes that net retention plus or minus, given the net retention is comparison against the year-on-year customers.  So, you do have headwinds in the compare through the time that we had the change of the organic, which we had said was in the middle of Q2 of last year.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you. I wanted to ask, with respect to the slowdowns and that you've been seeing within certain customers, have you seen anything to suggest that these could be related to layoffs in tech, either because, say, that seats have been directly impacted which is because of general disruption to DevOps and engineering teams?\nOlivier Pomel: No. We say it's mostly because they can save money on their cloud bills. The -- again, one of the great things about the cloud is that the -- it's an ongoing expense. You can adjust it over time, you can restructure the way you're running applications. So, there are some norms you can use to optimize, which you can't if you're running everything on-prem, as all the costs are sunk already and confined to the future.  So, we mostly see that -- I mean, there's a little bit more noise than -- and predictability with some customers because they're having checkups, and so you need to talk to different people and they need to reorganize a little bit. So, it can add a little bit of noise on the conversations. But really, the dominant motion is the optimizing their cloud infrastructure, their cloud bill and their -- that's especially the case if they're spending a lot there.  The vast majority of our products are infrastructure usage or data volumes not per seat. So, we're not directly impacted by layoffs.\nFred Havemeyer: And then just a quick follow-up would be actually in the prepared remarks, thank you for the context on Cloud Cost Management. Can you perhaps more generally talk about your customers' interest in FinOps and how Datadog is positioned to be able to just help customers better understand both where they're spending, how they're spending and what sort of ROI they're seeing?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Our customers are definitely interested in FinOps, the larger they are, the more they are interested, and that directly relates to the work they do in cloud optimization. It's a very nascent category today. It's a nascent practice for most of our customers. And we also have a lot of experience internally running ourselves a very large cloud operation across all of the large cost cloud providers.  So that's why we believe we can build something that is fairly differentiated there. Our product there is having a great reception from customers, even though it's still early. I mentioned earlier, we signed a six-year deal, annual deal with a large restaurant chain. And we see more of that coming our way. So, we think it's one way in which we can also help our customers as they need to optimize and be more efficient in the short and midterm.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kamil with William & Blair. Your line is open.\nKamil Mielczarek: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I want to clarify one of David comments that you're incorporating seasonally weaker growth in the first quarter due to subdued growth in the month of December. Can you expand on how demand and customer conversations have trended in the first few weeks of '23 and whether that's changed since '22 year-end?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. I think you have two different avenues. I think we said in new logos, we have a strong quarter. We continue, as we mentioned, to have a strong pipeline, meaning that for new projects, new workloads, we continue to see a solid demand environment. In terms of the organic, when you have -- and this happens in most years, when you have people going on vacation and sort of reducing the amount of logs or work they're doing, you tend to see a rebound of that in January.  We did see a bit of that. But given the volatility in the market, we want to be cautious in reading too much into that. And we'll let everybody know how that plays out.\nOlivier Pomel: Mathematically, we -- the Q4 was more front loaded than back loaded in terms of whole recognized revenue. So, we entered at a lower level than -- so that's why we also have the sequential is a little bit lower there. In terms of the trends, I'll just second what David said, we -- when that seasonality was higher than we had seen in previous years, and we can explain that in different ways.  And basically, if customers are trying to save money, they're a lot more careful about turning off the lights when they leave for vacation basically. But what we see in early 2023 so far is consistent with what we see in in Q4 or in the second half of 2022 in general. So, it's too early really to pass judgment, but it really factors into our guidance, which is that we don't believe that the optimization has stopped. We assume it's going to continue. We don't know yet when going to stop. We know it's going to happen at some point, but we're not planning it for this year in our guidance.\nKamil Mielczarek: Yes, that's helpful. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. It's nice to see the large wins on the federal side. I realize it's still early, but can you update us on how big of a contribution that could be in '23? And how important are additional authorizations for expanding into that market? Or does FedRAMP moderate likely to address most of these TAM?\nOlivier Pomel: So, I mean, I can't give you specific numbers there. I know we're seeing wins low seeing engagements from the government agencies and the committees that serve them. So, all that is very good. We still have some building to do on the go-to-market teams for that.  And we also still have some things to build on the product side. Like there's more levels of certification we want to get to reach more of those customers. So, we still What I'd say is we're getting the proof points that we're fit and that customers can use us in those environments and that there is a real market for us there.\nOperator: Our next question next question comes from Sterling Auty with SVB. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Thanks. Hi, guys. Oli, I'm curious if you have any sense working and talking with customers as to when they started an optimization project, how long it actually takes them to get to that new level. Obviously, it can change if the economy gets worse, but is this something where they started and it takes them a month, a quarter to quarters? Any sense would be helpful.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So, it's a little bit hard to give an answer that fits all types of customers because they're also all going to -- they organize a little bit differently. There are different scales in there and they're going through different phases with their businesses in the economy. We've seen customers having multiple rounds of layoffs, for example, or having to adjust multiple times what they're doing with their business.  But what we see in general is that the fastest thing they can do to have an impact on the abilities to adjust some of the data they send in logs or in APM. And after that, you'll see them do a little bit more at the cloud provider level, which is higher impact in terms of their own savings, but also takes a little bit more time because we need to reorganize some of their workloads and invest more engineering time in doing that.  So, we've seen that happen with some of our customers. For a number of our customers, we saw it happen. We think they've done, and that's -- and we see them start growing again. But it's too early to call it for the rest of the customer base as again, they're all going through a fairly different things and different scale.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have a question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Oli, if you think about the trends that you saw in the second half of last year and what you're seeing year-to-date when you think about optimizations versus time line to spin up new workloads and the effect that, that has on the NRR as it progresses, when you look at the time line that you think that takes and the anniversarying of these headwinds particularly with the larger customers, how does that look from a linearity perspective over the course of the year?\nOlivier Pomel: So right now, in the guidance, we're assuming that we're seeing the same trends of growth of rising customer throughout the year. Like we're not estimating any inflection. We're assuming a continuation of that with some level of contribution compared to the actual we saw last year. That's what we are building in.  The -- again, we believe that there's going to be some reacceleration at some point as the optimization has on its course. But given the level of macro uncertainty, I think it's too difficult to -- we can't actually tell you when. Again, we've listened to the call of the cloud providers, they also can't tell you when. And so, we're being prudent with the guidance there.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then, David, maybe just one for you around cash and cash conversion, free cash flow. As we look at the year, just curious if there's any kind of different flexibility in payment terms or even just the assumption for the cash conversion from operating income to cash flow for the full guidance for fiscal '23.\nDavid Obstler: We've always said that our free cash flow has been around slightly higher than our EBIT margin. If you look back, you'll see that it's, in some quarters, a little above, in some quarters a little below. We have not seen any changes of -- any material changes in payment terms or the flows of cash. So, there's nothing we've seen so far that would cause us to change our views about cash flow conversion for the company.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Olivier Pomel for closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you all. So, I just want to take a minute to first thank our customers for trusting us with their business and partnering with us. I know some of them are going through difficult times last year and also early this year. And so, we're working with them. Potentially we all come out of it stronger. I also want to thank our employees, Datadogs everywhere around the world, for actually delivering a fantastic year in 2022, from all of the metrics we control ourselves.  We saw some slowdown in consumption with some customers, but we also delivered a lot of value for customers. We scaled our go-to-market teams. We did great in terms of landing new logos, attaching new products, shape new products that solve more problems for our customers. And we think that this bodes very well for the future. So, I'm very optimistic. I'm looking forward to a fantastic year in 2023 with everyone. And on this, I'll close the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a solid Q4 to end a strong fiscal year 2022. We delivered significant new innovations for our customers, we saw increasing adoption of our products and we attracted thousands of new customers to our platform. Meanwhile, we delivered strong revenue growth, margins, non-GAAP operating profit, and we generated more than $350 million in free cash flow. Let me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. In Q4, revenue was $469 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year, 8% quarter-over-quarter and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 23,200 customers, up from about 18,800 last year.  We ended the quarter with about 2,780 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,010 last year. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. And we had 317 customers with ARR of $1 million or more compared to the 216 we had at the end of last year.  We generated free cash flow of $96 million with a free cash flow margin of 21%. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted more products. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 81% of customers were using two or more products, up from 78% a year ago. 42% of customers were using four or more products, up from 33% a year ago. And 18% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 10% last year.  Now moving on to this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we observed slower usage growth with existing customers while continuing to scale our new logo acquisition and new product cross-sells. Starting with usage. Usage growth of existing customers in Q4 was overall slightly lower than what we observed in Q2 and Q3, which we attribute first to a continuation of cloud cost optimization by our larger spending customers; and second, to a seasonal annual slowdown in the second half of December that was more pronounced than in previous years.  As in Q2 and Q3, we continue to see more optimization from customers as a larger cloud footprint, while our smaller spending customers are exhibiting higher growth. From a product perspective, we didn't see meaningful differences among our major products as they all experienced solid growth, albeit decelerating on a year-over-year basis. In contrast to this deceleration in usage growth for existing customers, we continue to execute on new logo lands and multiproduct adoption, and we also continue to see stable, very strong growth retention trends.  First, we had our strongest new logo quarter to date with a record level of new logo ARR bookings. Second, our sales pipeline remains healthy as our pattern of new logo and cross-sell is scaling above the levels of the past years, and we see demand growing along with our investments in go to market.  I'd also like to point out that although we have made steady progress, we still see significant opportunities to grow our penetration in total spend amounts with larger customers. As a data point, as of January 2023, 37% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, up from 30% last year.  For these customers, the median Datadog ARR is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. This leaves a very large opportunity for us to go with these customers as they continue to move towards the cloud and more of them develop. We are also pleased with the initial take-up of some of our newest products, including Cloud Cost Management, for which we already added a mid-6-figure commitment last month from a global fast-food chain. And finally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention steady in the mid-to high 90s. We believe this high retention number is indicative of the business criticality of Datadog for our customers. Now let's move on to R&D. During the quarter, we released our latest product to general availability, Universal Service Monitoring, which detects all micro services across an organization environment and provide instant visibility into their health and dependencies, or's without changes.  Universal Service Monitoring bridges our existing monitoring and application performance monitoring capabilities and it involves end-to-end obviability with minimal deployment friction. Now let's take a moment to review the R&D team's accomplishments in 2022. We ended the year with 17 generally available products, up from 13 at the end of 2021, and we greatly expanded the capabilities of our existing products.  Overall, in 2022, we have meaningfully broadened our observability capabilities and pushed forward in making each product best of breed. Meanwhile, we have made meaningful progress but remain in early days in the new areas of cloud security and developer experience. In observability, we continue to expand our end-to-end unified platform.  We now have more than 600 integrations, including all the latest products on AWS, GCP and Azure. We launched new AI capabilities, such as Watchdog logs and detection to help customers separate signal from noise in data and Watchdog good cause analysis to identify the root cause of issues and quantify their impact in customers.  We launched Cloud Cost Management to have customers take control of their infrastructure costs. We announced service satalog to manage service ownership at scale. We made Observability Pipelines generally available, enabling customers to collect and transform data from any source to any destination or at petabyte scale.  We launched Audit Trail to help customers achieve their compliance and governance goals. We extended Sensitive Data Scanner beyond logs to inspect APM and RAM data flows, and we now collect data from SNMP traps to provide greater visibility into physical network equipment. In cloud security, we kept building out our platform. We launched a Cloud Security Management, our rich context-aware CNAP platform. We launched Application Security Management, building on our acquisition of Sqreen in 2021, and we announced the beta of native protection to block malicious sectors directly within the data platform.  In developer experience, we are expanding on our CI Visibility product. We introduced continuous testing to bring efficient and reliable testing within CI/CD pipelines, and we launched a beta of intelligence Test Runners, which significantly reduces the time and cost of running tests.  And last but not least, we delivered a number of platform-wide initiatives. We achieved FedRAMP moderate authorization and have since landed a number of government agencies as customers. Our customers today can also use Sqreen for collaboration, incident response per programming and debugging less than a year after the acquisition, and we continue to expand on the HIPAA and PCI compliance of our products. As you can tell, we've been busy, and I want to thank the R&D team for a very productive year. Looking ahead to 2023, our teams are continuing to push forward as beta products from 2022 include data streams monitoring, workflow automation, even correlation, heat maps, dynamic instrumentation, workload security profiling, resource catalog and native protection, among others. We also continue to integrate our 2022 acquisitions, Sqreen, HD, Secret and Cloud Craft into the Datadog platform, and we are excited for their potential. In summary, we're looking forward to delivering many more capabilities to help our customers in 2023. Now let's move on to sales and marketing. Our go-to-market teams continue to execute very well into the end of 2022, in particular on new logo lands. So, let's go over a few of our wins this quarter. First, we signed a 7-figure land with a Fortune 500 industrial group. This company was using multiple open source and built-in cloud monitoring tools, which led to release delays and consumer-facing outages. In addition to our metric traction log, this company will rely on our ability to integrate open telemetry data sources to deliver immediate value. This customer's initial deal includes 13 products across our observability, security and developer experience categories. Next, we signed a 7-figure land with a Fortune 500 financial services company. This customer is moving hundreds of applications from on-prem to the cloud and multiple legacy tools were creating gaps in visibility and post-PCI compliance problems. This customer today is looking at savings of roughly $1 million in the first year of using Datadog and a meaningful reduction in mean time to resolution. This deal will start with infrastructure monitoring and replace three different tools with plans to expand to other Datadog products in the future. Next, we signed a 7-figure land deal with a major federal government agency. This agency was looking to reduce tools sprawl and aimed at a rapid rollout to hundreds of different programs while saving money on engineering and issue resolution. This agency is among a number of new government customers in 2022, following our FedRAMP moderate authorization. And this deal is expected to displace at least eight commercial legacy monitoring tools. Next, we signed a 7-figure land deal with a leading Japanese system integrator. This company has been a very successful hardware system integrator and is looking to grow its digital and cloud transformation business. This customer plans to add up 15 Datadog products in order to support its ambitious growth plan. And last for today, we signed a multimillion-dollar expansion with one of the world's leading insurance companies. Prior to using Datadog, this company was using more than 30 tools across nine business units. By consolidating onto Datadog, the customer estimates it's achieved roughly 115% ROI all within a year while reducing average mean time to resolution for 1.5 hours to 15 minutes. With this renewal, this company is adding database monitoring, cloud security management and application security management and is now using 12 Datadog products. That is for this quarter's customer highlights. And again, I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their great execution in Q4 and throughout 2022. Now let me speak to our longer-term outlook and my thoughts on 2023. Although we are seeing customers be more cautious with their cloud usage expansion in the near term. we see no change to the long-term trends towards digital transformation and cloud migration.  We think it's healthy for customers to optimize, and we believe that the ability to correct course and continually align the nature and scale of their applications with their business needs is one of the key benefits of cloud transformation.  At Datadog, we have always organized our products and our business around helping customers gain agility and reduce costs, and we do it by enabling stronger business performance and efficient use of their engineering and infrastructure spend. Regardless of near-term macro pressure, we believe it is still early days, and we expect that companies worldwide will continue to grow their next footprint to deliver value to their customers. Given the large opportunities we see in front of us, we plan to keep building and innovating. We have already made progress in observability, but we still have much to do to deliver more value and solve more problems for our customers. And we are excited about our opportunities in cloud security, developer experience as well as our early efforts in areas around ITSM and real-time business intelligence.  As we have since we founded Datadog, we are also balancing long-term investments against maintaining the discipline to ensure our continual financial performance. We recognize that the macro environment remains uncertain. So, while we continue to focus on scaling and investing, we are growing those investments in a disciplined fashion in 2023, and David will discuss this in more detail. We remain confident in our long-term opportunities, and we are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to catch up them. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David? Yes. So, look, we -- obviously, we see -- we get data from our customers using those cloud providers. We also listen to the commentary that cloud providers provide on their -- in terms of their own growth. There's not a one-to-one mapping between what happens on the revenue side for the cloud providers and what we see on the infrastructure side on our end. But we are seeing some of the same trends where their growth slowed down throughout Q4. And we've been listening to their comments when they give guidance for what that growth might look like in the near future, which also inform our own guidance.  In terms of the mix shift, we don't see anything that differs from the trends we saw throughout the last year. I think the story there is they're also seeing optimization from some of the customers, that means the largest customers. And on our end, we expect that optimization to continue throughout the year. That's what we built into our guidance. Yes. In Q4, and I think going forward, we continue to see greenfield and new projects, new workloads being the majority of the driver, but have seen over the quarters, and we talked about some of them in our prepared remarks, consolidation opportunities, when a client is already in their cloud journey and has workloads and is looking to get a platform, create efficiencies, et cetera. They have increasingly been consolidating on Datadog and we see continued opportunities for that. Yes. And I'll add to that. We see demand scaling basically. Like we're still early in cloud migration and diesel transformation, and we see no slowdown from companies going from legacy IT to this new world. That's why we get more and more renewals and more volume there. The part of the business we see going slower is the larger customers that are further along in this cloud transformation that have large workloads trying to optimize because that's where they can meaningfully set cost. Yes. So, I definitely don't think we position ourselves as the Lamborghini. We are not -- the Lamborghini have a glove box and needs to go to the shop every two weeks. That's definitely not us. Would -- we have been investing heavily in product innovation. We have a lot of products today that, thanks to this acceleration of product and innovation over the past few years, are early in their life cycle.  What we see in the current environment is that it is actually helping us get to these consolidation deals that were mentioned a little bit earlier because we can cover more of what our customers need to do and drive more efficiencies. Again, it's still early in that because many of those products are early in their life cycle. So, they might not be applicable to every single type of customer and every single type of situation.  But I think this is validating our destination there. And it shows we need to do more of that. not less. At a time where larger customers are very, very careful about their spend, it might be more difficult for some of those products to gain a lot of adoption with any particular customer at a very high level of spend. So, we're focusing today on getting a maximum number of those customers to adopt those products and plant the seeds of future growth as they further consolidate and move to the cloud. Yes. We are -- so we always want to partner with customers and build a long-term relationship with them. We've had some customers that have run into very significant business headwinds, where their own businesses have contracted quite a bit. And in those situations, we always work with them to structure the contracts and make sure we get to a better outcome.  We've done that with one of our major customers over the past quarter. And we've had similar conditions with some other customers as well. So that's part of with customers also part of the guidance we're giving for the year. Well, I mean, look, we're covering more and more of the -- we're solving a bigger and bigger problem for our customers, which means we're expanding our APM [ph] and so, we can have a larger and larger multiplier over time. That's why we're investing in new categories, that's why we keep building up observability and that's why we're doing all these investments.  So that's where we're going. I think you're right, though, that the underlying wave that is -- has been a tailwind throughout the of the company was cloud migration and digital transformation. I think that we might be a bit more of a headwind over the next few quarters. But we strongly believe that it will become a tailwind again in the future.  We just can't tell you when exactly. We've listened to the calls of the hyperscale's, they can't tell you when either. We're in the same boat there. So, what we're doing today is we're focusing on the drivers of future success, which are covering more of the customer landscape sort of getting into more new logos, more geographies, more segments and also developing our products and getting those products adopted by more of these customers, which is how we're going to have accelerating growth in the future. Well, so we have a lot of products that are early in their life cycle. Some of them are large categories where we are seeing larger and larger revenue and we have very ambitious plans, such as security. Some others are newer but might be a bit more topical in 2023, such as Cloud Cost Management.  So, I think it's really going to be a mix. We see some interesting early signs of Cloud Cost Management, which is still only billed to a handful of customers at this point but already seeing very large commitments from some of these customers. We called that out on the call.  So, we think it might be -- if you think of anything that might have more of an impact in the short-term term that might be one of those. But really, the way we think about all those products is how do we turn them all into major products two, three, four years out, how do we win these additional categories, and how do we become the platform of choice for consolidation in the long term? That's what we're driving towards. Well, it's a bit difficult to compare to infra because it was the very first thing we did in the company. We -- it's actually pretty comparable to what we've seen with APM, where it's a domain with a lot of investment required. We also have a very ambitious and very differentiated approach to it, which requires quite a bit of a build-out and quite a few things to figure out with customers. But we're also seeing continuous adoption and growth, thousands of customers using the platform.  We see it being adopted at a very large scale by very large customers, which -- some of which we also mentioned on the call today. So, we're not completely there yet. There's still a lot of work to do, but we think it's tracking well to -- with respect to what we can expect in our plan. Well, it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the future, right? So, we don't really have a crystal ball there. What we see, though, is that customers save money where it matters, which tends to be the very large line items, which for customers that are fairly far along into the cloud, is going to be, first, their cloud provider deals that are, again, one or two others are larger than their observability bills.  And then we're going to be affected by that and maybe with some optimization more specific to observability as well. So that's what we see there. That's why we see most of the large customers do that. On the smaller side, I'll point out that many of our smaller customers are actually very large companies that just are fairly new into the cloud and are still growing to the cloud. So, they are seeing exactly the same thing as their peers who are spending a lot more on us. It's just the part of their business that is where the spend is growing as opposed to where the spend is today and needs to be controlled.  The last thing I will say is on the very low end of our customer base, we do see impact of the macro environment. We have a little bit more churn at the very, very low end, which is what you see our customer count not going up as much despite us having very strong notable quarters. That's more focused at the very, very low end of the customer base, and it's not moving the numbers at all in terms of gross retention, which remains very high. Well, we work with the large customers, obviously, to make sure that they get what they need. We're optimizing gross margin, obviously, we're doing quite a bit on our end to -- on the engineering side to do that. At all levels, 1% of gross margin is making a very large difference for their business, and we can reinvest that in future growth. Changing prices by 1% based on that doesn't make a big difference for customers.  I think when they -- the real way to address their concerns as they keep scaling and generating much more data and sending more observability data to us is to give them more options to process that data so that they can align with what they pay to us with the value they get. And we've been also building that on the product side. So, it's not really a pricing question. It's more of a product and structure question. And I just wonder now that we're on cost, I just want to add a little clarification. I think we talked about the trends of gross margin and what we expect for the future. And we gave some guidance as to operating expenses in 2023. I believe I might have misspoken. The operating expense guidance in 2023 in the low 30s range excludes COGS. We gave the COGS guide separately as far as our comments on that, just to clarify. To be clear, our guidance doesn't assume that the optimization stops. What we've seen over the past few quarters, basically in the second half of 2022, we assume it's going to continue. We know it's going to end at some point but we don't know when exactly, so we're not building that into our guidance. In the end, the reason for that is we still have ground to cover. We still have segment and geographies to cover. And also, as we mentioned earlier, we're having actually great success when it comes to landing new logos and new products with customers. So, our sales interactions are productive.  Our return on investment is there. So, we need to keep doing that. Again, these are the seeds of future success we are planting, and we don't intend to stop. No. I mean, we see a fairly -- like when you think of the products that are a major scale today, which are APM, logs and infrastructure monitoring, those are seeing about the same trend in terms of growth in Q4. And I think that's partly because some of the optimization we see from customers happens across this -- because it happens upstream from us at the provider level.  And that's why we'll see slightly slower growth of host monitored on the cap providers or APM and also a little bit less log. Some of it happens more directly at the observability level, logs in particular or some aspects of APM that are transaction-based where we see customers optimizing there and making sure they get the best value and cut the noise.  But as a result, we see fairly similar trends across the products. So that's why we didn't call out anything specific in there. We -- in the future, I'm sure we'll share more about their relative sizes. But again, the growth rates are not that different in Q4. So, it's -- there was nothing to call out. No. We say it's mostly because they can save money on their cloud bills. The -- again, one of the great things about the cloud is that the -- it's an ongoing expense. You can adjust it over time, you can restructure the way you're running applications. So, there are some norms you can use to optimize, which you can't if you're running everything on-prem, as all the costs are sunk already and confined to the future.  So, we mostly see that -- I mean, there's a little bit more noise than -- and predictability with some customers because they're having checkups, and so you need to talk to different people and they need to reorganize a little bit. So, it can add a little bit of noise on the conversations. But really, the dominant motion is the optimizing their cloud infrastructure, their cloud bill and their -- that's especially the case if they're spending a lot there.  The vast majority of our products are infrastructure usage or data volumes not per seat. So, we're not directly impacted by layoffs. Yes. Our customers are definitely interested in FinOps, the larger they are, the more they are interested, and that directly relates to the work they do in cloud optimization. It's a very nascent category today. It's a nascent practice for most of our customers. And we also have a lot of experience internally running ourselves a very large cloud operation across all of the large cost cloud providers.  So that's why we believe we can build something that is fairly differentiated there. Our product there is having a great reception from customers, even though it's still early. I mentioned earlier, we signed a six-year deal, annual deal with a large restaurant chain. And we see more of that coming our way. So, we think it's one way in which we can also help our customers as they need to optimize and be more efficient in the short and midterm. Mathematically, we -- the Q4 was more front loaded than back loaded in terms of whole recognized revenue. So, we entered at a lower level than -- so that's why we also have the sequential is a little bit lower there. In terms of the trends, I'll just second what David said, we -- when that seasonality was higher than we had seen in previous years, and we can explain that in different ways.  And basically, if customers are trying to save money, they're a lot more careful about turning off the lights when they leave for vacation basically. But what we see in early 2023 so far is consistent with what we see in in Q4 or in the second half of 2022 in general. So, it's too early really to pass judgment, but it really factors into our guidance, which is that we don't believe that the optimization has stopped. We assume it's going to continue. We don't know yet when going to stop. We know it's going to happen at some point, but we're not planning it for this year in our guidance. So, I mean, I can't give you specific numbers there. I know we're seeing wins low seeing engagements from the government agencies and the committees that serve them. So, all that is very good. We still have some building to do on the go-to-market teams for that.  And we also still have some things to build on the product side. Like there's more levels of certification we want to get to reach more of those customers. So, we still What I'd say is we're getting the proof points that we're fit and that customers can use us in those environments and that there is a real market for us there. Yes. So, it's a little bit hard to give an answer that fits all types of customers because they're also all going to -- they organize a little bit differently. There are different scales in there and they're going through different phases with their businesses in the economy. We've seen customers having multiple rounds of layoffs, for example, or having to adjust multiple times what they're doing with their business.  But what we see in general is that the fastest thing they can do to have an impact on the abilities to adjust some of the data they send in logs or in APM. And after that, you'll see them do a little bit more at the cloud provider level, which is higher impact in terms of their own savings, but also takes a little bit more time because we need to reorganize some of their workloads and invest more engineering time in doing that.  So, we've seen that happen with some of our customers. For a number of our customers, we saw it happen. We think they've done, and that's -- and we see them start growing again. But it's too early to call it for the rest of the customer base as again, they're all going through a fairly different things and different scale. So right now, in the guidance, we're assuming that we're seeing the same trends of growth of rising customer throughout the year. Like we're not estimating any inflection. We're assuming a continuation of that with some level of contribution compared to the actual we saw last year. That's what we are building in.  The -- again, we believe that there's going to be some reacceleration at some point as the optimization has on its course. But given the level of macro uncertainty, I think it's too difficult to -- we can't actually tell you when. Again, we've listened to the call of the cloud providers, they also can't tell you when. And so, we're being prudent with the guidance there. Thank you all. So, I just want to take a minute to first thank our customers for trusting us with their business and partnering with us. I know some of them are going through difficult times last year and also early this year. And so, we're working with them. Potentially we all come out of it stronger. I also want to thank our employees, Datadogs everywhere around the world, for actually delivering a fantastic year in 2022, from all of the metrics we control ourselves.  We saw some slowdown in consumption with some customers, but we also delivered a lot of value for customers. We scaled our go-to-market teams. We did great in terms of landing new logos, attaching new products, shape new products that solve more problems for our customers. And we think that this bodes very well for the future. So, I'm very optimistic. I'm looking forward to a fantastic year in 2023 with everyone. And on this, I'll close the call."

            "name": "David Obstler",
            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. In Q4, we continued to execute well and delivered value to our customers. Revenue was $469 million, up 44% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of our Q4 performance, first, we saw existing customer usage growth in October and November at a similar level to what we saw in Q2 and Q3.  In the month of December, we saw a slower growth dynamic as the typical slowdown we see at the end of December was more pronounced than in previous years. As a result, the growth rate in usage by existing customers was lower in Q4 than in Q2 and Q3.  Next, similar to Q2 and Q3, we saw larger-spending customers grow slower than smaller spending customers. As with Q2 and Q3, we saw relatively more deceleration in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food delivery. Geographically, we saw solid and relatively similar growth across all regions.  As Olivier discussed, we experienced strong new logo ARR growth and low churn again in this quarter. We had a record level of new logo bookings in the quarter across customer sizes. Our dollar net base net retention remained at strong levels, above 130% for the 22nd consecutive quarter. And gross revenue retention has remained unchanged over the last several quarters and remained steady in the mid-to high 90s. We believe this high and steady gross retention points to the mission-critical nature of the Datadog platform for our customers. Now moving on to our financial results. Billings in the quarter were $536 million, up 31% year-over-year. Billings duration was slightly lower year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.06 billion, up 30% year-over-year. And RPO duration declined on a year-over-year basis, and we note that current RPO growth was in the high 30s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $378 million, representing a gross margin of 81%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and also 80% in the year ago quarter.  We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs, reflected in our cost of goods sold in this quarter. In the mid- to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range. Our Q4 non-GAAP OpEx grew 54% year-over-year as we continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market. Q4 operating income was $83 million or an 18% operating margin compared to an operating income of $71 million or a 22% operating margin in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, the year ago operating margin benefited from lack of in-person office, travel and event costs due to our COVID policies during the pandemic. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $114 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $96 million for a free cash flow margin of 21%. Now for our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers compared to historical periods. And as usual, we are basing our near-term guidance on recent activity we see with our customers. We are incorporating an expectation for seasonally weaker growth in the first quarter due to the subdued growth in the month of December that creates a lower growth trajectory to start the first quarter. While our customers are continuing to expand with us, we are assuming in our guidance that cloud optimization continues to affect our expansion rate in 2023. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $466 million to $470 million, which represents a 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $68 million to $72 million or an operating margin of 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.07 billion to $2.09 billion, which represents a 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million for a margin of 15% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.09 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now some additional notes on the guidance. First, regarding our fiscal year 2023 investments, we continue to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large long-term opportunities. Our non-GAAP operating income guidance reflects this discipline. We will continue to grow our R&D and go-to-market teams as we broaden our platform in service of our customer needs, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.  As a result, we are planning to grow our operating expenses, including COGS, in the fiscal year 2023 in the low 30s percent range year-over-year. We plan to grow our headcount in fiscal year 2023 in the mid-20s percent range year-over-year. This compares to fiscal 2022 headcount growth of approximately 50% year-over-year. Next, as interest rates have risen, our interest income has increased and become more meaningful. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $75 million. We expect tax expense in fiscal year 2023 to be $11 million to $13 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the range of 4% to 5% of revenues in fiscal year 2023.  To reiterate Olivier's comments, we see no change to our long-term opportunities as our customers embark and expand on their cloud migration and digital transformation plans. We remain strongly positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with these journeys.  I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in 2022, and I'm excited about our plans for the next year.  With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. And I just want to add that because we tend, as you know, to go land and expand and our customers tend to undercommit relative to what they eventually get to, we haven't seen across the customer base, a very meaningful increase of sort of unused commitments. And so that's something about our go-to-market that creates flexibility with clients to commit as they see usage. Yes. I think -- again, I think it is really driven by the ARR and linearity of that. So, I don't think we plan for billings, et cetera. We essentially have had billings, as you know, go above and below the revenue based on the billings in that period. And so, we don't see really any change in that type of pattern. But again, bring everyone back to ARR and revenues as the major economic driver. Yes. I think we've continued to use the same approach, which is to look at the history and discount the major assumptions, which are the organic growth or the expansion of existing customers and new logos. I think the difference in the actual results were the periods of times where we saw more than pro rata or more than historical adoption and growth of existing customers, the ratio between that discount and where it ends is up actuals ended up larger. But the intent and the strategy of providing this guidance on conservative assumptions relative to that has not changed. Yes, yes. I think that's right. We are growing our investments in go-to-market and sales capacity approximately plus or minus at the guidance we gave in headcount growth. I would clarify that because of the ramping nature of salespeople, the growth rate that we had, which was in excess of that 25% in 2022 means that the coming online of that ramp capacity is at a rate higher than that in 2023 as we begin to harvest the investment from that. Yes. I think you're right. Implicit in that guide is below 130%. We'll report to everybody as we have that. We've seen it relate to a decel, I would say, on that, that given the change in the organic growth rate that we've been talking about starting in the middle of Q2 last year, it would be -- it's getting past that to the extent that it changes -- that changes that net retention plus or minus, given the net retention is comparison against the year-on-year customers.  So, you do have headwinds in the compare through the time that we had the change of the organic, which we had said was in the middle of Q2 of last year. Yes. I think you have two different avenues. I think we said in new logos, we have a strong quarter. We continue, as we mentioned, to have a strong pipeline, meaning that for new projects, new workloads, we continue to see a solid demand environment. In terms of the organic, when you have -- and this happens in most years, when you have people going on vacation and sort of reducing the amount of logs or work they're doing, you tend to see a rebound of that in January.  We did see a bit of that. But given the volatility in the market, we want to be cautious in reading too much into that. And we'll let everybody know how that plays out. We've always said that our free cash flow has been around slightly higher than our EBIT margin. If you look back, you'll see that it's, in some quarters, a little above, in some quarters a little below. We have not seen any changes of -- any material changes in payment terms or the flows of cash. So, there's nothing we've seen so far that would cause us to change our views about cash flow conversion for the company."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report strong results in Q3 as we continued to execute on our platform vision. Let me start with a review of our financial performance. In Q3, revenue was $437 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 22,200 customers, up from about 17,500 in the year-ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,600 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 1,800 in the year-ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. We generated free cash flow of $67 million, with a free cash flow margin of 15%. And our dollar-based net retention rates continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted more products. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q3, 80% of customers were using two or more products, up from 77% a year ago; 40% of customers were using four or more products, up from 31% a year-ago; and 16% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 8% a year ago. We continued to be pleased with this continued adoption of multiple products in our platform, which indicates the additional value we are bringing to our customers. We continue to see strong ARR growth with our newer offerings and our products introduced since 2019, which excludes infrastructure monitoring, core ATM and wealth management remain in hyper growth mode. I also want to highlight a couple of our newer products, Database Monitoring and CI Visibility. We started charging for these products three and two quarters ago, respectively, and each has already exceeded 8 figure in ARR and more than 1,000 customers. And as we are further developing them, we are confident these products will lead to a broader set of use cases for a larger set of customers over time. Now moving on to this core business drivers. At a high level, Q3 was overall very similar to Q2 with strong performance in new logos and new product attach activities tempered by growth of user from existing customers that further healthy was below our long-term historical average. This added up to sequential net ARR added that was similar to Q2. To give you a bit more color, first, on the usage trend. As we said, user growth was overall solid, but consistent with Q2 trends. From a product perspective, [indiscernible] was more homogeneous among our major products than it had been in Q2. Looking at industry verticals, similar to last quarter, we continue to see a more pronounced effect in consumer discretionary and in particular with our customers that are cognitive and fully scaled into public cloud. Note that the consumer discretionary vertical represents low-teens percent of our ARR and includes e-commerce, as well as food and delivery. All that said, we are pleased with our Q3 strong performance. Revenue in Q3 grew 61% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter, with all of our products meaningfully outperforming the growth of the large cloud providers. While the macroeconomic environment is likely to remain a headwind in the near-term, we continue to see positive trends underpinning our business and remain bullish about the long-term opportunities and aggressive with our investment plan. First, we continue to see strong growth in new logo ARR, including some large wins in traditional industries. We'll talk about some of those in a bit.  Second, our sales pipeline is strong heading into Q4 for both new logos and new products. And we're seeing great opportunities across customer sizes, geography and industry. Alongside our strength in new logo ARR, which gives us confidence that visual transformation and cloud migration remain a top priority. It\u2019s perhaps even more critical in difficult times when businesses need to be more agile and do more with less. Remember that given our usage specifi models, new logos wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue, but they are very important to us as new customers expand their usage in subsequent new quarters and subsequent years. Third, we are seeing continued expansion on our platform as indicated by customers adopting more of our products. And finally, churn remains low and hasn't changed with gross revenue retention steady in the mid to high-90s. We believe this high-gross revenue retention is indicative of the business criticality to have Datadog for our customers. Now let's move on to product and R&D. Few weeks ago, we had our Dash user conference, which was an occasion to showcase the expansion of our products and the results of our R&D investments. Let me go through some of these starting with visibility [ph] before moving on to security, developer experience; and finally, the ability to take action within Datadog. First, we are doubling down on our investments in the visibility, starting with two new products, Data Stream Monitoring and Cloud Cost Management, both addressing growing needs and strong demand from our customers. We also extended our APM fleet to offer mobile app testing, user heat maps and Dominic instrumentation. On the network side, we added 70 traps and metro monitoring to our products. On the lodging side, we announced [indiscernible] which coupled with live archives and the visibility pipeline that is at the center of our customers better management. Responding to customer demand. We also expanded our sensitive data scanner beyond logs to identify sensitive data across APM and RAM. And across the platform, we've announced expanded support for open telemetry, PCI compliance for APM and Log, as well as EPA compliance across most of Datadog. Second, we are extending our security platform, and we announced cloud security management, which brings together cloud workload security, cloud security posture management and resource catalog as a frictionless reach and context aware, cloud native application protection platform or CNAP. We launched massive protection for application security management to enable blocking attacks in real time directly within Datadog platform and we now provide venerability monitoring to give our users a high-fidelity picture of all applications production as well as the dependencies, renewability and the attack rate base. Third, we follow through with our recent entry in developer experience. We announced continuous testing to facilitate end-to-end testing as soon as the coding develop, which increases quality and velocity at the same time. And we showcase intelligent test runner using our rich APM and propylene data to automatically keep united tests and drastically reduce time and money spent on CICD. Fourth and last but not least, we announced new product areas that take our platform for observing to allowing our users with action and response all within Datadog. We announced our asset management products to allow our users to correlate and summarize alerts, events and issues, movies associates in order to resolve problems directly from the Datadog area of concern. We also announced Datadog workflows, which allows customers to develop and run ultimately DevOps or security remediation using no code editor and already more than 200 integrations to service they use. We announced lease availability for hosting the collaboration meeting tool that we acquired last year, RUM's real-time screen sharing installation point in Datadog. And finally, we kept on expanding the scope of our watchdog AIM energy. Further automating the detection and guiding the resolution of application in the cost problems. As for dominance from NASH. And as you can tell, the team has been hard at work, and I'm extremely proud of our innovation velocity and focus on our customers. And lastly on products. As we announced in the press release issued this morning, we acquired Cloud Craft, a planning design tool used by tens of thousands of cloud optics to create [indiscernible] , including real-time health, configuration and cost data and we are very excited for their team to bring to Datadog. Now moving on to sales and marketing. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q2. First, we signed a 7-figure land with approaching 100 grocery chain. This company was mitigating to Azure, but was held back by their open source solution. And because this grocery chain has fanatic better controls around personally investing fair information. Our extensive data center and our HIPPA compliance filled that gap amd were differentiators for Datadog giving this opportunity. Next \u2013 we signed a 7-figure land with a major multinational restaurant chain, this company had a legacy availability solution that wasn't able to scale with their vision of subunits and severe environment. They also needed an end-to-end view of their customer journey, and we will now use their paradox products, including Synthetics and RUM to drive customer experience improvement. Next, we signed a 7-figure land with a social networking app. This company was previously a Datadog customer but had moved several years ago to a competitor as maybe certain languages where APM product is going to go well at the time. Today, our APM not only magical abilities of the solution, but presented significant advantages in terms of either deployment, alerting and [indiscernible] detection. And we also plan to take advantage of our new service catalog, taking Datadog at the center of the operation. Next, we had a seven-figure up-sell with a large Asia-based technology conglomerate. This company is many business units include consumer electronics and IoT. And the use of Datadog has grown rapidly with the number of devices we are managing. We had a number of benefits from using Datadog including lowering the amount of buckets by 25% and a high time to resolution by 50%. We have also seen a significant sensing in incident response activity by encode engineers from 20 hours, 22 hours per week. With this new, this customer has now adopted 14 Datadog products. Next, we had an eight-figure multiyear upsell with a large e-commerce company. This customer had been using primarily infrastructure monitoring and APM with Datadog and he was also operating an open source of input. Using Datadog led to significant efficiency including certain customer impacting incidents by close to two-thirds and reducing the number of employees required to address each incident by one-third. With this renewal, they are adopting Datadog Log Management and ROM and consolidating multiple home growth and cloud-mated tools as well as a commercial competitor. That's it for this quarter's customer highlights, and I'd like to thank our go-to-market team for the award and for delivering another strong quarter. Now let me speak to our longer-term outlook. We recognize the macro environment remains uncertain. We continue to see no change to the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. And we remain confident that we can help our customers with their efforts to sell on costs, drive credit engineering efficiency and take advantage of the benefits of cloud and other next-gen technologies. So we are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to capture our long-term opportunity. We remain laser focused on bringing value to our customers as we manage through more challenging economic environment. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. In Q3, we continued to execute well and support our customers. Revenue was $437 million, up 61% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers. First, we experienced strong new logo ARR growth and continued low churn again this quarter. We saw existing customer usage growth remain at levels similar to Q2 as customers continue to be more cost-conscious as they manage their businesses. As Olivier noted, we saw a roughly similar sequential growth in ARR dollars added in Q2 as -- in Q3 as in Q2. And we saw a relatively homogenous usage growth amongst our major products during Q3. As with Q2, we saw relatively more deceleration in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food and delivery. And we saw similar growth across geographies. As a reminder, we bill all of our revenue in US dollars, and we do not price in local currencies. Our dollar-based net retention remained at strong levels above 130% for the 20th consecutive -- 21st consecutive quarter. Our land and expand model, aggressive product innovation and our customers' motion to the cloud continue to drive expansion opportunities with our existing customer base. Overall, the customer usage growth we're seeing remains higher than the trough growth we experienced at the beginning of COVID in 2020, and we're pleased with our 61% year-over-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth this quarter. Meanwhile, gross revenue retention was unchanged and steady in the mid to high 90s. Regardless of the macroeconomic environment, our customers still need to serve their clients and moving to the cloud enables better service and cost savings against people intensive or on-prem technology based offerings. We believe our high and steady gross retention indicates that Datadog is critical to our customer\u2019s ability to deliver services to their clients digitally. And as Oli mentioned, on new logos, we saw continued strong new logo ARR growth across geographies, industries and company sizes, and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities in Q4. Finally, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 80% of our customers using two or more products, 40% using four or more products and 16% using six or more products as of the end of Q3. Moving on to our financial statements, billings were $467 million, up 51% year-over-year. Billings duration was slightly lower year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO was $941 million, up 31% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the mid-40s year-over-year. As a reminder, we signed several large multiyear renewals in Q3 2021, which may make current RPO, a more useful indicator with -- as it excludes the multiyear duration impact. We also had a challenging comparables of that metric as Q3 of last year, current RPO growth was about 100%. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoices and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $348 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 81% last quarter and 78% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the medium to long-term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range. Our Q3 non-GAAP OpEx grew 65% year-over-year as we continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market. Q3 operating income was $75 million or a 17% operating margin compared to an operating income of $44 million or a 16% operating margin in the year ago quarter. Then turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $84 million in the quarter after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $67 million for a free cash flow margin of 15%.  Now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022. First, informing our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers. And as usual, we are basing our guidance on current economic conditions, which includes slower than historical growth in usage among existing customers as we have seen in Q2 and Q3.  For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $445 million to $449 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $56 million to $60 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.18 to $0.20 per share range based on an approximate 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  For fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.654 billion, which represents 61% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. And non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $304 million with non-GAAP net income per share expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.92 per share, again, based on an approximate 346 million weighted average annual diluted shares.  Now some notes on guidance. As we discussed last quarter, Q4 includes some large input person events, including our Dash user conference, which was held 2 weeks ago, and AWS Reinvent, our largest trade show event of the year. The cost of those events will result in an approximate 300 to 400 basis points effect on margins. As it relates to our capital expenditures, we are adding more office space around the world as we continue to return to office. We expect CapEx of about $15 million in Q4.  In conclusion, while we recognize macroeconomic uncertainty continued into Q3, we see no change in the importance of cloud migration and digital transformation, which are critical to our customers' competitive advantage. We believe we are well positioned to help our customers embark on these journeys and we are investing aggressively into our long-term opportunities while maintaining our financial stress. I want to thank Datadog\u2019s worldwide for their participation in these efforts. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo, your line is live.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats on a great Q3. Olivier, like a quick question for me. The first one is on, if you compare the current situation and the current environment and what you saw in the pandemic. Back then, the hyperscalers kind of talked about cost optimization and customers calling back a little bit. It does seem it's slightly different now. Could you maybe talk a bit about some of the factors that you're seeing out there? And then I have 1 follow-up for David.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, the situation is fairly different now from what we saw in COVID. First of all, [indiscernible] very good, very broad, everyone was planning to serve money as quickly as possible, which is not what we\u2019re seeing today. What we're seeing today is few of things actually. First of all, everything that is related to direct transactions with customers, whether it's new logos or new products, all of that is actually working great, but the demand we can see there is as strong as we've seen it. When you look at the usage and where you might see cost optimization, I think there are two different stories there. There's these customers that are largely cloud native and normally pretty scale in the tough environment, so then have cloud end-to-end on public cloud that are definitely planning to save money. And these are companies that, in general, also tend to have their own growth rates affected or probably affected in the future by the macro trends. So that's why they're doing that. But when you look at the other customers, the ones that are earlier in their cloud migration, they are actually not slowing down, and we see the same urgency and eagerness for them to keep scaling and keep moving into the cloud. And that's also where the bulk of our opportunities. When you compare us to the hyperscalers, the -- we are seeing some expenses they see when -- and by the way, I should say, it's always hard to do -- to draw a direct comparison between the numbers of hyperscalers and ours. Their numbers include a bunch of a lot of things beyond infrastructure. And we're also not just in public cloud, but also might quite a bit of a private environment as well. But we're seeing some of what they're seeing in terms of optimization. We're a little bit less sensitive to it because we tend to -- because of what we do, we tend to skew towards more critical environment than everything that might in the hyperscaler. And overall, all of our products meaningfully outperformed the growth of the hyperscalers.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then David, in these kind of uncertain times, a lot of the time you have negotiations or a vendor has negotiated with customers around billing, billings terms, et cetera. Have you seen anything that is impacting you or that you can note? Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: No, we really haven't seen any difference in billing terms or DSOs for that matter. So on that side, given the mission-critical nature of the product, we haven't seen any material changes in that.\nOlivier Pomel: And again, that is different from COVID. In that, COVID was really a cash crunch that was a little bit we were worried about. And so they are trying to prevent money from going out of the door right way. Like in this case is more preparing for an environment where they might want to watch a profitability a bit more. And customers, when they negotiate on these difficult ones that are fully scaled, the one thing they look for is more cautionary in terms of how long they can be for and how much it can follow period of time when they're -- especially when they be unsure of their own growth rates.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Congrats.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Fred Lee with Credit Suisse. Fred, your line is now open.\nFred Lee: Hey, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on your traction in security. What segments you're seeing the most traction? And also bigger picture, what you're seeing in the wake of the silos breaking down between second DevOps overall?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So bigger picture we -- I mean, fairly well, everybody is talking about it. I could imagine they are the only ones speak about, they need to bring security to get an app, and have given up their -- a lot of responsibility in that. So -- and we're confident that this is -- we see that developing in a way that's very similar to what we see with DevOp about a decade ago. So this gives us that confidence. In terms of our traction, we're happy with where we are. We see -- we have -- we mentioned earlier, thousands of customers [indiscernible] the products, the customer business is growing fast, the revenue is growing fast, but it's not like growth for grow in the end, typically, as this product is very fast. And what we see is a lot of market pull of attraction with. There's a lot of customers who want us to be there, and there's a lot of product investments we\u2019ve seen here today. Some of that in a Dash and there's a lot more coming. So it's working as planned that we'd say at this point.\nFred Lee: Thank you. Great quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark, your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much, and I will add my congratulations on a nice performance. So Olivier, many customers had said that your Cloud Cost Management Solution is extremely well timed. And they're saying that because they're seeing interest in cost optimizations that didn't exist about six months ago. I'm wondering if that aligns with your view, and does that feel like a product to you that can get off to a pretty fast start in this environment? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nOlivier Pomel: I mean, you're right that cost management is on a lot of people's minds right now. But I would say that it was a really big case six months ago and even a year ago. I think any company that is fully scaled into the cloud cares about their efficiency and they seem that have quite a bit of leverage in terms of cost improvement if they get it the right way with the right tool. So we think it's a product that, yes, it's well timed, but we think it's a product that's going to be -- that has the potential of being very adaptive and very useful for a very long time even after we come out of this challenging macro environment.\nMark Murphy: Okay, understood. And then, David, just as a quick follow-up. Looking at the sequential growth in Q3 is around 7%, and the way it appears in guidance for Q4, just thinking about your cadence, that would seem to compound out at a year-over-year growth rate around 30%, thinking forward. Is that type of cadence a fairway to try to conceptualize the glide path into next year, just figuring somewhere around 30% if we want to derisk the models? Or do you think that Q3 and Q4 are maybe not so representative of where the puck is going to be heading here?\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. As a reminder, we provide guidance in a consistent way. We essentially look at the environment, the performance and given the usage model, we put conservative assumptions on top of that. We employed that for the guidance we gave here in Q4. For next year, we'll provide guidance when we report Q4 and plan to update everybody at that time.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Keep in mind that different aspects that the -- part of it is driven by the new logos where we're getting from customers. Part of it is driven by the growth of existing customers. And the one we actually get also is -- it's tougher to grow customers very fast when they're growing with us a lot over the past few years when customers have grown in the 80% year-over-year, 30% year-over-year through all these years, they may go away before after that. But in turn, it might give us an easier compare for the future.\nMark Murphy: Thank you, Olivier.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Sanjit, your line is now open.\nYuka Broderick: Sanjit, we can't hear you. Can you please get near to your mic?\nSanjit Singh: Sorry about that. Appreciate guys taking the question. My question is really around competitive displacements and potentially observability consolidation within your customer base? To what extent are you seeing customers either consolidate open source or other commercial tools and standardize on Datadog, not just to benefit from the innovation that you're seeing from the Datadog's platform, but also to lower their overall observability monitoring spend as they go into next year?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, we do see a little bit of both. I think it's interesting what we've seen in the past. There's no other new trend there, but we see that happening across our customers. We think also in the future, this is going to only become more compelling when customers also bring to us more of their security use cases, more of their user analytics use cases. So these so far have required different copies of the data to different to different vendors, and this tends to be the most expensive part of the other one, the part of the cost structure that scales in the [indiscernible] vendors. So we think we make a very compelling long-term proposition with these customers.\nSanjit Singh: That makes a lot of sense. And then I think, Olivier, in your script, you called out a customer that's using 14 different products, which is pretty incredible to think about. For customers that's adopting that many different product capabilities, how is that contract structured? And how does that adoption happen? Is it through some broader, flexible credit system, or are they being -- are these products being sold or priced individually? Can you just give us a sense for a customer that gets up to that level of adoption, how does the contracting work for that type of customer?\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. So the majority of those contracts for large customer view of products are made on what we call the drawdown, which is basically setting committed amount of credit that customers can use. In relation to that, they get a red card for all the values queue [ph] that are going to consume. And those red clients can also be negotiated. Some customers use very large amounts of certain products, they can get a better rate of those specific products as well as to negotiate that. I think that's where it gets a little bit taller to that specific use cases in the business.\nDavid Obstler: And not to add, that's what we've been talking about the frictionless adoption where the client is using the platform. And given this drawdown with a rate card, they can use the products in a frictionless way as they expand their use of the Datadog platform.\nOlivier Pomel: The benefit for them is just -- they usually don't know how much of each of the products they are going to consume ahead of time. But overall, with the shape up there or the size of the environment is going to be, but also don't know within this environment how much APM traces that would need versus logs versus metric versus really use our monitoring, is there anything else that we produce. So it gives them the flexibility there. And again, that's another reason to bring in more tooling of platform because they don't have to pre-commit everything in separate buckets basically.\nSanjit Singh: Best of luck, and thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with BofA Securities. Koji, your line is open.\nKoji Ikeda: Hey, Olivier. Hey, David. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig in here on the consumer discretionary, and I appreciate all the comments you had in the prepared remarks. But was really wondering how much of that vertical is international? Just thinking about FX and the potential effects of FX there if the USD strength persists in the future? Thanks guys.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So on FX, sorry, David, if I'm stealing your thoughts out. The -- we charge in dollars everywhere. So we don't have any formal FX risk. We don't provide any adjusted numbers for FX, any of that. We do, however, our customers buy our products from Europe and from Japan, their budgets are still in Japanese yen or in euros. And so we do think that the strong dollar is a headwind for us. We don't see very dramatically different growth rates between Europe, Americas and APAC. So we think we might see higher growth in APAC and Europe, which are smaller parts of our revenues and less mature if the dollar was weaker. It is conjecture. We can't actually quantify that because we're charging dollars everywhere, but that's something that we are aware of.\nDavid Obstler: But in that -- just to add, in that sector, we commented on the predominant effect would be what's happening in their business, in their sector rather than geographical location of the company and its customers.\nKoji Ikeda: Got it. Great guys. Thanks so much for that.. And just one follow-up, if I may, here on the Cloudcraft acquisition. Just any color on how big this company is? The press release, it says, hundreds of thousands of engineers. So how does that equate to maybe customer overlap? And does Cloudcraft open the door to maybe new personas to sell into within organizations? Thanks so much guys for taking my questions.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So Cloudcraft is very interesting, because it's a very great product. There are lots of opportunities in terms of integrating product with ours. There are opportunities also with some part of this product many stand-alone. It's a product that works very well for planning and for cloud architects in general to start their planning their document in cloud migration. It's also interesting for us from a distribution perspective because it has a lot of different users today, it has a very broad reach. It's also very easy to embed on third-party sites. So there are a number of opportunities we're excited about with Cloudcraft. You'll see more as we integrate and as we pursue these opportunities. But we're very excited with the opportunity that we have been tracking for a while.\nDavid Obstler: Just to make sure it's clear, it's a small company. It's an acqui-hire like we've done, meaning we are bringing on board the engineers, it does come with a customer base. It's an immaterial amount of revenues relative to our total. And as Oli mentioned, provides an extension of the platform, as well as potentially some leads and some lead generation in the customers and personas.\nKoji Ikeda: Thanks Oli. Thanks David. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks guys. David, for you. Last quarter, you talked about a stronger July versus June. I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit on how the linearity of the quarter played out, and then maybe also how is -- how did October trend relative to September?\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. So we -- for linearity, it was very similar linearity to what we've had. There was no difference. And so we saw -- unlike last quarter a bit, we saw pretty much of a pro rata type of quarter. And we normally have a strong October in terms of the flow of our customers and what they're doing in the platform before pro freezes. We're pleased with what we have seen so far, but still recognize that October is usually strong for us. And it's only the beginning of the quarter. Oli, anything else you want to add that?\nOlivier Pomel: No, I think the one thing you're trying to get through the over time during the quarter, we exited the quarter pretty much at where we entered it. There's no change there. And again, as David said, we're happy with what we see there, and we're also usually happy with our product. We -- Q4 has a bit more seasonality in other quarters, in particular, December tends to be a little bit weaker as a lot of our customers take time off and sit down their development environment and things in that. It's also been a little bit harder to forecast in recent years with the pandemic and the behavior that -- the vacation behavior that change after the pandemic. So we are little bit careful with that, and that's all incorporated in our guidance.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. And remind everybody what we said in the script was that the Q3 performance was very similar in its drivers to Q2. So that's further evidence of, as Oli said, that's the conditions that we ended Q2 will continue throughout the Q3.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent, your line is now open.\nBrent Thill: David, a question on investment philosophy. Going into the pandemic, you didn't really pull the throttle back. You had at 11% -- going into these times, are you thinking differently about your investment philosophy in this cycle? And can you talk about quota-carrying reps in terms of -- are you at -- on pace to hire what you thought at the beginning of the year, are you pulling back a little bit given some of the current macro jitters.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. I think as we remind everybody, we've always lived within our means and been limited more by our ability to integrate in a responsible way of quota-carrying reps or R&D for that matter into our company. And we really have not made changes. We had a prudent plan and continued as a reminder to everybody, we think there's a very long-term opportunity, and we're investing behind that. We are cognizant that there's more volatility in microeconomic conditions, and we're looking at everything, but we didn't get out over our skis up to begin with in our plan. So it allows us given our model and the way we run the company to continue that investment in a systematic way.\nOlivier Pomel: Just to restate that, we did make changes, we're investing from an R&D perspective, this was so early, there's so much we want to do, and we have great tractions on the products, and we keep investing there. From a go-to-market perspective, as I mentioned on the call, we actually have a very strong pipeline and the conversion with customers are going right in terms of new logos and new products. And so there is value in growing the CRC and there is short-term and long-term value there. So we keep doing that. And the last thing I'd say is we -- remember, I keep putting, but we bought only $30 [ph] million from inception to the new company public, we generated a lot more cash since then. We have efficiency that's one of the core parts of our culture. That's how we run the business, where we built it. And as for the model, we've built in terms of fiction-less expansion and other \u2013 some of our products. So we trust that we have the levers and the way we hope to use them to make sure we have the right profitability as well.\nBrent Thill: And just a quick follow-up on the CRP. I know David, you mentioned, stay focus on that. It is continuing to decelerate, I guess, is that just a function of the large comps? Are you seeing larger enterprise customers? You've seen a slower cadence of large deals come in. Can you give us your take on that?\nDavid Obstler: Yeah, I think we had -- the comps are very significant in this quarter. In Q3 of last year, and I think we said this at the time, we had some large multiyear deals. As a reminder, we don't try to target multiyear deal we had from the client side. So that's why the current probably is more over time correlated. It is also moves. So if you look at the average of this, it tends over the longer time to correlate with revenues, but there's a lot of noise in this number. So we steer everyone back to revenues and then the computation we've given everybody how to convert revenues into ARR.\nOlivier Pomel: One big change again -- one big driver for this is -- our early customers we knew because they try to get ahead of the growth and secure better economics. And in times of uncertainty like this one, customers tend to wait and see more. And sometimes, we have slightly work economics a little bit, but there have been many optionality. And so this is why those numbers moved quite a bit. And again, the best predictor of what's going to happen next year, the revenue ramp on which we are. Everything else is a little bit more historic.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Kamil with William Blair. Kamil, your line is open.\nKamil Mielczarek: Thank you and congrats on a strong quarter. It sounds like international demand has remained relatively unchanged from June. Was that consistent across regions? And what do you think is unique about Datadog that is major sales in Europe, more resilient than some of your peers?\nOlivier Pomel: I mean, look, we see them everywhere. We're growing our teams everywhere. We're going to see on the right relative basis faster in Europe and in APAC than we are in the US. We're also doing the teams in Latin America, which is doing very well for us. So we -- from where we see, we see them in everywhere. We see Europe and Asia are a little bit behind the Americas in terms of maturity of the cloud migration. But they are scaling and it's happening there, the same way it happened in the past. From a competitive perspective, the situation is about the same everywhere, and it hasn't changed in any notable way over the past year, I would say. So there's nothing shocked to say there.\nKamil Mielczarek: That's helpful. And if I could just follow-up. You called out some vendor displays in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe comment on how much of your new customer wins are coming from competitive displacements versus greenfield opportunities? And between the two, are you seeing any difference in the macro impact that are companies that are using competitors, maybe revisiting alternative solutions to optimize pricing, or is the mix shift predictable?\nOlivier Pomel: It's still a small minority of the deals. It tends to be the only one that are very large because our customers already had something. They already have a large footprint, and we need to migrate over. So these are deals that are large and the one, which is not a matter of the deal. The last matter [indiscernible] are small and grow from there. These are the ones we tend to mention because these are the ones that are most interesting to look at from day one, but this is still a low minority, but we do. We also don't particularly seek those deals. We train our sales team to land as many new logos and new products as possible. And it's better for them to do 10 smaller ones than one larger one. And those 10 smaller ones will each be as big as the one large one in the end. So that's instead of dollar we make for dollar sale activity we spend that's most productive.\nKamil Mielczarek: That's helpful. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Fatima, your line is now open.\nFatima Boolani: Hey good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Oli, I've got one for you and one for you, David. Oli, to your commentary on the usage moderation persisting in the consumer discretionary vertical. I know this is a hard question, but what are some of the signs or signals from that vertical that would lead you to suggest or lead you to conclude that maybe there's more moderation to come. And I'm thinking about this in the context of big tech in the realm of digital advertising and all of the larger companies just beyond and outside of the CDP Vertical. So just any signals or signs that would lead you to conclude one way or the other is the worst of the moderation on the platform expansion is behind us? And then a quick follow-up for David, please.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, I think the question is -- I mean, it's mostly what we see the most case in the customers that are fully in the cloud, fully scaled in the cloud. And there, basically, we should expect their cloud bank to grow at the same rate of their top line in the end. And so when their top line part is slowing down a bit, or what is certainly slowing a bit -- they try and slow the expenses as well, which is what we've seen. I think what we can tell you is whether the top line will slowdown and start narrow a little bit or it's getting compressed, I think it all depends on how big of an economic downturn we face, if any. We're not really the business of predicting that. But what we see is for much of those customers, we got a pretty good idea of where they stand because we see what their projected spend growth is when it relates to the relative growth of the business.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you. David, last quarter, you sort of mentioned to us that a lot of customers and prospects are thinking about reduced commitment levels out the gate. So I'm curious about how that's trending this quarter and what your expectations are with what you're seeing with new customers in terms of commitment levels out the gate. And within this quarter, how much of that austerity, if you will, around commitment levels? How much of that austerity contributed to maybe usage upside beyond the commitment levels this quarter, just given the strength in the quarter? Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Just to clarify, so that's not exactly correct what you said. So it is -- so essentially, most of our customers are essentially land and expand and then commit and then grow their usage over time. And that has been going on in the whole model of the company. What we said last time was -- this is not related to they're cutting their commitment. This is related to when there are an overt on demand whether they decide to do a new commitment or stay on demand longer and to be able to get greater visibility. The comment from last quarter was really more about billing and those metrics then about customer usage. We said that customer usage has been lower than historical trends, but not as low as it was in COVID. So that's another effect. And what we talked about last quarter was more about the billing effect. So we continue to say that customers are, as we talked about, cautious, but that really only has a marginal effect in the billing. And actually, when a client decides that and stays on demand, it has a positive effect on the revenue side in that micro decision.\nOlivier Pomel: And I'll just add one thing to your first question. In terms of -- some part of the question is how do we know things are going to get better or worse in the future? I remind you that we have a usage technology [ph] for revenue, and we don't have to wait until the mix renewal to give the new some customers on whether this is better or worse. But the news is good or bad, we get it early. And an example of that is that while the -- broadly in the world, we see Q3 being worse at a macro level than Q2. As far as our business is concerned, Q3 is very, very much in line with Q2 and whatever step function there was in terms of changing the growth rates, so some customers happened in Q2 already and didn't change in Q3. So we are fairly confident that whatever happens with CPC this year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer and Co. Ittai, your line is open.\nIttai Kidron: Thank you. Congrats guys, great quarter. David, I just want to have one question for you on the net dollar expansion rate, great to see it well above 130. But I was hoping if you could give a little bit more color on that, specifically directionally, did it go down quarter-over-quarter? And perhaps, is there a way for you to break down the mix of existing solution expansion in that mix versus new solution adoption. I'm just wondering maybe not in absolute terms, but perhaps on a relative basis how that mix has changed over the last two, three quarters?\nDavid Obstler: Sure. So we don't give more pointed net retention, but it is a fact that if the organic rate -- expanding rate of customers is lower than it was in previous periods, and we said that the rate is lower than it was at the peak but not as low as it was at the low and COVID in the middle that, that would indicate that net retention would be going down mathematically. But we don't give more information than that. As far as the -- and I think we said a little bit about this in the past, as far as the mix between expansion of existing solutions and new as clients adopt more of the solution in their land, which we said is happening. What happens again, mathematically is that the percentage of the net retention from existing products goes up despite the fact that, as we said, we have very strong adoption of additional products. But we also have very strong momentum in client landing with more products, which affects that number directionally, if that makes sense.\nIttai Kidron: That's helpful. And then maybe, Oli, for you, on the database monitoring. It seems like you're off for a good start there. Just from a persona standpoint, does this expand the personas that you're touching, I mean, do you need to be engaged more with this admins in order to sell this product or I'm just trying to think from a go-to-market standpoint, what is needed to keep driving progress here?\nOlivier Pomel: In terms of from a go-to-market perspective, it was similarly as the rest of what we deliver, it expands nicely on top of the rest of the platform. You're right though that we're reaching to some of the more specialized function around like DDAs and people like that. But we also have -- who are not trained as DDAs, solve the issues and role as DDA security there. So we run it, there's a little bit of a difference there. I think today, because of the better business we just reported today, it's not as pronounced as it might be in the future when we start supporting that this is like [Indiscernible], for example, where the position of the DDA is more formalized, I would say.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Michael, your line is live.\nMichael Turits: Hey, so two quick questions. I think you talked about the growth rates of a number of hosts monitored last quarter is an indication that you really weren't seeing any slowing in the underlying capacity of what needed to be monitoring. Is that growth rate still the same?\nOlivier Pomel: It's -- if you look at the growth by product this time, it's not only closer than it needs to be, there's some variations quarter-to-quarter, a lot is about the same in growth rate. APM is a little bit better and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s down, but there's nothing really meaningful there. I think some of the effects you might expect from what you have from the hyperscale, we see maybe some of that in the infrastructure, but it's not extremely pronounced. So that's why we can't comment on this.\nMichael Turits: Okay. And then David, just on the CapEx that you called out that was having to do with headquarters, $15 million extra, I believe you said in this quarter. So I know you're not giving guidance for next year, but is that a one-quarter phenomenon, a multiquarter phenomenon, how big an impact longer term on CapEx?\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. Just clarify that wasn't extra. That's just the total amount, not the delta between the quarters. We haven't provided that type of guidance. We are expanding and building out offices. And again, when we provide guidance for next year, we'll endeavor to provide some guidance that will help in the modeling. Thanks.\nMichael Turits: Okay. Great guys. Thank you very much.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Olivier Pomel for any further comments.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. Thank you all for listening. I also want to thank, obviously, all Datadogs around the world for working so hard this quarter and that we have been another great quarter. And I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business and joining us at Dash also for the great event. So thank you all, and we'll speak again in Q4.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report strong results in Q3 as we continued to execute on our platform vision. Let me start with a review of our financial performance. In Q3, revenue was $437 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 22,200 customers, up from about 17,500 in the year-ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,600 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 1,800 in the year-ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. We generated free cash flow of $67 million, with a free cash flow margin of 15%. And our dollar-based net retention rates continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted more products. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q3, 80% of customers were using two or more products, up from 77% a year ago; 40% of customers were using four or more products, up from 31% a year-ago; and 16% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 8% a year ago. We continued to be pleased with this continued adoption of multiple products in our platform, which indicates the additional value we are bringing to our customers. We continue to see strong ARR growth with our newer offerings and our products introduced since 2019, which excludes infrastructure monitoring, core ATM and wealth management remain in hyper growth mode. I also want to highlight a couple of our newer products, Database Monitoring and CI Visibility. We started charging for these products three and two quarters ago, respectively, and each has already exceeded 8 figure in ARR and more than 1,000 customers. And as we are further developing them, we are confident these products will lead to a broader set of use cases for a larger set of customers over time. Now moving on to this core business drivers. At a high level, Q3 was overall very similar to Q2 with strong performance in new logos and new product attach activities tempered by growth of user from existing customers that further healthy was below our long-term historical average. This added up to sequential net ARR added that was similar to Q2. To give you a bit more color, first, on the usage trend. As we said, user growth was overall solid, but consistent with Q2 trends. From a product perspective, [indiscernible] was more homogeneous among our major products than it had been in Q2. Looking at industry verticals, similar to last quarter, we continue to see a more pronounced effect in consumer discretionary and in particular with our customers that are cognitive and fully scaled into public cloud. Note that the consumer discretionary vertical represents low-teens percent of our ARR and includes e-commerce, as well as food and delivery. All that said, we are pleased with our Q3 strong performance. Revenue in Q3 grew 61% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter, with all of our products meaningfully outperforming the growth of the large cloud providers. While the macroeconomic environment is likely to remain a headwind in the near-term, we continue to see positive trends underpinning our business and remain bullish about the long-term opportunities and aggressive with our investment plan. First, we continue to see strong growth in new logo ARR, including some large wins in traditional industries. We'll talk about some of those in a bit.  Second, our sales pipeline is strong heading into Q4 for both new logos and new products. And we're seeing great opportunities across customer sizes, geography and industry. Alongside our strength in new logo ARR, which gives us confidence that visual transformation and cloud migration remain a top priority. It's perhaps even more critical in difficult times when businesses need to be more agile and do more with less. Remember that given our usage specifi models, new logos wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue, but they are very important to us as new customers expand their usage in subsequent new quarters and subsequent years. Third, we are seeing continued expansion on our platform as indicated by customers adopting more of our products. And finally, churn remains low and hasn't changed with gross revenue retention steady in the mid to high-90s. We believe this high-gross revenue retention is indicative of the business criticality to have Datadog for our customers. Now let's move on to product and R&D. Few weeks ago, we had our Dash user conference, which was an occasion to showcase the expansion of our products and the results of our R&D investments. Let me go through some of these starting with visibility [ph] before moving on to security, developer experience; and finally, the ability to take action within Datadog. First, we are doubling down on our investments in the visibility, starting with two new products, Data Stream Monitoring and Cloud Cost Management, both addressing growing needs and strong demand from our customers. We also extended our APM fleet to offer mobile app testing, user heat maps and Dominic instrumentation. On the network side, we added 70 traps and metro monitoring to our products. On the lodging side, we announced [indiscernible] which coupled with live archives and the visibility pipeline that is at the center of our customers better management. Responding to customer demand. We also expanded our sensitive data scanner beyond logs to identify sensitive data across APM and RAM. And across the platform, we've announced expanded support for open telemetry, PCI compliance for APM and Log, as well as EPA compliance across most of Datadog. Second, we are extending our security platform, and we announced cloud security management, which brings together cloud workload security, cloud security posture management and resource catalog as a frictionless reach and context aware, cloud native application protection platform or CNAP. We launched massive protection for application security management to enable blocking attacks in real time directly within Datadog platform and we now provide venerability monitoring to give our users a high-fidelity picture of all applications production as well as the dependencies, renewability and the attack rate base. Third, we follow through with our recent entry in developer experience. We announced continuous testing to facilitate end-to-end testing as soon as the coding develop, which increases quality and velocity at the same time. And we showcase intelligent test runner using our rich APM and propylene data to automatically keep united tests and drastically reduce time and money spent on CICD. Fourth and last but not least, we announced new product areas that take our platform for observing to allowing our users with action and response all within Datadog. We announced our asset management products to allow our users to correlate and summarize alerts, events and issues, movies associates in order to resolve problems directly from the Datadog area of concern. We also announced Datadog workflows, which allows customers to develop and run ultimately DevOps or security remediation using no code editor and already more than 200 integrations to service they use. We announced lease availability for hosting the collaboration meeting tool that we acquired last year, RUM's real-time screen sharing installation point in Datadog. And finally, we kept on expanding the scope of our watchdog AIM energy. Further automating the detection and guiding the resolution of application in the cost problems. As for dominance from NASH. And as you can tell, the team has been hard at work, and I'm extremely proud of our innovation velocity and focus on our customers. And lastly on products. As we announced in the press release issued this morning, we acquired Cloud Craft, a planning design tool used by tens of thousands of cloud optics to create [indiscernible] , including real-time health, configuration and cost data and we are very excited for their team to bring to Datadog. Now moving on to sales and marketing. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q2. First, we signed a 7-figure land with approaching 100 grocery chain. This company was mitigating to Azure, but was held back by their open source solution. And because this grocery chain has fanatic better controls around personally investing fair information. Our extensive data center and our HIPPA compliance filled that gap amd were differentiators for Datadog giving this opportunity. Next \u2013 we signed a 7-figure land with a major multinational restaurant chain, this company had a legacy availability solution that wasn't able to scale with their vision of subunits and severe environment. They also needed an end-to-end view of their customer journey, and we will now use their paradox products, including Synthetics and RUM to drive customer experience improvement. Next, we signed a 7-figure land with a social networking app. This company was previously a Datadog customer but had moved several years ago to a competitor as maybe certain languages where APM product is going to go well at the time. Today, our APM not only magical abilities of the solution, but presented significant advantages in terms of either deployment, alerting and [indiscernible] detection. And we also plan to take advantage of our new service catalog, taking Datadog at the center of the operation. Next, we had a seven-figure up-sell with a large Asia-based technology conglomerate. This company is many business units include consumer electronics and IoT. And the use of Datadog has grown rapidly with the number of devices we are managing. We had a number of benefits from using Datadog including lowering the amount of buckets by 25% and a high time to resolution by 50%. We have also seen a significant sensing in incident response activity by encode engineers from 20 hours, 22 hours per week. With this new, this customer has now adopted 14 Datadog products. Next, we had an eight-figure multiyear upsell with a large e-commerce company. This customer had been using primarily infrastructure monitoring and APM with Datadog and he was also operating an open source of input. Using Datadog led to significant efficiency including certain customer impacting incidents by close to two-thirds and reducing the number of employees required to address each incident by one-third. With this renewal, they are adopting Datadog Log Management and ROM and consolidating multiple home growth and cloud-mated tools as well as a commercial competitor. That's it for this quarter's customer highlights, and I'd like to thank our go-to-market team for the award and for delivering another strong quarter. Now let me speak to our longer-term outlook. We recognize the macro environment remains uncertain. We continue to see no change to the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. And we remain confident that we can help our customers with their efforts to sell on costs, drive credit engineering efficiency and take advantage of the benefits of cloud and other next-gen technologies. So we are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to capture our long-term opportunity. We remain laser focused on bringing value to our customers as we manage through more challenging economic environment. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David? Yes, the situation is fairly different now from what we saw in COVID. First of all, [indiscernible] very good, very broad, everyone was planning to serve money as quickly as possible, which is not what we're seeing today. What we're seeing today is few of things actually. First of all, everything that is related to direct transactions with customers, whether it's new logos or new products, all of that is actually working great, but the demand we can see there is as strong as we've seen it. When you look at the usage and where you might see cost optimization, I think there are two different stories there. There's these customers that are largely cloud native and normally pretty scale in the tough environment, so then have cloud end-to-end on public cloud that are definitely planning to save money. And these are companies that, in general, also tend to have their own growth rates affected or probably affected in the future by the macro trends. So that's why they're doing that. But when you look at the other customers, the ones that are earlier in their cloud migration, they are actually not slowing down, and we see the same urgency and eagerness for them to keep scaling and keep moving into the cloud. And that's also where the bulk of our opportunities. When you compare us to the hyperscalers, the -- we are seeing some expenses they see when -- and by the way, I should say, it's always hard to do -- to draw a direct comparison between the numbers of hyperscalers and ours. Their numbers include a bunch of a lot of things beyond infrastructure. And we're also not just in public cloud, but also might quite a bit of a private environment as well. But we're seeing some of what they're seeing in terms of optimization. We're a little bit less sensitive to it because we tend to -- because of what we do, we tend to skew towards more critical environment than everything that might in the hyperscaler. And overall, all of our products meaningfully outperformed the growth of the hyperscalers. And again, that is different from COVID. In that, COVID was really a cash crunch that was a little bit we were worried about. And so they are trying to prevent money from going out of the door right way. Like in this case is more preparing for an environment where they might want to watch a profitability a bit more. And customers, when they negotiate on these difficult ones that are fully scaled, the one thing they look for is more cautionary in terms of how long they can be for and how much it can follow period of time when they're -- especially when they be unsure of their own growth rates. Yes. So bigger picture we -- I mean, fairly well, everybody is talking about it. I could imagine they are the only ones speak about, they need to bring security to get an app, and have given up their -- a lot of responsibility in that. So -- and we're confident that this is -- we see that developing in a way that's very similar to what we see with DevOp about a decade ago. So this gives us that confidence. In terms of our traction, we're happy with where we are. We see -- we have -- we mentioned earlier, thousands of customers [indiscernible] the products, the customer business is growing fast, the revenue is growing fast, but it's not like growth for grow in the end, typically, as this product is very fast. And what we see is a lot of market pull of attraction with. There's a lot of customers who want us to be there, and there's a lot of product investments we've seen here today. Some of that in a Dash and there's a lot more coming. So it's working as planned that we'd say at this point. I mean, you're right that cost management is on a lot of people's minds right now. But I would say that it was a really big case six months ago and even a year ago. I think any company that is fully scaled into the cloud cares about their efficiency and they seem that have quite a bit of leverage in terms of cost improvement if they get it the right way with the right tool. So we think it's a product that, yes, it's well timed, but we think it's a product that's going to be -- that has the potential of being very adaptive and very useful for a very long time even after we come out of this challenging macro environment. Keep in mind that different aspects that the -- part of it is driven by the new logos where we're getting from customers. Part of it is driven by the growth of existing customers. And the one we actually get also is -- it's tougher to grow customers very fast when they're growing with us a lot over the past few years when customers have grown in the 80% year-over-year, 30% year-over-year through all these years, they may go away before after that. But in turn, it might give us an easier compare for the future. Well, we do see a little bit of both. I think it's interesting what we've seen in the past. There's no other new trend there, but we see that happening across our customers. We think also in the future, this is going to only become more compelling when customers also bring to us more of their security use cases, more of their user analytics use cases. So these so far have required different copies of the data to different to different vendors, and this tends to be the most expensive part of the other one, the part of the cost structure that scales in the [indiscernible] vendors. So we think we make a very compelling long-term proposition with these customers. Yeah. So the majority of those contracts for large customer view of products are made on what we call the drawdown, which is basically setting committed amount of credit that customers can use. In relation to that, they get a red card for all the values queue [ph] that are going to consume. And those red clients can also be negotiated. Some customers use very large amounts of certain products, they can get a better rate of those specific products as well as to negotiate that. I think that's where it gets a little bit taller to that specific use cases in the business. The benefit for them is just -- they usually don't know how much of each of the products they are going to consume ahead of time. But overall, with the shape up there or the size of the environment is going to be, but also don't know within this environment how much APM traces that would need versus logs versus metric versus really use our monitoring, is there anything else that we produce. So it gives them the flexibility there. And again, that's another reason to bring in more tooling of platform because they don't have to pre-commit everything in separate buckets basically. Yes. So on FX, sorry, David, if I'm stealing your thoughts out. The -- we charge in dollars everywhere. So we don't have any formal FX risk. We don't provide any adjusted numbers for FX, any of that. We do, however, our customers buy our products from Europe and from Japan, their budgets are still in Japanese yen or in euros. And so we do think that the strong dollar is a headwind for us. We don't see very dramatically different growth rates between Europe, Americas and APAC. So we think we might see higher growth in APAC and Europe, which are smaller parts of our revenues and less mature if the dollar was weaker. It is conjecture. We can't actually quantify that because we're charging dollars everywhere, but that's something that we are aware of. Yes. So Cloudcraft is very interesting, because it's a very great product. There are lots of opportunities in terms of integrating product with ours. There are opportunities also with some part of this product many stand-alone. It's a product that works very well for planning and for cloud architects in general to start their planning their document in cloud migration. It's also interesting for us from a distribution perspective because it has a lot of different users today, it has a very broad reach. It's also very easy to embed on third-party sites. So there are a number of opportunities we're excited about with Cloudcraft. You'll see more as we integrate and as we pursue these opportunities. But we're very excited with the opportunity that we have been tracking for a while. No, I think the one thing you're trying to get through the over time during the quarter, we exited the quarter pretty much at where we entered it. There's no change there. And again, as David said, we're happy with what we see there, and we're also usually happy with our product. We -- Q4 has a bit more seasonality in other quarters, in particular, December tends to be a little bit weaker as a lot of our customers take time off and sit down their development environment and things in that. It's also been a little bit harder to forecast in recent years with the pandemic and the behavior that -- the vacation behavior that change after the pandemic. So we are little bit careful with that, and that's all incorporated in our guidance. Just to restate that, we did make changes, we're investing from an R&D perspective, this was so early, there's so much we want to do, and we have great tractions on the products, and we keep investing there. From a go-to-market perspective, as I mentioned on the call, we actually have a very strong pipeline and the conversion with customers are going right in terms of new logos and new products. And so there is value in growing the CRC and there is short-term and long-term value there. So we keep doing that. And the last thing I'd say is we -- remember, I keep putting, but we bought only $30 [ph] million from inception to the new company public, we generated a lot more cash since then. We have efficiency that's one of the core parts of our culture. That's how we run the business, where we built it. And as for the model, we've built in terms of fiction-less expansion and other \u2013 some of our products. So we trust that we have the levers and the way we hope to use them to make sure we have the right profitability as well. One big change again -- one big driver for this is -- our early customers we knew because they try to get ahead of the growth and secure better economics. And in times of uncertainty like this one, customers tend to wait and see more. And sometimes, we have slightly work economics a little bit, but there have been many optionality. And so this is why those numbers moved quite a bit. And again, the best predictor of what's going to happen next year, the revenue ramp on which we are. Everything else is a little bit more historic. I mean, look, we see them everywhere. We're growing our teams everywhere. We're going to see on the right relative basis faster in Europe and in APAC than we are in the US. We're also doing the teams in Latin America, which is doing very well for us. So we -- from where we see, we see them in everywhere. We see Europe and Asia are a little bit behind the Americas in terms of maturity of the cloud migration. But they are scaling and it's happening there, the same way it happened in the past. From a competitive perspective, the situation is about the same everywhere, and it hasn't changed in any notable way over the past year, I would say. So there's nothing shocked to say there. It's still a small minority of the deals. It tends to be the only one that are very large because our customers already had something. They already have a large footprint, and we need to migrate over. So these are deals that are large and the one, which is not a matter of the deal. The last matter [indiscernible] are small and grow from there. These are the ones we tend to mention because these are the ones that are most interesting to look at from day one, but this is still a low minority, but we do. We also don't particularly seek those deals. We train our sales team to land as many new logos and new products as possible. And it's better for them to do 10 smaller ones than one larger one. And those 10 smaller ones will each be as big as the one large one in the end. So that's instead of dollar we make for dollar sale activity we spend that's most productive. Well, I think the question is -- I mean, it's mostly what we see the most case in the customers that are fully in the cloud, fully scaled in the cloud. And there, basically, we should expect their cloud bank to grow at the same rate of their top line in the end. And so when their top line part is slowing down a bit, or what is certainly slowing a bit -- they try and slow the expenses as well, which is what we've seen. I think what we can tell you is whether the top line will slowdown and start narrow a little bit or it's getting compressed, I think it all depends on how big of an economic downturn we face, if any. We're not really the business of predicting that. But what we see is for much of those customers, we got a pretty good idea of where they stand because we see what their projected spend growth is when it relates to the relative growth of the business. And I'll just add one thing to your first question. In terms of -- some part of the question is how do we know things are going to get better or worse in the future? I remind you that we have a usage technology [ph] for revenue, and we don't have to wait until the mix renewal to give the new some customers on whether this is better or worse. But the news is good or bad, we get it early. And an example of that is that while the -- broadly in the world, we see Q3 being worse at a macro level than Q2. As far as our business is concerned, Q3 is very, very much in line with Q2 and whatever step function there was in terms of changing the growth rates, so some customers happened in Q2 already and didn't change in Q3. So we are fairly confident that whatever happens with CPC this year. In terms of from a go-to-market perspective, it was similarly as the rest of what we deliver, it expands nicely on top of the rest of the platform. You're right though that we're reaching to some of the more specialized function around like DDAs and people like that. But we also have -- who are not trained as DDAs, solve the issues and role as DDA security there. So we run it, there's a little bit of a difference there. I think today, because of the better business we just reported today, it's not as pronounced as it might be in the future when we start supporting that this is like [Indiscernible], for example, where the position of the DDA is more formalized, I would say. It's -- if you look at the growth by product this time, it's not only closer than it needs to be, there's some variations quarter-to-quarter, a lot is about the same in growth rate. APM is a little bit better and I'm not sure if it's down, but there's nothing really meaningful there. I think some of the effects you might expect from what you have from the hyperscale, we see maybe some of that in the infrastructure, but it's not extremely pronounced. So that's why we can't comment on this. Thank you. Thank you all for listening. I also want to thank, obviously, all Datadogs around the world for working so hard this quarter and that we have been another great quarter. And I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business and joining us at Dash also for the great event. So thank you all, and we'll speak again in Q4."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. In Q3, we continued to execute well and support our customers. Revenue was $437 million, up 61% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers. First, we experienced strong new logo ARR growth and continued low churn again this quarter. We saw existing customer usage growth remain at levels similar to Q2 as customers continue to be more cost-conscious as they manage their businesses. As Olivier noted, we saw a roughly similar sequential growth in ARR dollars added in Q2 as -- in Q3 as in Q2. And we saw a relatively homogenous usage growth amongst our major products during Q3. As with Q2, we saw relatively more deceleration in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food and delivery. And we saw similar growth across geographies. As a reminder, we bill all of our revenue in US dollars, and we do not price in local currencies. Our dollar-based net retention remained at strong levels above 130% for the 20th consecutive -- 21st consecutive quarter. Our land and expand model, aggressive product innovation and our customers' motion to the cloud continue to drive expansion opportunities with our existing customer base. Overall, the customer usage growth we're seeing remains higher than the trough growth we experienced at the beginning of COVID in 2020, and we're pleased with our 61% year-over-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth this quarter. Meanwhile, gross revenue retention was unchanged and steady in the mid to high 90s. Regardless of the macroeconomic environment, our customers still need to serve their clients and moving to the cloud enables better service and cost savings against people intensive or on-prem technology based offerings. We believe our high and steady gross retention indicates that Datadog is critical to our customer's ability to deliver services to their clients digitally. And as Oli mentioned, on new logos, we saw continued strong new logo ARR growth across geographies, industries and company sizes, and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities in Q4. Finally, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 80% of our customers using two or more products, 40% using four or more products and 16% using six or more products as of the end of Q3. Moving on to our financial statements, billings were $467 million, up 51% year-over-year. Billings duration was slightly lower year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO was $941 million, up 31% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the mid-40s year-over-year. As a reminder, we signed several large multiyear renewals in Q3 2021, which may make current RPO, a more useful indicator with -- as it excludes the multiyear duration impact. We also had a challenging comparables of that metric as Q3 of last year, current RPO growth was about 100%. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoices and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $348 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 81% last quarter and 78% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the medium to long-term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range. Our Q3 non-GAAP OpEx grew 65% year-over-year as we continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market. Q3 operating income was $75 million or a 17% operating margin compared to an operating income of $44 million or a 16% operating margin in the year ago quarter. Then turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $84 million in the quarter after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $67 million for a free cash flow margin of 15%.  Now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022. First, informing our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers. And as usual, we are basing our guidance on current economic conditions, which includes slower than historical growth in usage among existing customers as we have seen in Q2 and Q3.  For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $445 million to $449 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $56 million to $60 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.18 to $0.20 per share range based on an approximate 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  For fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.654 billion, which represents 61% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. And non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $304 million with non-GAAP net income per share expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.92 per share, again, based on an approximate 346 million weighted average annual diluted shares.  Now some notes on guidance. As we discussed last quarter, Q4 includes some large input person events, including our Dash user conference, which was held 2 weeks ago, and AWS Reinvent, our largest trade show event of the year. The cost of those events will result in an approximate 300 to 400 basis points effect on margins. As it relates to our capital expenditures, we are adding more office space around the world as we continue to return to office. We expect CapEx of about $15 million in Q4.  In conclusion, while we recognize macroeconomic uncertainty continued into Q3, we see no change in the importance of cloud migration and digital transformation, which are critical to our customers' competitive advantage. We believe we are well positioned to help our customers embark on these journeys and we are investing aggressively into our long-term opportunities while maintaining our financial stress. I want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their participation in these efforts. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. No, we really haven't seen any difference in billing terms or DSOs for that matter. So on that side, given the mission-critical nature of the product, we haven't seen any material changes in that. Yeah. As a reminder, we provide guidance in a consistent way. We essentially look at the environment, the performance and given the usage model, we put conservative assumptions on top of that. We employed that for the guidance we gave here in Q4. For next year, we'll provide guidance when we report Q4 and plan to update everybody at that time. And not to add, that's what we've been talking about the frictionless adoption where the client is using the platform. And given this drawdown with a rate card, they can use the products in a frictionless way as they expand their use of the Datadog platform. But in that -- just to add, in that sector, we commented on the predominant effect would be what's happening in their business, in their sector rather than geographical location of the company and its customers. Just to make sure it's clear, it's a small company. It's an acqui-hire like we've done, meaning we are bringing on board the engineers, it does come with a customer base. It's an immaterial amount of revenues relative to our total. And as Oli mentioned, provides an extension of the platform, as well as potentially some leads and some lead generation in the customers and personas. Yeah. So we -- for linearity, it was very similar linearity to what we've had. There was no difference. And so we saw -- unlike last quarter a bit, we saw pretty much of a pro rata type of quarter. And we normally have a strong October in terms of the flow of our customers and what they're doing in the platform before pro freezes. We're pleased with what we have seen so far, but still recognize that October is usually strong for us. And it's only the beginning of the quarter. Oli, anything else you want to add that? Yeah. And remind everybody what we said in the script was that the Q3 performance was very similar in its drivers to Q2. So that's further evidence of, as Oli said, that's the conditions that we ended Q2 will continue throughout the Q3. Yeah. I think as we remind everybody, we've always lived within our means and been limited more by our ability to integrate in a responsible way of quota-carrying reps or R&D for that matter into our company. And we really have not made changes. We had a prudent plan and continued as a reminder to everybody, we think there's a very long-term opportunity, and we're investing behind that. We are cognizant that there's more volatility in microeconomic conditions, and we're looking at everything, but we didn't get out over our skis up to begin with in our plan. So it allows us given our model and the way we run the company to continue that investment in a systematic way. Yeah, I think we had -- the comps are very significant in this quarter. In Q3 of last year, and I think we said this at the time, we had some large multiyear deals. As a reminder, we don't try to target multiyear deal we had from the client side. So that's why the current probably is more over time correlated. It is also moves. So if you look at the average of this, it tends over the longer time to correlate with revenues, but there's a lot of noise in this number. So we steer everyone back to revenues and then the computation we've given everybody how to convert revenues into ARR. Just to clarify, so that's not exactly correct what you said. So it is -- so essentially, most of our customers are essentially land and expand and then commit and then grow their usage over time. And that has been going on in the whole model of the company. What we said last time was -- this is not related to they're cutting their commitment. This is related to when there are an overt on demand whether they decide to do a new commitment or stay on demand longer and to be able to get greater visibility. The comment from last quarter was really more about billing and those metrics then about customer usage. We said that customer usage has been lower than historical trends, but not as low as it was in COVID. So that's another effect. And what we talked about last quarter was more about the billing effect. So we continue to say that customers are, as we talked about, cautious, but that really only has a marginal effect in the billing. And actually, when a client decides that and stays on demand, it has a positive effect on the revenue side in that micro decision. Sure. So we don't give more pointed net retention, but it is a fact that if the organic rate -- expanding rate of customers is lower than it was in previous periods, and we said that the rate is lower than it was at the peak but not as low as it was at the low and COVID in the middle that, that would indicate that net retention would be going down mathematically. But we don't give more information than that. As far as the -- and I think we said a little bit about this in the past, as far as the mix between expansion of existing solutions and new as clients adopt more of the solution in their land, which we said is happening. What happens again, mathematically is that the percentage of the net retention from existing products goes up despite the fact that, as we said, we have very strong adoption of additional products. But we also have very strong momentum in client landing with more products, which affects that number directionally, if that makes sense. Yeah. Just clarify that wasn't extra. That's just the total amount, not the delta between the quarters. We haven't provided that type of guidance. We are expanding and building out offices. And again, when we provide guidance for next year, we'll endeavor to provide some guidance that will help in the modeling. Thanks."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report strong results in Q2 as we executed well, and we extended our category leadership. Let me start off with a review of our Q2 financial performance. In Q2, revenue was $406 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 21,200 customers, up from about 16,400 in the year ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,420 customers with ARR of 100,000 or more, up from 1,570 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. We generated free cash flow of $60 million and a free cash flow margin of 15%. And our dollar based net retention rate continues to be over 130%, as customers increased their usage and adopted more products. Now moving on to this quarter's business drivers. In Q2, while we overall saw strong customer growth dynamics, we have seen some variability in growth among our customers. We saw our larger spending customers continue to grow but at a rate that was lower than historical levels. This effect was more pronounced in certain industries, particularly in consumer discretionary, which includes e-commerce and food and delivery customers and affected more specifically our products with a strong volume based component such as log management and APM suite. Note that we did not see this with our SMB and lower spending customers who continued growing with us as they have in the past. While these near growth data points and the current micro climate are leading us to be prudent with our short term outlook, we remain very bullish about our opportunities and confident in our execution as we continue to see positive trends underpinning our business. First, the number of hosts and containers being monitored by our customers is growing steadily, which points to continued momentum of cloud migration and digital transformation projects. Second, we had strong execution on the new logo side as new logo ARR was robust as we added a record 1,400 new customers in the quarter, including the impact of turning off about 200 customers in Russia and Belarus in Q2. And we closed a number of sizable six to seven figure year-over-year deal during the quarter with diverse customers, including a media conglomerate, a metal ore mining company, a US government agency, the SaaS business and a hyperscaler. Third, our pipeline of large new logos and new product cross-sells going into the second half of the year is strong. And fourth, churn remains low with gross revenue retention steady in the mid to high 90s. Moving on to our products. We are pleased with the continued adoption and expansion of our products for our customers. The three pillars of Observability, which are infrastructure, APM and log management all grew strongly in Q2. Our APM suite and log management now exceeds $0.75 billion of ARR. As a reminder, we define APM suite as including core APM, Synthetics, RUM and Continuous Profiler. In addition to that, infrastructure monitoring continued to grow strongly on par with recent quarters. We're also pleased with the adoption of our newer products. Our newer products, excluding infrastructure monitoring, APM suites and log management, continue to grow ARR more than 100% year-over-year. And we've seen a strong start with our CI Visibility product, which we announced at Dash last year and started charging for just a few months ago. CI Visibility already has more than 1,000 paying customers, including some product specific new logos. Our platform strategy also continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 79% of customers were using two or more products, up from 75% a year ago. 37% of customers were using four or more products, up from 28% a year ago and 14% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 6% a year ago. Now let's move on to product and R&D, where our teams delivered another strong quarter of innovation. In June, Gartner published a 2022 Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and Observability. Datadog has once again been the leader, and having improved from last year on our scores and ranking in all dimensions. We attribute this to - first to our unified platform experience covering DevOps, securities, and order to preserve [ph] in one place. But we also see it as a recognition of the continued evolution of Watchdog, our AI engine, which takes over the complexity of monitoring cloud native architectures and provides proactive alerts, carry trouble shooting and fully automate with cloud analysis. We're very pleased that our APM product went from GA to best-of-breed in just five years, and I want again to congratulate our teams for this achievement. In June, we announced the general availability of Observability Pipelines, the 15th product in Datadog platform. As a reminder, this is based on our 2021 acquisition of Timber, the company behind a very popular open source project named Vector. As organizations scale their applications, the volume of telemetry data grows exponentially. Engineers must manage large volumes of metrics, traces and logs and wrap them from many sources to better destination [ph] And this complexity leads to vendor lock-in, core data quality, risks of sensitive data leaks and an increase in overall management costs. By using Datadog Observability Pipelines, customers can control the cost and volume of data, decouple data sources from their destination, standardize and improving data quality and redact sensitive data to have maintained compliance. Next, we announced the general availability of Audit Trail in June, helping businesses safely adopt Datadog platform, while maintaining compliance, enforcing governance and building greater transparency. And this week, we announced the general availability of Service Catalog. With cloud architectures, customers are often creating hundreds of thousands of interconnected services, which are owned and developed by globally distributed teams. This large network of services often makes Root Cause Analysis difficult, which can be challenging to understand what to do to remediate issues or who to call for help. Our Service Catalog inventory services defines team ownerships and displays configurations independencies very similarly to what CMDBs might do or where CMDBs are typically manually populated. Our Service Catalog can identify this information automatically as it was specifically designed for the cloud EDGE. Finally, this morning, we announced that we acquired Seekret, which is spelled S-E-E-K-R-E-T. Seekret API Observability Platform gives engineering teams to control their needs to better manage their private, public and third-party sets of APIs. With Seekret, we will accelerate on our path to bring customers visibility into the APIs and overtime, unlock new exciting capabilities for our APM suite on our security platform. That's it for our product update this quarter. And needless to say, we're all very grateful to our engineering and product teams for their continued hard work. Now moving on to sales and marketing. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q2. First, we signed a 7-figure upsell with a global services and audit company. This customer is going through a large-scale digital transformation, including migrating from on-prem data centers to multiple clouds and in particular, Azure. They are consolidating nine disparate legacy and open source tools to Datadog as their strategic platform and purchase all of our products, as well as our premier support and technical account management services. Next, we had a seven figure upsell with a managed service provider in Asia that is a top [indiscernible] partner in the region. This customer transitioned from their legacy monitoring tool to Datadog and adopted the entire Datadog platform. They are experiencing rapid growth as they sell their MSP services to Edvard U.S. and CDN customers, and we are expanding the opportunity as well as ours in APAC. Next, we had a seven figure land with a multinational media company. This customer has aggressive expansion plans for its streaming service, including in international markets. But they found that their current mix of open source and legacy solutions wasn't meeting their needs. They calculated Datadog [indiscernible] simply by accelerating resolution of just one of their major incidents and avoiding loss of revenue. This customer started with infrastructure, APM and log management, with the opportunity to expand and to more usage in products as the company scales. Next, we had a six figure land with a Fortune 500 logistics company. Three years ago, this customer chose legacy monitoring providers and homegrown solutions over Datadog. Now our platform has come a long way since then. Meanwhile, incumbents were unable to meet these customers' needs, particularly around their communities adoption, leading to dozens of high-profile incidents a year with a high time to resolution. Additionally, these customer expects to save nearly $3 million in developer resources by consolidating multiple products with Datadog. Finally, we had a six figure land with a gaming division at hyperscaler. Previously, this company was primarily using open source and its own hyperscaler native tooling. But despite deep technical expertise, homegrown solutions were lacking granularity and consumed critical engineering resources. By using Datadog, this customer unlocked a prescriptive way to visualize alert and maintain the cloud gaming services. In addition to these wins, we also had a number of sizable six and seven figure new logo and expansion wins with companies that have recently experienced business contraction and announced staff reductions. These customers are looking to streamline their operations, save on engineering costs or consolidate multiple vendors on the strategic platform. We believe that software is a deflationary force and we are confident in our ability to help our customers do more with less, should economic conditions worsen. And these were this quarter's customer highlights, I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their efforts and continued execution. Now let me speak to our longer-term outlook. We recognize the macro environment is uncertain as we look into the back half of 2022. But we also see no change to the long-term trends towards cloud-based services and modern DevOps environments, and Observability remains critical to that journey. We continue to drive market leadership and for our customer's value, efficiency and cost savings to solve their complex monitoring problems. As a result, we continue to feel very confident in our opportunities. We believe cloud migration and digital transformation are drivers of our long-term growth and our multiyear trends that are still early in their life cycle. And we believe it is increasingly critical for companies to embark on these journeys in order to move faster, serve their customers better and in times like these become more efficient with their infrastructure and engineering investments. So we plan to continue to invest in our solid priorities to execute on these long-term opportunities. At the same time, we will continue to closely monitor the demand environment and we'll calibrate further, if necessary, to balance our long-term investments with financial strength. Before I hand it over to David, I wanted to make a couple of announcements. First, we are holding Dash 2022, our user conference on October 18 and 19 at the Javits Center in New York City. This is an occasion for us to showcase our latest product innovations and we're excited to show the one that we've been up to. We also will organize an investor meeting at Dash and we'll share more details on it shortly. And last but not least, we are pleased to welcome Titi Cole to our Board of Directors. Titi is CEO of Legacy Franchises at Citigroup and brings over 25 years of experience in senior global leadership roles in the financial services industry. The perspective and experience will be incredibly valuable as we continue to be on scale. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. We delivered strong financial performance in Q2. Revenue was $406 million, up 74% year-over-year and up 12% quarter-over-quarter. As Olivier described, we executed strongly with robust new logo ARR growth, continued low churn and continued strong platform traction. But we did see some customers beginning to manage costs in response to macroeconomic concerns, which impacted our usage growth with some of our existing customers. Looking at our growth with existing customers, our dollar-based net retention was above 130% for the 20th consecutive quarter, remaining strong as we continue to see customers use more existing products and adopt new products on the Datadog platform. We saw usage growth with some existing customers decelerate in Q2 and that deceleration was concentrated in our larger spending customers as opposed to our lesser spending customers, where growth remained steady year-over-year. Amongst our industries, we saw relative deceleration in consumer discretionary customers, which represents low teens percent of our ARR. As a reminder, we are highly diversified in industries and segments. And we saw lower expansion rate weighted towards areas of our platform that have volume-based components like certain aspects of log management and APM. Infrastructure monitoring ARR growth was relatively steady year-over-year. On the other hand, our gross retention remained unchanged and steady in the mid- to high 90s. We believe that our gross retention has reached and is sustaining these levels because of the stickiness of our product and the criticality of our platform to our clients. And as Oli mentioned, our new logos, we saw strong continued new logo acquisition and ARR growth, broadly by geography and across industries and company sizes. Finally, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 79% of our customers now using two or more products, 37% using four or more products, and 14% using six or more products in the Datadog platform as of the end of Q2. Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $397 million, up 47% year-over-year. As in previous quarters, we had some differences in the timing of billings of a few large customers, which were built in Q2 last year but were billed in Q1 this year. And pro forma for those adjustments, billings growth year-over-year was in the mid-50s. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $881 million, up 51% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the mid-50s year-over-year, and contract duration was slightly lower than the year ago quarter. In addition, we observed that some customers aren't changing their level of usage growth but are being more conservative in their commitments, which impacts billings and RPO growth but not revenue growth. As we said in previous quarters, billings and RPO growth can fluctuate significantly and vary from revenue growth, whether higher or lower due to the timing of invoicing and duration of customer contracts. To illustrate this, we note that billings growth for the first half of the year of 2022 was 72% year-over-year. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP, and we have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $328 million, representing a gross margin of 81%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and 76% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of sales this quarter. In the medium to long term, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the high 70s range. Given our success in increasing our investments in R&D and go-to-market, our non-GAAP Q2 OpEx grew 65% year-over-year versus 56% year-over-year in Q1. This included our return to in-person office travel and events, which contributed $11 million to the sequential growth of OpEx. Operating income in Q2 was $85 million or 21% operating margin compared to operating income of $31 million or 13% operating margin in the year ago quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $73 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $60 million with a free cash flow margin of 15%. Our free cash flow margin in the first half of 2022 was 25%. Now for our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2022. First, informing our guidance, we are using conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of customers. Taking into account the macroeconomic uncertainty and recent variability of the growth among certain customers. As Olivier mentioned, we see healthy trends in the host and containers monitored and strong execution in our business, but we recognize customers may have less visibility into their own businesses due to the macroeconomic environment. So for the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $410 million to $414 million, which represents 52% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $51 million to $55 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.15 to $0.17 per share range based on approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.63 billion, which represents 57% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $255 million to $275 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.81 per share based on approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now as regards to our margin guidance, I wanted to point out. First, gross margins have recently been at the top of our historical range. In operating expense, we have returned to in-office attendance, travel and events. We estimate that this was a 300 basis point sequential margin impact in Q2, and we expect an additional 100 basis point sequential margin impact in Q3. As Oli mentioned, in Q4, we will hold our Dash user conference and we will participate in the AWS re:Invent, our largest trade show at the end of the year. The cost of these events will be approximately 400 basis points of margin impact. We're back to fully in-person events this year, and we're excited to get in front of customers and showcase our many product innovations. Next, we have been successful in making R&D and sales and marketing investments, and we believe these will pay off in the future. While we plan to continue to invest, we will remain judicious and disciplined in our cost structure given macro uncertainties. As indicated by the guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins in the second half of 2022 to be in the low double digits. We are healthily profitable on a non-GAAP basis and our free cash flow generative. And we have built a highly efficient, frictionless business model while driving high ROI on our investments over time. Our efficiency and financial strength affords us options in times of macro uncertainty that other market participants will not have, and we intend to make the best of this opportunity to drive our long-term growth. But of course, we are mindful of the environment and are closely monitoring our costs carefully, and we will calibrate further, if necessary, to maintain our financial strength. In conclusion, while we recognize there is greater uncertainty in the macro environment right now, we see no change in the importance of cloud migration and digital transformation, which are critical to our customers' competitive advantage. We believe we are well positioned to help our customers embark on these journeys, and we are investing aggressively into our long-term opportunities while maintaining our financial strength. I want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSanjit Singh: Yeah, thank you taking the questions and really impressive Q2 results with 74% growth. I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the trends you're seeing in the business and particularly with respect to the guide. I guess the first question is, as the quarter progressed, when did you start to see some of these slower usage trends in some of these verticals? If you could give a comment on that? And then, David, in terms of the guidance in terms of how you were framing it, can you give us a sense of what you're sort of assuming in the back half with respect to Q3 and Q4? Is it some of the trends that you're seeing in July, did that improve or stabilize or worsen? And just give us some sort of context on how you are framing the guidance for the back half, that would be super helpful?\nOlivier Pomel: Okay. So I'll start maybe with the linearity. And we did see the viability in usage growth that we mentioned. We saw that start really in late April, May and June. So as we got deeper into the quarter. I should say that this is - if you're thinking of what happened in terms COVID, this is not a sharp pullback as we have seen at that time. But we saw it's just, for some customers still growth, but slower growth for certain types of customers and others than what we would have seen historically. I should say that while we did see that for some of our products, especially the ones that have more of a volume component, net logs and some positive APM, we did see continued healthy growth in host and or I should say, cloud instances and containers, which we're really indicative of the fact that the cloud migration is proceeding as it was before. To fully answer the question also, I think you - maybe are getting ahead of what David is going to talk about a little bit. But in July, we did see an improvement on those trends, but we still remain conservative in our outlook for the short term because of the noisiness of the data we're seeing there. There's a few more valuations, a bit more noise. And all of that is underpinned by some macro uncertainty. So we want to derisk that a little bit and be a bit it more careful. David, do you want to comment on that?\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. On guidance, as you know, we have always been conservative in our guidance by using lower organic growth and other metrics than we've seen historically and continue to maintain that philosophy. I would note that if you look at the raise here and the percentage of the beat that was passed through into the raise from Q2, it is lower, more conservative than we have done in previous quarters. And the reason for that is the macro uncertainty where we can't be as confident about what happens given the macro uncertainty. So I would say there, if you want to take that, there were some incremental conservatism put into this. But I'd remind everybody that we've always been quite conservative in using assumptions that are lower than the past when we give guidance.\nSanjit Singh: That's super helpful. I appreciate all the context. And one more if I could just sneak in one quick question. Olivier, on the comment on which sort of products may be seeing slightly lower usage. I fully understand like the volume-based products like logs that makes complete sense. With APM, though, I'm a little confused on why you might see some deceleration there. Because correct me if I'm wrong, I think that's primarily based on host-based pricing. So any comments on like the APM side versus log side in terms of how cost -- some of the trends you're seeing in terms of usage across those two parts of the portfolio?\nOlivier Pomel: That's a great question. So for APM, there's actually part of APM that looks like logs, which is APM is - part of it is host-based and part of it is traffic-based. If you want to run analytics and have longer retention on certain parts of your APM data, it basically behaves like logs. And that's the part on which we've seen some slower growth. It's still growing, but both are actually still growing healthily, but I would say, slower than they were in recent quarters for these types of customers. And you can do the same thing - with this generative data you can show a little bit more, you can reduce retention, these other levers customers have to control the spend there.\nSanjit Singh: Makes total sense. I got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. The new version of my name, its Meith [ph] Can I stay on that subject, Olivier. So if you think -- is there a different pattern of how people work with you and use you, if you say infrastructure volumes are - or infrastructure is not as much impacted or is not impacted as the log and APM part? Like are you more important on that side because like if I'm thinking like I need to monitor my applications as much as I need to monitor my infrastructure. So I'm just -- like maybe help us understand a little bit the differences there? And then I have one follow-up.\nOlivier Pomel: No, it's just that these are - you have more like short-term levers to actually optimize a little bit in logs and APM, anything that's volume-based. What we've seen customers do is - I mean, really, if we were to cater that customer then we would break them into three buckets. One bucket is the customers that spend a lot with us, have us word to word in their business, now seeing their business slow down. That's what we mentioned in consumer discretionary and for delivery, for example. In those cases, naturally, if customers are themselves are growing 10% to 50%, and they're using several already equivalent to us, they have always been, that's natural. But that's only a small part of our customers. We're very diversified, and we also have a very small part of our customer that uses, to pay us too at this point. The second bucket I would say is customers they have a series he can spend with us. And don't you see a little bit more uncertainty in the future. So their businesses might not be challenged today, but pretty much every CFO or whoever has a mandate to look more closely at their expenses. And what we see those do is they're looking for optimization. They're looking for maybe to find some leaky faucets they can close. And you can typically find some of those in logs, for example. And this is not something new. I mean we've just said before, every customer goes through cycles where they optimize a little bit and then they go again and then they optimize again. What happens in times like that is that you see customers bunched in the same quarter, do we need all at the same time because they're all going through the same macro events. So we're seeing some of that there. And again, this is not comparable in breadth or in magnitude to what we've seen at the beginning of COVID. But still, we see that in the data, so we wanted to call it out on the call. Then the third bucket of...\nRaimo Lenschow: Sorry. Go ahead...\nOlivier Pomel: Just to finish it. I had promised three buckets, I'll deliver you the three. The third bucket is customers that are lesser spend, which in this case, we mean less than $500,000 a year on us. They are basically growing as they were before. They're actually growing more slowly than the larger ones. The larger ones have slowed down a little bit while the smaller ones haven't.\nDavid Obstler: Just want to clarify, when - if you look after the call on our website, you'll see that in APM it's host-based pricing, but there's other parts that are like logs, as Oli mentioned, that are data related that are related to ingestion and indexing. And so what we're saying is that the infrastructure part, both with the infrastructure and the APM didn't experience as much variability, but the ability to tweak the use of the data through both ingestion and indexing which is more of a part of logs, but also a part of APM was where we saw that variability.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. And then the follow-up is if you think about, and I'm sure you have thought about it as you thought about the implications for the second half. Consumer discretionary sounds like the first thing that in the kind of downturn gets impacted. You also mentioned food delivery a little bit, which is kind of seems more like the newer tech companies. Is that something that you kind of anticipate to go through the supply chain? So BPG comes next, fashion retail comes next. How do you think about it or how do you think about that when you were buffering for the second half? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. So we're very diversified. So no particular part of the industry actually covers the large part of our revenue. And also, I would say, we - in terms of those of our customers, they are very following in the cloud migration or that cloud native to start with, we actually probably have more of them in consumer discretionary than in other verticals that we have. So that all that came into consideration when we looked at our guidance.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nKash Rangan: Yeah. I can pronounce Raimo\u2019s name perfectly well. So, thank you. Thanks for giving me chance to ask question here. So I'm curious when you look at AWS and Azure, I mean, much larger business. They had good bookings, I think backlog growth, whatever you want to call it. But if you can help us reconcile your CRPO growth. I'm sure there are company specific things that pertain to how you see of your growth on a year-over-year basis, sequential growth basis. How do we look at that in the context of what's happening with the hyperscalers. And they did put up even during an uncertain time, tremendous backlog growth, whatnot. So is there something specific to Datadog? Maybe it's the 18% or so, high teens percentage exposure to consumer discretionary. Maybe if you parse that out, there is a different way to look at the rest of the business. And if you could quantify how the rest of the business did relative to how the hyperscalers were able to put up that kind of backlog. So I'm trying to just bridge the performance of Datadog versus the public cloud at an aggregate level, if you don't mind. Thank you so much.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So I'll start on the rapid trends with the hyperscalers and then maybe David can give you more color on the bookings part. So in Q2, we did a lot better than the hyperscalers. So we're growing a lot faster than all of them combined. And they've decelerated actually more than we've done in relative basis. So we actually feel good about the ratio there. Like we are commanding a larger portion of the cloud revenue than we were last quarter. In terms of the go forward, I don't think the hyperscalers have to guide specifically for that. But we - in terms of business trends, we see that all of the leading indicators of success are looking good for us. So I've mentioned it on the call but we're seeing great action with new logos. We're seeing great success with new product attaches. The pipeline's going into the second half of the year are very good. We've also done very well with the capacity we've added and the hiring and everything that's a putting to our future. So all of that is looking good. What we don't have necessarily in terms of the gap for the future is we have a little bit of more noise in the data in terms of growth, which leads us to be a little more conservative. David, do you want to give more color on the booking part of it?\nDavid Obstler: Definitely. So remind everybody that with our land and expand where we start getting used by clients, they scale up the growth and when they get to a certain point through, this has been going on for the whole business model. They go to an increased commit. Because of that, there's variability in the billings and RPO that net-net, over time, on average, go towards the ARR growth. Again, remember, we mentioned that the ARR growth is the best metric. And the way to look at that is that you look at the revenues. You take - you use the linearity, which is 34%, 35% of that and multiply that times 12, and that is pure because it doesn't get altered by when a bill goes out either in timing or whether the bill is a previous commitment plus an on-demand or a new commitment. So it's always going to be noisy with us. We understand that investors and analysts look at it. So we try to give some color on that, but remind everybody that, that is very variable and only over time gets -- it comes back to the revenue growth, so just to remind everybody. And I think we said we basically put in there that in the first half of the year, the growth of this was in the 70s, pretty close to revenues. Why? Because there were timing of billing in the first quarter relative to the second quarter that moved the first quarter up and the second quarter down, but it really doesn't have much effect on the drivers of our business.\nOlivier Pomel: And just to be very clear about this, like theoretically, we don't actually manage the business to billings. And that's because it aligns us with our customers. So we manage it to usage, which it turns into revenue pretty directly for us. What this means is we're very heavily - land and expanded. When we land, we typically land small. So that has typically a small impact on billings. And when we expand whether we actually do the expansion this quarter, next quarter that doesn't really matter because it doesn't really change the usage of customers. It doesn't really change their growth profile. It doesn't really change the revenue that we're going to see from them. And so we see some noise there, and we don't manage the business to it.\nKash Rangan: Thank you, Oli and David. Appreciate it.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Your line is now open.\nFatima Boolani: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Oli, one for you and one for David as well, please. Oli, you talked about some wins vis-\u00e0-vis, DIY and open source displacements in your prepared remarks. But I suppose in a more challenged or uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, the free or - if it aren\u2019t broke, don't fix it type model is potentially more attractive. So I'm curious if you can give us some color commentary on how you expect to sort of effectively compete with \"free open source\" alternatives, especially for some of your volume-based solutions? And then I'll follow up for it separately.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So free is actually the most expensive typically because you have to build it yourself. And it turns out people tend to be the most expensive thing for our customers. We mentioned in the script earlier that we actually had a number of sizable wins with customers that had announced layoffs shortly before they actually bought from us for the first time or have big expansions with us. And that's because we have been more efficient. We have been concentrate their efforts where it actually adds to their business as opposed to reinventing - there were more expensive and efficient way themself.\nFatima Boolani: I appreciate that. And David, just for you, I think historically, you've characterized that roughly three quarters of the business is tied to committed and rate card committed type contracts. And I think you were very categorical in mentioning that RPO levels are moderating as some of your customers moderate their commitment level. So I was curious to get your perspective on sort of the next 6 to 12 month impact on increased conservatism around the commit levels as well as how that translates into the quarter of your business that is very much usage and average-oriented. If you could just frame that for us in more of a 6 to kind of 12 month frame from here? And that's it for me.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, we haven't seen - yes, thanks for the question. We haven't seen any change in those numbers. We still have the land, commit, use, grow, we get into on-demand, recommit, but we did say that in the level of conservatism that was introduced to some clients that they may have stayed more into their previous commit plus on demand. Because of that, that doesn't for that situation affect the revenues because they're still consuming the same, but they may want to retain more optionality. This is really sort of in looking at financial management with level of uncertainty. You generally would pay a higher price if you stayed that way, but you'd be trading off the higher unit price, the marginally higher unit price for the more optionality. And we did see some of that. We don't know what's going to happen next, but we would think that if we continue to have macro uncertainty, there will be some customers that will opt for that type of pattern relative to the commitments.\nOlivier Pomel: And we're fine with that, by the way. We designed the business that way. We don't offer large discounts for very large time commitments. And that, again, that's by design, like we actually want to align or success with the [indiscernible]our customers, and we're happy to keep it that way. In times like that, it always play down.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC. Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMatt Hedberg: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Maybe David, a follow-up, I think really to Raimo's question earlier, in your guidance philosophy, did you assume other verticals beyond consumer discretionary slow their usage? And maybe what are the assumptions from smaller customers? It sounded like they actually were fairly strong this quarter.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, to take the second part, I think we saw that in our smaller customers, we had very consistent net and gross retention. We always do that. So our guidance always takes the drivers, which would be the organic or usage growth and the new logos, it always takes it down. So we do that in every quarter. I think you know that from following us. And in this quarter, I mentioned that by passing through less of the beat we inject an incremental level of conservatism. But overall, the philosophy of basically taking all of those things down and it remains at the core of our philosophy of providing guidance.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. Okay. And then was there a geographic element to any of the kind of the slowdown in consumption? Was there a European element? Or was it sort of just broad-based geographic?\nDavid Obstler: There was not. We did not see that. It was not geographic. As we mentioned, it tended to be more either large spend or industry based, but we did not see that geographically.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kamil [Mielczarek ] from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nKamil Mielczarek: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. One for Olivier, maybe. First of all, congrats on the acquisition of Seekret. Dave has always historically done a great job of rapidly integrating these products and launching them as new solutions. I think at Dash, you mentioned that the typical turnaround is one year for these products to become a stand-alone Datadog solutions. However, given the upward trend in cash generation and your cash and equivalents are now approaching $2 billion, have your thoughts changed around potentially making a more transformative acquisition, especially given the decline in market valuations today?\nOlivier Pomel: It's possible. Everything is open. We've looked at some of those in the past. We see the value is higher for larger businesses like that. But we're really looking at valuations coming down and some more opportunities presenting themselves to us there. So everything is possible. But in general, we're very active on the M&A side. I think we'll only be more active as markets temporarily are right now. But there's not much more I can say.\nKamil Mielczarek: Great. And just as a follow-up. Earlier this year, we saw Datadog building out its recruiting engine, and I see you accelerated investments into sales and marketing again this quarter. I think even after adjusting for T&E. Can you update us on where these incremental investments are focused? And given the macro environment, how do you think about the balance between preserving margin versus continuing to hire maybe more aggressively and coming out stronger on the other end. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: So right now, we're aggressively recruiting. We're building capacity. We're successful at it. And I really see it as a predictor of future success. We're in an interesting situation because -- as a company, we are very efficient. We've been very disciplined from the funding of the company. For those of you who have followed us for a long time, we burned less than $30 million on our way to IPO, and we've generated a lot more cash than that since then. So discipline is getting into the DNA of the company. We also built the business around model that is frictionless and extremely efficient. And we've shown this efficiency, I would say, over the past two quarters by growing very fast while being fairly profitable. So we - there's no doubt in our minds about the long-term profitability profile of the company. So what this does is that it affords us opportunities to invest in times like this, that the rest of the market will not have. Last year, everybody could invest, everybody could spend money, it really didn't matter. This year, I think it's a little bit different. So we really see that as an opportunity to break from the back even further and innovate, build self capacity and all those things. Now obviously, as I said earlier, discipline is in the DNA of the company. So we're always looking at what our margins are or the macro environment is. And we have all the levers we need to adjust so we can maintain profitability in the future. David, do you want to comment some more?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. I just want to add that what we said all along was, we try to maintain a steady investment profile, which is focused on R&D and sales and marketing investments. And it's banded by what we can execute, what we feel we can hire, integrate, et cetera. And in periods where there are -- is an acceleration, we said this many times on the top line, we can't invest as fast as that when the top line went up to 80%. So you're going to have margin expansion. That was exaggerated because there were some costs that didn't happen in COVID that are part of our normal business operations. So we try to maintain a steady profile of investment and the variability is with this acceleration of the top line, you might see that because it flows through at such a high marginal rate. And then if you see a deceleration, you might see less of that margin expansion. So that's our philosophy, but it's always to invest and take advantage of the long-term opportunity.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. The last thing I'd say we feel great about the opportunity in general. We feel great about the -- as I mentioned earlier, the leading indicators of success whether it's new logos, product attaches, or product pipeline, our ability to ship it as well as the pipeline we see of customers that are in sales processes with us for new products or just brand new deployments. So we feel great about all that. And this makes us very confident into our investments. What's possible though is that the demand environment is a bit more challenged. There will be a bit of a longer time for us to show around these investments, but we are fine with that.\nKamil Mielczarek: That\u2019s very helpful, color. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill: Good morning. David, I think everyone is still a little confused. You're seeing an inversion with what's happening with SMB and large enterprise. Many companies are kind of weakness in SMB not at large. Can you explain why you think you're seeing this inversion? And are you embedding a more conservative view in the back half?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, not an inversion. I think what we said was -- we did not see what you're saying, which is SMB and smaller customers did not act differently than they had. What we said was whether it's an enterprise mid-market or SMB, what happened was in certain segments, consumer, et cetera, we had a more conservative or a more of a cost mentality. And two, regardless of where it was -- remember SMB for us is 1,000 employees or less, mid-market 1,000 to 5,000, enterprise 5,000 and up. That in the larger areas where there had been substantial expansion, we saw a look at that costs. So those were the determinations. And for us it wasn't Europe, it wasn't that SMB fell out. It was those things. And in terms of the second half of the year, we don't know. But in what we guide always, we assume lower organic growth in all the sectors than we have historically and that we might expect. So I think inversion is the wrong thing because what this -- what happened was the driver of the cost look was not whether it was an SMB mid-market or enterprise, but what the level of spend and the industry.\nOlivier Pomel: One way to see, it is - we're critical to our customers. We're critically important, we deliver value. We have them to be more efficient. So in general, and whether -- whatever the size of the customer is, we're not on the chopping block. But the more customers spend on us, they're going to look for savings where they're spending money, and they're going to see that at a larger levels of spend with us. And as we mentioned earlier, there's always a little bit you can optimize, especially with some of the volume-based product.\nDavid Obstler: And by the way, gross retention stayed the same at all the different levels, SMB, mid-market and enterprise. So when you're talking about, do you have the solution, are you continuing to do solution, we saw no change in the gross retention across all of our customer sizes.\nBrent Thill: Thanks for clarifying.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you for taking the questions. Oli, you're frequently speaking to a lot of Datadog customers, and totally speaking, are they raising more questions about your pricing levels in this environment? Any commentary on that would be helpful.\nOlivier Pomel: So we - were actually very optimistic from our conversion with customers because there's more and more of them. They want to buy more product. They want to use more of our products. They want to -- so it'd be a problem for them. Everybody wants a better deal, but I think that's always been true, and that's always going to be true. And it's even truer in situations like this where the CFOs have a mandate to be more conservative. So -- but anecdotally, from what we see with customers, we're very bullish.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Got it. And then you touched on some interesting examples in your script, but if you were to look back over the past six months or so, I'm wondering whether or not there has been any change to the trajectory of customer consolidation or standardization on Datadog?\nOlivier Pomel: So we keep seeing more and more of it. It's still not the majority of what we do. But we think, again, if the -- there is prolonged macro issues in the market, like we might see more consolidation and customers now want to really try to save on their legacy software by consolidating on us. So we definitely see that as a possibility. Again, that's not the majority of what we do today. That's not what we base any of our projections on, but that's something that we think might happen.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham & Company. Your line is now open.\nMike Cikos: Hey, thanks for taking the questions here, guys. I did just want to come back for that other point previously, regarding the SMB versus enterprise. And really, is it fair to characterize some of the, I guess, movements you're seeing with these larger deals? Is it may be less of an impact to you at the SMB level, either because you're license [ph] has been a wallet share when they're looking to pay out their vendors? Or is it possible that those SMB organizations just have less exposure to your more usage-based products.\nOlivier Pomel: They have the same exposure but simply the difference is, what's your time to say, $5,000. Probably not. If you're a much larger customer, it's worth your time to sell $500,000. And that's what we see with those optimizations.\nMike Cikos: Understood. And then the follow-up I had for you is if I look at the trends for multiproduct adoption from your customers, I think this is the first time we've seen your two plus product module adoption actually declined sequentially from 81% to 79%. Is the implication there that your customers are starting smaller now or deciding to pay -- will take another product from you at a later date? And again, if you could help me parse out that metric, that would be helpful.\nOlivier Pomel: It's just mechanicals because we - I think we said 75% of our new logos are landing with two more products, and we have more new logos. And so this pushes the number down a little bit.\nDavid Obstler: There's nothing, you know, 81%, 79% these are all just - there's nothing, no change in trend.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Weed from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nPeter Weed: Thank you for taking my question. I'm interested in the customers that are doing some cost rationalization. And trying to unpack, is that something that's targeted directly at Datadog? Or is it actually as part of a broader cloud rationalization that you see going on. It just happens to be that Datadog gets pulled into that and may even just see splash on effect as customers are managing their overall cloud topology and with the pricing that pulls down Datadog. Help me unpack those two things, whether or not it's Datadog focused or more of a broader cloud focus.\nOlivier Pomel: It's just focused on their cost structure. So they line up their expenses by decreasing in decreasing order and they heat up everyone at least and they see what they can do to optimize. And again, a number -- you've seen a number of customers that had layoffs. So they're going after their cost structure. Their hard core cost structures that are there -- their workforce and we're part of that. I think that it's a good thing because those customers -- and a lot of us were very critical, one of their top vendors. That means, for those of them who use us both will, like we are, to a certain extent, tied to their own trajectory.\nPeter Weed: Okay. So you're saying that this is very focused on Datadog as a line item and not just a splash on effect necessarily of...\nOlivier Pomel: No, I'm saying let's focusing what they're spending money on. And for some of those, they're spending a lot of money. They're spending more money on cloud in there. I guarantee you, they're also trying to save money on that. And we know that the cloud providers are also working with these customers helping with their spend. I think everybody is aligning trying to make their customers successful there. And we actually have been involved in efforts where we work with the cloud providers and these customers to help them make the most of what they have. And again, in times like this, we want to be on the side of our customers. We want to help them. We want to have them get the most of what they spend on us. so we can have a long-term successful relationship with them.\nDavid Obstler: Now given the stickiness and what we did - just monitoring of real-time application for their clients, we feel that and our experience has been that it is less focused on other things than Datadog, but when you're looking at your cost structure, there are opportunities, as you said, to rationalize across. But generally, if you look at the gross retention, you look at how important Datadog is to the businesses. And you read the newspapers, you see that it's focused on other things more.\nPeter Weed: Yes. Yes. No, no, that makes sense. And one other last question, if you may. I think you alluded to some timings of some contracts over quarters and this type of thing. In that there may have even been some improvements in July and some of the momentum of closing contracts. Can you comment on some of those improvements and how you see them kind of juxtaposed with some of the other caution that you're talking about and have to.\nOlivier Pomel: I think the improvements in July were not about closing contracts. The one I mentioned were about the usage trends, which is fairly quite a selling force from the closings and the contracts and everything else. We also -- again, a great pipeline, and we're very happy with what we've seen sell side in July, but this is where -- which we commented about the usage.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, like they're always -- I think it's been on calls over time. Every call, if there is some timing differences to the positive, billing was in this quarter. We try to point it out because when the bill goes out or when the commitment is not -- is not as correlated to the revenues as ARR is. So we - I think we said that on every - almost every earnings call, and we just remind everybody all the time that because of the land-expand model that you're going to have variability plus and minus. And when it's plus, we want to remind everybody not to read anything into it. And when it's less, we want to remind everybody that that's not the major metric that drives top line growth of the company.\nPeter Weed: Sure. But I mean, if you've got utilization, it should turn into additional revenue in future periods, and I think you're mentioning kind of a positive trajectory, do you see...\nOlivier Pomel: Usage actually is revenue in the same period. Like it's two others are one and the same. There's no delay between those two. But there's a delay - we were - now there was billings.\nPeter Weed: Yes, and I guess what I'm getting at is, if you see that positive trajectory in July, it will turn into revenue in the period. How are you seeing that going forward...\nDavid Obstler: Yes. But we're making marginal, yes, we're telling you that we're telling - saying that unlike in COVID there was -- that we had strong usage growth. We had usage growth in a lot of places and on average, in the second quarter. What we're saying is that in July, we saw pockets where there was a little better usage growth, but we're not calling the market here. We're basically reporting what we see and what we hope is the most helpful in a formative way. So yes...\nPeter Weed: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This has concluded the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to CEO, Olivier Pomel, for closing comments.\nOlivier Pomel: All right. Thank you. I want to thank everyone for spending time with us on the call. And again, I want to thank all of Datadog employees for a great quarter and for continuing build a fantastic company and so proud of our customers. So thank you all, and we'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report strong results in Q2 as we executed well, and we extended our category leadership. Let me start off with a review of our Q2 financial performance. In Q2, revenue was $406 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 21,200 customers, up from about 16,400 in the year ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,420 customers with ARR of 100,000 or more, up from 1,570 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. We generated free cash flow of $60 million and a free cash flow margin of 15%. And our dollar based net retention rate continues to be over 130%, as customers increased their usage and adopted more products. Now moving on to this quarter's business drivers. In Q2, while we overall saw strong customer growth dynamics, we have seen some variability in growth among our customers. We saw our larger spending customers continue to grow but at a rate that was lower than historical levels. This effect was more pronounced in certain industries, particularly in consumer discretionary, which includes e-commerce and food and delivery customers and affected more specifically our products with a strong volume based component such as log management and APM suite. Note that we did not see this with our SMB and lower spending customers who continued growing with us as they have in the past. While these near growth data points and the current micro climate are leading us to be prudent with our short term outlook, we remain very bullish about our opportunities and confident in our execution as we continue to see positive trends underpinning our business. First, the number of hosts and containers being monitored by our customers is growing steadily, which points to continued momentum of cloud migration and digital transformation projects. Second, we had strong execution on the new logo side as new logo ARR was robust as we added a record 1,400 new customers in the quarter, including the impact of turning off about 200 customers in Russia and Belarus in Q2. And we closed a number of sizable six to seven figure year-over-year deal during the quarter with diverse customers, including a media conglomerate, a metal ore mining company, a US government agency, the SaaS business and a hyperscaler. Third, our pipeline of large new logos and new product cross-sells going into the second half of the year is strong. And fourth, churn remains low with gross revenue retention steady in the mid to high 90s. Moving on to our products. We are pleased with the continued adoption and expansion of our products for our customers. The three pillars of Observability, which are infrastructure, APM and log management all grew strongly in Q2. Our APM suite and log management now exceeds $0.75 billion of ARR. As a reminder, we define APM suite as including core APM, Synthetics, RUM and Continuous Profiler. In addition to that, infrastructure monitoring continued to grow strongly on par with recent quarters. We're also pleased with the adoption of our newer products. Our newer products, excluding infrastructure monitoring, APM suites and log management, continue to grow ARR more than 100% year-over-year. And we've seen a strong start with our CI Visibility product, which we announced at Dash last year and started charging for just a few months ago. CI Visibility already has more than 1,000 paying customers, including some product specific new logos. Our platform strategy also continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 79% of customers were using two or more products, up from 75% a year ago. 37% of customers were using four or more products, up from 28% a year ago and 14% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 6% a year ago. Now let's move on to product and R&D, where our teams delivered another strong quarter of innovation. In June, Gartner published a 2022 Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and Observability. Datadog has once again been the leader, and having improved from last year on our scores and ranking in all dimensions. We attribute this to - first to our unified platform experience covering DevOps, securities, and order to preserve [ph] in one place. But we also see it as a recognition of the continued evolution of Watchdog, our AI engine, which takes over the complexity of monitoring cloud native architectures and provides proactive alerts, carry trouble shooting and fully automate with cloud analysis. We're very pleased that our APM product went from GA to best-of-breed in just five years, and I want again to congratulate our teams for this achievement. In June, we announced the general availability of Observability Pipelines, the 15th product in Datadog platform. As a reminder, this is based on our 2021 acquisition of Timber, the company behind a very popular open source project named Vector. As organizations scale their applications, the volume of telemetry data grows exponentially. Engineers must manage large volumes of metrics, traces and logs and wrap them from many sources to better destination [ph] And this complexity leads to vendor lock-in, core data quality, risks of sensitive data leaks and an increase in overall management costs. By using Datadog Observability Pipelines, customers can control the cost and volume of data, decouple data sources from their destination, standardize and improving data quality and redact sensitive data to have maintained compliance. Next, we announced the general availability of Audit Trail in June, helping businesses safely adopt Datadog platform, while maintaining compliance, enforcing governance and building greater transparency. And this week, we announced the general availability of Service Catalog. With cloud architectures, customers are often creating hundreds of thousands of interconnected services, which are owned and developed by globally distributed teams. This large network of services often makes Root Cause Analysis difficult, which can be challenging to understand what to do to remediate issues or who to call for help. Our Service Catalog inventory services defines team ownerships and displays configurations independencies very similarly to what CMDBs might do or where CMDBs are typically manually populated. Our Service Catalog can identify this information automatically as it was specifically designed for the cloud EDGE. Finally, this morning, we announced that we acquired Seekret, which is spelled S-E-E-K-R-E-T. Seekret API Observability Platform gives engineering teams to control their needs to better manage their private, public and third-party sets of APIs. With Seekret, we will accelerate on our path to bring customers visibility into the APIs and overtime, unlock new exciting capabilities for our APM suite on our security platform. That's it for our product update this quarter. And needless to say, we're all very grateful to our engineering and product teams for their continued hard work. Now moving on to sales and marketing. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q2. First, we signed a 7-figure upsell with a global services and audit company. This customer is going through a large-scale digital transformation, including migrating from on-prem data centers to multiple clouds and in particular, Azure. They are consolidating nine disparate legacy and open source tools to Datadog as their strategic platform and purchase all of our products, as well as our premier support and technical account management services. Next, we had a seven figure upsell with a managed service provider in Asia that is a top [indiscernible] partner in the region. This customer transitioned from their legacy monitoring tool to Datadog and adopted the entire Datadog platform. They are experiencing rapid growth as they sell their MSP services to Edvard U.S. and CDN customers, and we are expanding the opportunity as well as ours in APAC. Next, we had a seven figure land with a multinational media company. This customer has aggressive expansion plans for its streaming service, including in international markets. But they found that their current mix of open source and legacy solutions wasn't meeting their needs. They calculated Datadog [indiscernible] simply by accelerating resolution of just one of their major incidents and avoiding loss of revenue. This customer started with infrastructure, APM and log management, with the opportunity to expand and to more usage in products as the company scales. Next, we had a six figure land with a Fortune 500 logistics company. Three years ago, this customer chose legacy monitoring providers and homegrown solutions over Datadog. Now our platform has come a long way since then. Meanwhile, incumbents were unable to meet these customers' needs, particularly around their communities adoption, leading to dozens of high-profile incidents a year with a high time to resolution. Additionally, these customer expects to save nearly $3 million in developer resources by consolidating multiple products with Datadog. Finally, we had a six figure land with a gaming division at hyperscaler. Previously, this company was primarily using open source and its own hyperscaler native tooling. But despite deep technical expertise, homegrown solutions were lacking granularity and consumed critical engineering resources. By using Datadog, this customer unlocked a prescriptive way to visualize alert and maintain the cloud gaming services. In addition to these wins, we also had a number of sizable six and seven figure new logo and expansion wins with companies that have recently experienced business contraction and announced staff reductions. These customers are looking to streamline their operations, save on engineering costs or consolidate multiple vendors on the strategic platform. We believe that software is a deflationary force and we are confident in our ability to help our customers do more with less, should economic conditions worsen. And these were this quarter's customer highlights, I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their efforts and continued execution. Now let me speak to our longer-term outlook. We recognize the macro environment is uncertain as we look into the back half of 2022. But we also see no change to the long-term trends towards cloud-based services and modern DevOps environments, and Observability remains critical to that journey. We continue to drive market leadership and for our customer's value, efficiency and cost savings to solve their complex monitoring problems. As a result, we continue to feel very confident in our opportunities. We believe cloud migration and digital transformation are drivers of our long-term growth and our multiyear trends that are still early in their life cycle. And we believe it is increasingly critical for companies to embark on these journeys in order to move faster, serve their customers better and in times like these become more efficient with their infrastructure and engineering investments. So we plan to continue to invest in our solid priorities to execute on these long-term opportunities. At the same time, we will continue to closely monitor the demand environment and we'll calibrate further, if necessary, to balance our long-term investments with financial strength. Before I hand it over to David, I wanted to make a couple of announcements. First, we are holding Dash 2022, our user conference on October 18 and 19 at the Javits Center in New York City. This is an occasion for us to showcase our latest product innovations and we're excited to show the one that we've been up to. We also will organize an investor meeting at Dash and we'll share more details on it shortly. And last but not least, we are pleased to welcome Titi Cole to our Board of Directors. Titi is CEO of Legacy Franchises at Citigroup and brings over 25 years of experience in senior global leadership roles in the financial services industry. The perspective and experience will be incredibly valuable as we continue to be on scale. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David? Okay. So I'll start maybe with the linearity. And we did see the viability in usage growth that we mentioned. We saw that start really in late April, May and June. So as we got deeper into the quarter. I should say that this is - if you're thinking of what happened in terms COVID, this is not a sharp pullback as we have seen at that time. But we saw it's just, for some customers still growth, but slower growth for certain types of customers and others than what we would have seen historically. I should say that while we did see that for some of our products, especially the ones that have more of a volume component, net logs and some positive APM, we did see continued healthy growth in host and or I should say, cloud instances and containers, which we're really indicative of the fact that the cloud migration is proceeding as it was before. To fully answer the question also, I think you - maybe are getting ahead of what David is going to talk about a little bit. But in July, we did see an improvement on those trends, but we still remain conservative in our outlook for the short term because of the noisiness of the data we're seeing there. There's a few more valuations, a bit more noise. And all of that is underpinned by some macro uncertainty. So we want to derisk that a little bit and be a bit it more careful. David, do you want to comment on that? That's a great question. So for APM, there's actually part of APM that looks like logs, which is APM is - part of it is host-based and part of it is traffic-based. If you want to run analytics and have longer retention on certain parts of your APM data, it basically behaves like logs. And that's the part on which we've seen some slower growth. It's still growing, but both are actually still growing healthily, but I would say, slower than they were in recent quarters for these types of customers. And you can do the same thing - with this generative data you can show a little bit more, you can reduce retention, these other levers customers have to control the spend there. No, it's just that these are - you have more like short-term levers to actually optimize a little bit in logs and APM, anything that's volume-based. What we've seen customers do is - I mean, really, if we were to cater that customer then we would break them into three buckets. One bucket is the customers that spend a lot with us, have us word to word in their business, now seeing their business slow down. That's what we mentioned in consumer discretionary and for delivery, for example. In those cases, naturally, if customers are themselves are growing 10% to 50%, and they're using several already equivalent to us, they have always been, that's natural. But that's only a small part of our customers. We're very diversified, and we also have a very small part of our customer that uses, to pay us too at this point. The second bucket I would say is customers they have a series he can spend with us. And don't you see a little bit more uncertainty in the future. So their businesses might not be challenged today, but pretty much every CFO or whoever has a mandate to look more closely at their expenses. And what we see those do is they're looking for optimization. They're looking for maybe to find some leaky faucets they can close. And you can typically find some of those in logs, for example. And this is not something new. I mean we've just said before, every customer goes through cycles where they optimize a little bit and then they go again and then they optimize again. What happens in times like that is that you see customers bunched in the same quarter, do we need all at the same time because they're all going through the same macro events. So we're seeing some of that there. And again, this is not comparable in breadth or in magnitude to what we've seen at the beginning of COVID. But still, we see that in the data, so we wanted to call it out on the call. Then the third bucket of... Just to finish it. I had promised three buckets, I'll deliver you the three. The third bucket is customers that are lesser spend, which in this case, we mean less than $500,000 a year on us. They are basically growing as they were before. They're actually growing more slowly than the larger ones. The larger ones have slowed down a little bit while the smaller ones haven't. Yeah. So we're very diversified. So no particular part of the industry actually covers the large part of our revenue. And also, I would say, we - in terms of those of our customers, they are very following in the cloud migration or that cloud native to start with, we actually probably have more of them in consumer discretionary than in other verticals that we have. So that all that came into consideration when we looked at our guidance. Yes. So I'll start on the rapid trends with the hyperscalers and then maybe David can give you more color on the bookings part. So in Q2, we did a lot better than the hyperscalers. So we're growing a lot faster than all of them combined. And they've decelerated actually more than we've done in relative basis. So we actually feel good about the ratio there. Like we are commanding a larger portion of the cloud revenue than we were last quarter. In terms of the go forward, I don't think the hyperscalers have to guide specifically for that. But we - in terms of business trends, we see that all of the leading indicators of success are looking good for us. So I've mentioned it on the call but we're seeing great action with new logos. We're seeing great success with new product attaches. The pipeline's going into the second half of the year are very good. We've also done very well with the capacity we've added and the hiring and everything that's a putting to our future. So all of that is looking good. What we don't have necessarily in terms of the gap for the future is we have a little bit of more noise in the data in terms of growth, which leads us to be a little more conservative. David, do you want to give more color on the booking part of it? And just to be very clear about this, like theoretically, we don't actually manage the business to billings. And that's because it aligns us with our customers. So we manage it to usage, which it turns into revenue pretty directly for us. What this means is we're very heavily - land and expanded. When we land, we typically land small. So that has typically a small impact on billings. And when we expand whether we actually do the expansion this quarter, next quarter that doesn't really matter because it doesn't really change the usage of customers. It doesn't really change their growth profile. It doesn't really change the revenue that we're going to see from them. And so we see some noise there, and we don't manage the business to it. Thank you. Yes. So free is actually the most expensive typically because you have to build it yourself. And it turns out people tend to be the most expensive thing for our customers. We mentioned in the script earlier that we actually had a number of sizable wins with customers that had announced layoffs shortly before they actually bought from us for the first time or have big expansions with us. And that's because we have been more efficient. We have been concentrate their efforts where it actually adds to their business as opposed to reinventing - there were more expensive and efficient way themself. And we're fine with that, by the way. We designed the business that way. We don't offer large discounts for very large time commitments. And that, again, that's by design, like we actually want to align or success with the [indiscernible]our customers, and we're happy to keep it that way. In times like that, it always play down. It's possible. Everything is open. We've looked at some of those in the past. We see the value is higher for larger businesses like that. But we're really looking at valuations coming down and some more opportunities presenting themselves to us there. So everything is possible. But in general, we're very active on the M&A side. I think we'll only be more active as markets temporarily are right now. But there's not much more I can say. So right now, we're aggressively recruiting. We're building capacity. We're successful at it. And I really see it as a predictor of future success. We're in an interesting situation because -- as a company, we are very efficient. We've been very disciplined from the funding of the company. For those of you who have followed us for a long time, we burned less than $30 million on our way to IPO, and we've generated a lot more cash than that since then. So discipline is getting into the DNA of the company. We also built the business around model that is frictionless and extremely efficient. And we've shown this efficiency, I would say, over the past two quarters by growing very fast while being fairly profitable. So we - there's no doubt in our minds about the long-term profitability profile of the company. So what this does is that it affords us opportunities to invest in times like this, that the rest of the market will not have. Last year, everybody could invest, everybody could spend money, it really didn't matter. This year, I think it's a little bit different. So we really see that as an opportunity to break from the back even further and innovate, build self capacity and all those things. Now obviously, as I said earlier, discipline is in the DNA of the company. So we're always looking at what our margins are or the macro environment is. And we have all the levers we need to adjust so we can maintain profitability in the future. David, do you want to comment some more? Yes. The last thing I'd say we feel great about the opportunity in general. We feel great about the -- as I mentioned earlier, the leading indicators of success whether it's new logos, product attaches, or product pipeline, our ability to ship it as well as the pipeline we see of customers that are in sales processes with us for new products or just brand new deployments. So we feel great about all that. And this makes us very confident into our investments. What's possible though is that the demand environment is a bit more challenged. There will be a bit of a longer time for us to show around these investments, but we are fine with that. One way to see, it is - we're critical to our customers. We're critically important, we deliver value. We have them to be more efficient. So in general, and whether -- whatever the size of the customer is, we're not on the chopping block. But the more customers spend on us, they're going to look for savings where they're spending money, and they're going to see that at a larger levels of spend with us. And as we mentioned earlier, there's always a little bit you can optimize, especially with some of the volume-based product. So we - were actually very optimistic from our conversion with customers because there's more and more of them. They want to buy more product. They want to use more of our products. They want to -- so it'd be a problem for them. Everybody wants a better deal, but I think that's always been true, and that's always going to be true. And it's even truer in situations like this where the CFOs have a mandate to be more conservative. So -- but anecdotally, from what we see with customers, we're very bullish. So we keep seeing more and more of it. It's still not the majority of what we do. But we think, again, if the -- there is prolonged macro issues in the market, like we might see more consolidation and customers now want to really try to save on their legacy software by consolidating on us. So we definitely see that as a possibility. Again, that's not the majority of what we do today. That's not what we base any of our projections on, but that's something that we think might happen. They have the same exposure but simply the difference is, what's your time to say, $5,000. Probably not. If you're a much larger customer, it's worth your time to sell $500,000. And that's what we see with those optimizations. It's just mechanicals because we - I think we said 75% of our new logos are landing with two more products, and we have more new logos. And so this pushes the number down a little bit. It's just focused on their cost structure. So they line up their expenses by decreasing in decreasing order and they heat up everyone at least and they see what they can do to optimize. And again, a number -- you've seen a number of customers that had layoffs. So they're going after their cost structure. Their hard core cost structures that are there -- their workforce and we're part of that. I think that it's a good thing because those customers -- and a lot of us were very critical, one of their top vendors. That means, for those of them who use us both will, like we are, to a certain extent, tied to their own trajectory. No, I'm saying let's focusing what they're spending money on. And for some of those, they're spending a lot of money. They're spending more money on cloud in there. I guarantee you, they're also trying to save money on that. And we know that the cloud providers are also working with these customers helping with their spend. I think everybody is aligning trying to make their customers successful there. And we actually have been involved in efforts where we work with the cloud providers and these customers to help them make the most of what they have. And again, in times like this, we want to be on the side of our customers. We want to help them. We want to have them get the most of what they spend on us. so we can have a long-term successful relationship with them. I think the improvements in July were not about closing contracts. The one I mentioned were about the usage trends, which is fairly quite a selling force from the closings and the contracts and everything else. We also -- again, a great pipeline, and we're very happy with what we've seen sell side in July, but this is where -- which we commented about the usage. Usage actually is revenue in the same period. Like it's two others are one and the same. There's no delay between those two. But there's a delay - we were - now there was billings. All right. Thank you. I want to thank everyone for spending time with us on the call. And again, I want to thank all of Datadog employees for a great quarter and for continuing build a fantastic company and so proud of our customers. So thank you all, and we'll see you next quarter."

            "name": "David Obstler",
            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. We delivered strong financial performance in Q2. Revenue was $406 million, up 74% year-over-year and up 12% quarter-over-quarter. As Olivier described, we executed strongly with robust new logo ARR growth, continued low churn and continued strong platform traction. But we did see some customers beginning to manage costs in response to macroeconomic concerns, which impacted our usage growth with some of our existing customers. Looking at our growth with existing customers, our dollar-based net retention was above 130% for the 20th consecutive quarter, remaining strong as we continue to see customers use more existing products and adopt new products on the Datadog platform. We saw usage growth with some existing customers decelerate in Q2 and that deceleration was concentrated in our larger spending customers as opposed to our lesser spending customers, where growth remained steady year-over-year. Amongst our industries, we saw relative deceleration in consumer discretionary customers, which represents low teens percent of our ARR. As a reminder, we are highly diversified in industries and segments. And we saw lower expansion rate weighted towards areas of our platform that have volume-based components like certain aspects of log management and APM. Infrastructure monitoring ARR growth was relatively steady year-over-year. On the other hand, our gross retention remained unchanged and steady in the mid- to high 90s. We believe that our gross retention has reached and is sustaining these levels because of the stickiness of our product and the criticality of our platform to our clients. And as Oli mentioned, our new logos, we saw strong continued new logo acquisition and ARR growth, broadly by geography and across industries and company sizes. Finally, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 79% of our customers now using two or more products, 37% using four or more products, and 14% using six or more products in the Datadog platform as of the end of Q2. Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $397 million, up 47% year-over-year. As in previous quarters, we had some differences in the timing of billings of a few large customers, which were built in Q2 last year but were billed in Q1 this year. And pro forma for those adjustments, billings growth year-over-year was in the mid-50s. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $881 million, up 51% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the mid-50s year-over-year, and contract duration was slightly lower than the year ago quarter. In addition, we observed that some customers aren't changing their level of usage growth but are being more conservative in their commitments, which impacts billings and RPO growth but not revenue growth. As we said in previous quarters, billings and RPO growth can fluctuate significantly and vary from revenue growth, whether higher or lower due to the timing of invoicing and duration of customer contracts. To illustrate this, we note that billings growth for the first half of the year of 2022 was 72% year-over-year. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP, and we have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $328 million, representing a gross margin of 81%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and 76% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of sales this quarter. In the medium to long term, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the high 70s range. Given our success in increasing our investments in R&D and go-to-market, our non-GAAP Q2 OpEx grew 65% year-over-year versus 56% year-over-year in Q1. This included our return to in-person office travel and events, which contributed $11 million to the sequential growth of OpEx. Operating income in Q2 was $85 million or 21% operating margin compared to operating income of $31 million or 13% operating margin in the year ago quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $73 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $60 million with a free cash flow margin of 15%. Our free cash flow margin in the first half of 2022 was 25%. Now for our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2022. First, informing our guidance, we are using conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of customers. Taking into account the macroeconomic uncertainty and recent variability of the growth among certain customers. As Olivier mentioned, we see healthy trends in the host and containers monitored and strong execution in our business, but we recognize customers may have less visibility into their own businesses due to the macroeconomic environment. So for the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $410 million to $414 million, which represents 52% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $51 million to $55 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.15 to $0.17 per share range based on approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.63 billion, which represents 57% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $255 million to $275 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.81 per share based on approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now as regards to our margin guidance, I wanted to point out. First, gross margins have recently been at the top of our historical range. In operating expense, we have returned to in-office attendance, travel and events. We estimate that this was a 300 basis point sequential margin impact in Q2, and we expect an additional 100 basis point sequential margin impact in Q3. As Oli mentioned, in Q4, we will hold our Dash user conference and we will participate in the AWS re:Invent, our largest trade show at the end of the year. The cost of these events will be approximately 400 basis points of margin impact. We're back to fully in-person events this year, and we're excited to get in front of customers and showcase our many product innovations. Next, we have been successful in making R&D and sales and marketing investments, and we believe these will pay off in the future. While we plan to continue to invest, we will remain judicious and disciplined in our cost structure given macro uncertainties. As indicated by the guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins in the second half of 2022 to be in the low double digits. We are healthily profitable on a non-GAAP basis and our free cash flow generative. And we have built a highly efficient, frictionless business model while driving high ROI on our investments over time. Our efficiency and financial strength affords us options in times of macro uncertainty that other market participants will not have, and we intend to make the best of this opportunity to drive our long-term growth. But of course, we are mindful of the environment and are closely monitoring our costs carefully, and we will calibrate further, if necessary, to maintain our financial strength. In conclusion, while we recognize there is greater uncertainty in the macro environment right now, we see no change in the importance of cloud migration and digital transformation, which are critical to our customers' competitive advantage. We believe we are well positioned to help our customers embark on these journeys, and we are investing aggressively into our long-term opportunities while maintaining our financial strength. I want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yeah. On guidance, as you know, we have always been conservative in our guidance by using lower organic growth and other metrics than we've seen historically and continue to maintain that philosophy. I would note that if you look at the raise here and the percentage of the beat that was passed through into the raise from Q2, it is lower, more conservative than we have done in previous quarters. And the reason for that is the macro uncertainty where we can't be as confident about what happens given the macro uncertainty. So I would say there, if you want to take that, there were some incremental conservatism put into this. But I'd remind everybody that we've always been quite conservative in using assumptions that are lower than the past when we give guidance. Just want to clarify, when - if you look after the call on our website, you'll see that in APM it's host-based pricing, but there's other parts that are like logs, as Oli mentioned, that are data related that are related to ingestion and indexing. And so what we're saying is that the infrastructure part, both with the infrastructure and the APM didn't experience as much variability, but the ability to tweak the use of the data through both ingestion and indexing which is more of a part of logs, but also a part of APM was where we saw that variability. Definitely. So remind everybody that with our land and expand where we start getting used by clients, they scale up the growth and when they get to a certain point through, this has been going on for the whole business model. They go to an increased commit. Because of that, there's variability in the billings and RPO that net-net, over time, on average, go towards the ARR growth. Again, remember, we mentioned that the ARR growth is the best metric. And the way to look at that is that you look at the revenues. You take - you use the linearity, which is 34%, 35% of that and multiply that times 12, and that is pure because it doesn't get altered by when a bill goes out either in timing or whether the bill is a previous commitment plus an on-demand or a new commitment. So it's always going to be noisy with us. We understand that investors and analysts look at it. So we try to give some color on that, but remind everybody that, that is very variable and only over time gets -- it comes back to the revenue growth, so just to remind everybody. And I think we said we basically put in there that in the first half of the year, the growth of this was in the 70s, pretty close to revenues. Why? Because there were timing of billing in the first quarter relative to the second quarter that moved the first quarter up and the second quarter down, but it really doesn't have much effect on the drivers of our business. Yes, we haven't seen - yes, thanks for the question. We haven't seen any change in those numbers. We still have the land, commit, use, grow, we get into on-demand, recommit, but we did say that in the level of conservatism that was introduced to some clients that they may have stayed more into their previous commit plus on demand. Because of that, that doesn't for that situation affect the revenues because they're still consuming the same, but they may want to retain more optionality. This is really sort of in looking at financial management with level of uncertainty. You generally would pay a higher price if you stayed that way, but you'd be trading off the higher unit price, the marginally higher unit price for the more optionality. And we did see some of that. We don't know what's going to happen next, but we would think that if we continue to have macro uncertainty, there will be some customers that will opt for that type of pattern relative to the commitments. Yes, to take the second part, I think we saw that in our smaller customers, we had very consistent net and gross retention. We always do that. So our guidance always takes the drivers, which would be the organic or usage growth and the new logos, it always takes it down. So we do that in every quarter. I think you know that from following us. And in this quarter, I mentioned that by passing through less of the beat we inject an incremental level of conservatism. But overall, the philosophy of basically taking all of those things down and it remains at the core of our philosophy of providing guidance. There was not. We did not see that. It was not geographic. As we mentioned, it tended to be more either large spend or industry based, but we did not see that geographically. Yes. I just want to add that what we said all along was, we try to maintain a steady investment profile, which is focused on R&D and sales and marketing investments. And it's banded by what we can execute, what we feel we can hire, integrate, et cetera. And in periods where there are -- is an acceleration, we said this many times on the top line, we can't invest as fast as that when the top line went up to 80%. So you're going to have margin expansion. That was exaggerated because there were some costs that didn't happen in COVID that are part of our normal business operations. So we try to maintain a steady profile of investment and the variability is with this acceleration of the top line, you might see that because it flows through at such a high marginal rate. And then if you see a deceleration, you might see less of that margin expansion. So that's our philosophy, but it's always to invest and take advantage of the long-term opportunity. Yes, not an inversion. I think what we said was -- we did not see what you're saying, which is SMB and smaller customers did not act differently than they had. What we said was whether it's an enterprise mid-market or SMB, what happened was in certain segments, consumer, et cetera, we had a more conservative or a more of a cost mentality. And two, regardless of where it was -- remember SMB for us is 1,000 employees or less, mid-market 1,000 to 5,000, enterprise 5,000 and up. That in the larger areas where there had been substantial expansion, we saw a look at that costs. So those were the determinations. And for us it wasn't Europe, it wasn't that SMB fell out. It was those things. And in terms of the second half of the year, we don't know. But in what we guide always, we assume lower organic growth in all the sectors than we have historically and that we might expect. So I think inversion is the wrong thing because what this -- what happened was the driver of the cost look was not whether it was an SMB mid-market or enterprise, but what the level of spend and the industry. And by the way, gross retention stayed the same at all the different levels, SMB, mid-market and enterprise. So when you're talking about, do you have the solution, are you continuing to do solution, we saw no change in the gross retention across all of our customer sizes. There's nothing, you know, 81%, 79% these are all just - there's nothing, no change in trend. Now given the stickiness and what we did - just monitoring of real-time application for their clients, we feel that and our experience has been that it is less focused on other things than Datadog, but when you're looking at your cost structure, there are opportunities, as you said, to rationalize across. But generally, if you look at the gross retention, you look at how important Datadog is to the businesses. And you read the newspapers, you see that it's focused on other things more. Yes, like they're always -- I think it's been on calls over time. Every call, if there is some timing differences to the positive, billing was in this quarter. We try to point it out because when the bill goes out or when the commitment is not -- is not as correlated to the revenues as ARR is. So we - I think we said that on every - almost every earnings call, and we just remind everybody all the time that because of the land-expand model that you're going to have variability plus and minus. And when it's plus, we want to remind everybody not to read anything into it. And when it's less, we want to remind everybody that that's not the major metric that drives top line growth of the company. Yes. But we're making marginal, yes, we're telling you that we're telling - saying that unlike in COVID there was -- that we had strong usage growth. We had usage growth in a lot of places and on average, in the second quarter. What we're saying is that in July, we saw pockets where there was a little better usage growth, but we're not calling the market here. We're basically reporting what we see and what we hope is the most helpful in a formative way. So yes..."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'll start by saying that we are pleased with our execution in Q1 as we continue to drive high revenue growth, along with strong profitability and strong cash generation.  To quickly summarize our Q1 financial performance, revenue was $363 million an increase of 83% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 19,800 customers, up from about 15,200 in the year ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,250 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,406 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. We are seeing strong efficiencies in our business model with free cash flow of $130 million and free cash flow margin of 36%. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. At a high level, we saw positive business trends in Q1. Usage growth from existing customers was strong and consistent with historical trends as customers continued on their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, and the Datadog platform continued to expand and deliver more value. New logo ARR was very robust and churn remained low and in line with historical rates. All these factors together led to another strong quarter of ARR added. It was, in fact, our second best quarter of ARR added beside from Q4 of 2021. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 81% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 75% a year ago. 35% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 25% a year ago. And 12% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 4% last year. We saw strong growth across the products in our platform in Q1. For example, infrastructure monitoring continues to grow at a rapid clip and exceeded 3/4 of a billion dollars in ARR in Q1. Our APM suite and log management products had a strong quarter and are in hyper growth mode. As a reminder, our APM suite includes core APM, synthetic studies on monitoring and continues on hire.  We're also very pleased with the growth of our user experience product, which are synthetic and relays our monitoring more specifically. These products together exceeded $100 million in ARR in Q1. And in security, we are seeing very rapid growth. It's still early days, and we're growing off a smaller base, but we continue to see strong adoption with thousands of customers getting security coverage through the Datadog platform. Now let's move on to products and R&D, where our teams delivered another strong quarter of innovation. Just 12 months after we acquired Sqreen, we are pleased to announce the general availability of application security monitoring last week. Some applications and APIs are some of the most common sources of data breaching, yet companies typically have no ways to effectively detect attacks, so they could be less than good for days or weeks. Some other approaches to application security aim to find vulnerability before code is production. But these solutions offer and slow down development cycles and overwhelm teams with force positives with no easy way to prioritize these issues. The Datadog Application Security Monitoring product leverages the full execution context of applications running in production. This allows teams to focus on attacks that actually matter and provides an immediately actionable remediation path. Application security monitoring is the 14th product in the Datadog platform, and this is the fourth product within our Cloud Security platform alongside Cloud Team, Cloud Workload Security and Cloud Security Posture Management. With this, Datadog now provides security insights across metrics, traces and logs, and we consider these altogether as version 1 of our Cloud Security platform. Remember that we are still in early stages with our security efforts and have much to do to further build out this product, but we are pleased with our progress so far and the usage we are getting from our customers. Last month, we also announced that we expanded our Watchdog AI capabilities to include root cause analysis and log anomalies detection. Root cause analysis automatically identifies cause of relationships between different systems across infrastructure and services -- sorry, across infrastructure and services, and pinpoints their root causes. Watchdog also automatically identifies the business impact of any given issue using data from our reuse of monitoring products. This means not only identifying which mobile applications are impacted, but also the exact users that are affected. This new capability often solves in minutes, the problem that would otherwise take hours by a specialist in customers' organizations. Log Anomaly Detection on the other hand automatically understands and baselines normal patterns in logs and proactively discovers anomalies such as new patterns, meaningful changes in negative patterns and other outliers. By surfacing these unusual log patterns, Log Anomaly Detection have things fine and fix issues faster.  In addition to this Watchdog announcement, our engineers released dozens of features and expanded product capabilities in Q1. To give a couple of examples, in Real User Monitoring, we announced the general availability of iOS crash reports and error tracking, as well as a number of improvements to help customers analyze and understand the users\u2019 performance. In Cloud Security Posture management, we added support for the Azure platform, enabling customers to understand their compliance posture across AWS and Azure in one place. In Continuous Profiler, we now support all commonly used languages, including C, C++, RUST, PHP and .Net. And across Datadog, numerous addition of rules, data sources and integrations are enabling our customers to solve their problems from end to end without leaving the Datadog platform. Finally, this morning, we announced that we signed an agreement to Hdiv. Hdiv is an application security product, which provides a highly accurate vulnerability detection at runtime. It offers interactive application security testing capabilities, which tie vulnerabilities to exact file and line numbers in the code. And unlike other solutions in this area, Hdiv\u2019s rate of false positive is very low, enabling customers to focus on vulnerabilities that actually matter. We believe Hdiv\u2019s capabilities and strong team will be an excellent part of our Cloud Security platform, and we're looking forward to integrating the capability into Datadog as soon as this acquisition closes when regulatory requirements are met. I will switch to our product update this quarter. I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their continued hard work. There are so many new features coming up, and I can only highlight a few of them in this call. Now moving on to sales and marketing, our sales team continued to execute and have delivered a strong quarter. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q1. First, we signed an 8-figure upsell with a next-gen fintech company which was our largest ever deal on an ARR basis. This customer is experiencing explosive growth in demand for its products, and availability and performance of their system is critical to avoid loss of revenue. These customers started with us 3 years ago with just infrastructure monitoring, and its expansion now includes 6 of our products. Next, we had a high 6-figure upsell with a global shipping company. This customer is expanding with Datadog to help them move forward with their Azure migration. In addition to using 5 Datadog products, they are now working with our new services team to help implement best practices on a number of business initiatives that involve increased Datadog adoption. This customer expects to consolidate 10 disparate monitoring tools as they expand their use of Datadog. Next, we had a 7-figure upsell with a U.S. federal entity. We were able to deepen our relationship with this customer after we achieved FedRAMP Moderate status. Before Datadog, this customer had siloed infrastructures, applications, networks, database and customer experience monitoring, this caused blind spots and long times to resolution. With this expansion, they are replacing both homegrown and commercial observability tools and are enabling DevSecOps cultures with a visibility across the full stack and a single source of truth. Next, we signed a 7-figure upsell with a leading payment company. Earlier this year, these customer\u2019s open source logging tool went down making them blind, but they were able to regain visibility by getting Datadog Log Management up and running within a few hours of that crash. Not only did this customer regained log visibility very quickly, they were also able to use the Datadog platform to scrub personally identifiable information to meet security and compliance requirements. And as they have expanded with Datadog, they have been able to cut the number of engineers who maintain homegrown and print solutions in-house and reassign engineers to other products of work in the organization. With this renewal, this customer now uses 13 products from Datadog. Next, we had a 6 figure land with a major U.S. hotel company. This company lost half of its engineering team during COVID and needed to use its staff more efficiently. At the same time, it was embarking on an AWS Migration and its existing tools were not providing the visibility it needed. By consolidating Datadog, this customer expects to future-proof its cloud strategy and move towards unified end-to-end management across their on-prem and AWS environment. And finally, we had a 7-figure land with a major European car manufacturer. This customer was frustrated with its existing monitoring tools, which left them with limited visibility into incidents sometimes impacting millions of users globally. As they were trialing Datadog, they were able to solve within minutes issue that used to take them days. With Datadog, this customer expects to consolidate multiple commercial and open source tools across AWS and on-prem stacks. That's it for this quarter's highlights. I want to thank our go-to-market teams for their hard work in delivering a strong start to 2022 after a very busy end of the year. I also want to give a special shout-out to our tech solutions and support teams for making our customers successful and enabling them to expand with our own platform. Moving on, we feel very good about the demand environment. And as we look over the medium and long term, our outlook hasn't changed. We remain confident that cloud migration and digital transformation are drivers of our long-term opportunities and our multiyear trends that are still early in their life cycles. We believe it is increasingly critical for companies to embark on these journeys in order to move faster create competitive differentiation, enable strategic change and serve their customers. And we believe we can help customers manage the complexity as it comes with this transformation. And that Datadog unified platform is more than ever critical to understand, improve and secure their modern stacks in businesses. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier, and good morning to everyone. To summarize, we delivered strong financial performance in Q1. Revenue was $363 million, up 83% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Usage growth with our existing customers was strong once again in this quarter. And new logo ARR growth was healthy, particularly given the typical slowness that we see in Q1. Let's go into some more detail. First, growth of existing customers was strong in Q1, and our dollar-based net retention remained above 130% for the 19th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was strong across the Datadog platform and in line with historical trends. We also saw strong ARR growth in each geographical region, and growth was similar across geographies including EMEA. In early Q2, we began shutting off service to customers in Russia and Belarus. We have about 200 customers in these 2 countries and their contributions to revenue is immaterial. Our go-to-market teams delivered another strong quarter. Total customers grew 30% year-over-year and customers with $100,000 or more of ARR grew 60% year-over-year. In addition, we saw strong growth in million-dollar customers. We are pleased to be serving more customers and believe we are still early -- in the early stages of our opportunity in worldwide customer acquisition. New logo ARR was very robust, particularly given that our sales teams participate in sales kick-off and other planning processes at the beginning of Q1. Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately transfer into meaningful revenue. Our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers, with 81% of our customers now using 2 or more products, 35% using 4 or more products, and 12% using 6 or more products at the end of Q1. Finally, churn has remained low. Our dollar-based gross retention rate continues to be in the mid- to high 90s and was stable quarter-to-quarter. And it's similar across our customer segments and major products. Billings were $444 million -- $445 million, up 103% year-over-year. Billings duration in Q1 was similar to the year ago quarter and within the range we've seen historically. We closed several large deals in Q1, including the largest deal by ARR that Olivier discussed earlier, which led to billings growth being higher than revenue growth in Q1. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $858 million, up 85% year-over-year, and contract duration was similar to the year ago quarter. Current RPO growth was in the mid-80s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $292 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% in the last quarter and 77% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the mid- to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range. Operating income was $84 million or a 23% operating margin compared to operating income of $20 million or a 10% margin in the year ago quarter. We are experiencing significant business efficiencies on strong revenue growth. And in Q1, we had not yet returned fully to in-person meetings, events or -- are fully back in the office. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $147 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $130 million with a free cash flow margin of 36%. Now for our outlook for the second quarter in the fiscal year 2022. We remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities. We continue to see cloud migration and digital transformation as trends that are still in relatively early stages, and we are investing aggressively and are successfully executing against these long-term opportunities.  With the usual conservatism applied, our outlook is as follows: For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $376 million to $380 million, which represents 62% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $49 million to $53 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share on an approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.62 billion, which represents 56% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.77 per share on an approximate 349 million weighted average diluted shares. Now some notes on our guidance. First, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions than historical performance. Second, our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for long-term growth. In Q1, we are pleased to have had our best-ever quarter of hiring, and we plan to continue hiring aggressively throughout 2022.  Our North America and EMEA employees returned to the office at the end of Q1, and our APAC employees are returning to office during Q2. In addition, trade shows and other events are picking up in Q2, as is employee travel. In the past, we have framed the benefit of stopping in-person T&E and marketing events during COVID as 300 to 400 basis points of margin impact. We expect our return to office and increased in-person marketing events, as well as our headcount growth to more fully impact margins in Q2 relative to Q1. And even as we embark on these investments and our return from COVID, we remain solidly profitable, as indicated by our guidance. Next, regarding income tax expenses in Q2, we will have a provision of about $3 million related to the Sqreen acquisition as well as our typical provision, mainly related to our international entities. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we are catching up on office build-outs in 2022 and expect CapEx as a percent of sales to roughly double compared to 2021. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in Q1. We continue to attract more customers to the Datadog platform. We are broadening our platform's capabilities and observability and we launched application security monitoring in Q1. We are working very hard to execute against our opportunities, and I want to conclude by thanking Datadogs worldwide for their efforts. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Congrats as well, an amazing first quarter. I wanted to ask a question that I get a lot from investors, Olivier. If you think about your efforts around security, how do you see that playing out in the long run against like the pure-play security players? Is that complementary? Are you kind of moving to same turf? Is it like competition? How do -- how should we think about that? And then second thing is on the ongoing investments into R&D, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about the benefit you're getting from being just a pure cloud provider and hence, your speed of innovation potentially could just move quicker than other players that have to work in on-premise and on the cloud environment?\nOlivier Pomel: On securities, so first of all, the way we see ourselves in the ecosystem is we don't compete with everyone in the field there, like security is very wide. There's many different categories and subcategories in there where we want to play a major role in securing the production, the applications and production environment and all of the life cycles that relate to that in terms of development operations and iterative changes to these environments. So that's where we're starting. We expect to compete with others there. We come from a different place in that we come from having all of the observability data already being deployed end-to-end on those systems and having active users, the integrality of the development and operations teams in these companies, and we think that's what gives us strength there. To the other point you brought up around the speed of iteration, we definitely benefit a lot from being cloud-native and from being SaaS only. We actually get a lot of information about what customers do with our product and how they use it, and we see immediately what's being used not and what's working or not. So that helps us iterate very fast.  We also benefit from having a lot of users. I mentioned that in the first part of my answer, but we're being used every single day by every single developer and house person. That's a lot more than what you see on the typical security products. And so that gives you a lot more information about what you can do and what you can do better. It also gives you more leverage when it comes to actually solving the issues at the secure level. And that's part of the value prop we give to our customers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan : Congratulations on a phenomenal quarter. Maybe I'm curious to get your take on the hyperscalers. And given the broadening product suite that Datadog is undertaking, how are these conversations changing with the hyperscalers? And one for you, David. As the economic environment and the outlook for GDP growth continues to be a little bit wobbly with higher rates, how should we think about the defensibility of the Datadog consumption business?\nOlivier Pomel: So on the question about hyperscalers. So we work hand-in-hand with hyperscalers more and more. So we cover a lot more of the, I would say, the management surface for our customers who are also their customers. We help their customers be more successful and move to the cloud faster. And so as such, we help generate revenue for the hyperscalers, and that's why this partnership works so well with them.  We keep improving on those partnerships and developing them. I think we've announced this quarter some improvements to our Azure partnership, for example, where we are now part of the -- I would say, the Golden Pass presented by Azure for migrating to the cloud. And we're seeing some great customers onboarding, thanks to that.  David, would you like to take the other question?\nDavid Obstler : Sure, thanks, Kash. We believe that digital and cloud projects are still very high priority and are not being deprioritized. We haven't seen that. We think we're still early on. So with the data we have so far, we think there will be continued strong investment. There is always some volatility across our customer base. Our customer base is very well diversified across industries, and we benefited from that over time. So whereas we're not macro forecasters, and there may well be some sensitivity, we believe the long-term trends in digital migration and cloud will still be very strong throughout that cycle.\nOperator: The next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi.\nFatima Boolani : One quick one for you, just as it relates to the deeper strategic and technical penetration within the DevSecOps arena. I mean, it sounds like your thesis is very much because you have the critical massive data and the data gravity as it relates to your observability use cases, you're able to parlay that in a more meaningful way for security. And I'm wondering why not partner with some of your peers in that space versus kind of go at it alone? And then a quick follow-up for David, please.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so that's a good question. So there's 2 things we bring to the table in security. One is we have, as you mentioned, the gravity and we're in the path of data for pretty much everything that relates to our customers infrastructure applications and their own users, which is obviously fantastic.  The other thing we bring is we have -- we're being used all day by everyone in development and in operations. And that's not typically something that the other security products -- or the typical security products are built for. So it's actually hard -- if you wanted to partner, it's hard to find a product that's built for those people. Most security products are purely built for security teams. So that's why we've been building a lot of that.  Of course, we still partner with a lot of the other players in the industry. But we embarked on this journey because we think we have \u2013 we come from a different spot, we think we have different take on the problem that in the end, is -- offers us and our customers a lot more leverage in that an actual chance at solving the 6 day issues, not just throwing software and resources at it. So this is where we come from.\nFatima Boolani : And David, just with respect to that delta between your reported revenue growth in billings, it's probably one of the bigger delta as we've seen in relation to recent quarters. And given your commentary around invoicing duration having stayed pretty stable, I believe that would be -- that would imply 7 to 8 months. I'm still curious as to why you'd see such a meaningful acceleration in billings head and shoulders above revenue growth. If you could just unpack that for us a little bit and when you expect that divergence to narrow?\nDavid Obstler : And I have to -- as I mentioned, there is variability in billing and RPO versus revenue based on when bills go out. We still have, for the most part, in our larger contracts pretty much annual billing. So the sending out of a large annual bill might move the duration a little bit, but not a lot. And the strong performance, the billing was very strong and indicative of the business, it was complemented by the fact that in this quarter, we sent out the bill for some large contracts upfront annual billing and the timing of that causes the variability. Over the average and over the course of the year, that balances out with the timing of the billing, and we believe that billing converges with revenue growth. We remind everybody that revenue growth and implied ARR growth is a better metric of the progress of the business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Olivier, in your script, you mentioned a Fed ramp. I should have brought on kind of another topic that we were sort of hearing about from your partners, which is penetration observability in some of the underpenetrated industries. From your perspective, if you look at the different industries that Datadog participates in, which of the industries do you see can become greater adopters of observability versus some of the kind of traditional technology e-commerce for the --\nOlivier Pomel: Well, look, we've seen pretty much every single industry shows some signs of moving to the cloud already, I think. The order in which this industry has moved really depends on their appetite for being at the leading edge of technology changes and their exposure to interacting with their users online. So what we see -- what we saw first, obviously, was the -- so finance, for example, which is ahead in technology in general, or things like e-commerce, online media, that sort of thing.  Today, we actually see the full range of categories in the industries coming to the cloud. For example, we mentioned an auto manufacturer in our cloud, mentioned in hotel chain. We mentioned in the previous calls, we mentioned plumbing supplies companies, pretty much every single part of the economy is coming there. You're right, though, in your comment that some of those are late to the game than others. And so there's less penetration, I would say, in the more traditional less tech focused -- less tech-focused parts of the industry, but we're confident in everybody is coming to that party.  It's also the case in regulated industries, government, in particular, where not only the moves are a little bit more conservative in terms of technology transitions, but also this part of the industry are also more limited in what they can purchase, which is why it was very important for us to get FedRAMP-certified, which is also why we keep investing in more FedRAMP and more similar certifications, so we can go into more of these categories in more geographies.\nSanjit Singh: And then just 1 follow-up on one of the wins that you guys called out, I think it was a European manufacturer who I think was sort of engineering talent sort of constrained and they moved off of their DIY solution. And so if we take out the topic more broadly, because you\u2019d think that the demand for talent is probably going to get worse. And so in terms of the DIY observability market converting more to, more commercial out-of-the-box value like the Datadog provide, how much of an opportunity do you think that could be for the business?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, I think that's part of our -- it's always been part of opportunity, and that's really what makes the value prop even more attractive in the future. As you correctly pointed out, there's not going to be as many software engineers in general as the market will need. There's not this year, there's not going to be -- I think it's going to be even less the case 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years from now. So what our customers will need is a way for their existing staff to be more productive and a way to direct them to what is actually going to be differentiating for them as opposed to building and differentiated different infrastructure. So we clearly play -- this is a trend that benefits us in the end.  The other thing to bring up is that software in general is deflationary in nature. And that's also the case for us. We help our customers make more with what they have. We have them automate. We have them make people more productive. We help them use their infrastructure better. We help them ship projects that help them interact with their own customers better. So that's where we play.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: David, in your guidance, I know you mentioned you're not really seeing the macro issues, but are you assuming a similar close rate on your pipeline? Are you taking a more conservative close as it relates to the back half of what you're guiding to for the year?\nDavid Obstler : Like all -- as we've talked about, like all of our guidance, we tend to take more conservative close rates, i.e., new logos and more conservative usage than we've experienced historically. So that principle continues with our guidance and is consistent with what we've done in the past.\nBrent Thill: And Olivier, that $10 million upsell, can you just speak to the pipeline of these larger transactions, what you're seeing as your customers expand?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, we see many more customers in that range, right? So customers are riding this adoption curve with us, where we solve the bigger and bigger problem for them, they use more and more of our products. They move more and more of the infrastructure in the cloud to start with, and they themselves are scaling. So these are all multiplayers and increasing our footprint with them. So we have a healthy pipeline of those. We mentioned we handpick a few in every one of those calls, but that's definitely not an isolated case. And that customer is actually in the tens of millions and it's a -- I think a -- again, we don't expect that to be an isolated case.\nDavid Obstler : And I think we mentioned the strong continued growth of $100,000-plus and mentioned, even though we don't give out the 1 million customers every quarter, mentioned continued strong growth in millions. And that's indicative of that. We have many customers who are graduating from smaller lands to the 100,000, the 500,000 class and the 1 million class and above as our model has been all along.\nOperator: The next question comes from comes from Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair.\nKamil Mielczarek: Congrats on the great quarter. A question on pricing, as your largest customer scale and standardize on Datadog, can you talk about how conversations have changed around pricing? And are there any particular modules where you're seeing relatively higher levels of pushback on cost given the rapid growth in data recently and the pricing changes made by some of your competitors in the last 2 years?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so the -- look, any time you -- somebody is paying you tens of millions of dollar a year there's going to be a conversation about price because this is a line item that shows up. Typically, the -- what's going to be the most negotiated as part of that is the biggest part of the deal, which for some customers is infrastructure, for some other is APM, for many customers is logs because that's the 1 where data can grow in a way that's somewhat decorrelated from the size of the company infrastructure or the value of the company applications.  And our approach there really is to give as much flexibility as possible to customers, so they can align with their pay with the value they get. And we've shipped in the past many, many new features around that to give them more tiers for storing data, more ways of doing just in time sampling, archiving, and bringing back data from archives , give them more controls, more levers, and we expect to do more of that in the future.  But it's a very healthy conversation. We do expect that when customers are at fully at scale with us, we get more and more of a wallet share from them. But at the same time, the revenue we get won't grow linearly with the data volumes they send to us. That's natural. That's healthy.\nKamil Mielczarek: And if I could just follow up on free cash flow, generation has been very strong, 36% margin in the quarter, and I think, 28% for last year. How are you thinking about managing free cash flow margin going forward? Is the strength just a function of better-than-expected growth and maybe a tight labor market? Or do you see high 20s, 30% at a sustainable level?\nDavid Obstler : I think we've experienced long-term free cash flow to be slightly higher than EBIT. So correlate it with our EBIT, we have -- it is indicative of the growth of the business. and the efficiency of the business. As we mentioned, we will be returning, we believe, in Q2 to more investments, whether it be marketing events in the office, et cetera. So where we expect it to continue to evidence the efficiency in the business, it would be as it has been correlated to be slightly higher than the EBIT performance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMattHedberg: Oli, I wanted to go back to security. You've obviously had a lot of success there and you're adding Hdiv this quarter. How do you see your sales force evolving over time? And maybe even the thought of a security overlay team at some point?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so we're open to anything there. We haven't made any drastic changes to that. We're still focused right now on getting in front of our existing customers with these products and getting them to adopt the products and writing the maturity of those products with us to make sure they are as broadly as clickable as possible before we accelerate on the go-to-market for them. And we're very happy with where we are. We're exactly where we want to be.  Actually, we get a lot of paying customers with skin in the game and a lot of eyes on the products and a great amount of veracity in terms of development. We are expecting to test a few things on the go-to-market side in the -- I would say, in the coming few quarters, and then we'll see where this leaves us. We see some successes today already with app mobility, and we think it might actually turn a few different things, might accelerate things a little bit, but it's still early to tell.\nMatt Hedberg: And then you guys have always had a very services-light model so easy to use. As you continue to scale up in the G2K, are there additional steps you can do to maybe even enable more synergies within a GSI community?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so there's 2 things we're doing. So one is we're investing in our partnerships with SI and with the channel in general. So we're doing more there. And we also started productizing some service offerings. We actually called one out in one of the customers we released in the call. We have a small services team today that has a few packaged offerings that mostly revolve around accelerating adoption of Datadog and making sure we help customers that need that help, transform their businesses around the way things are running with Datadog. So we're investing on both sides. I mean, obviously, whatever we package ourselves with our own team, will then be scaled through third-party partners, GSIs and others.\nMatt Hedberg: Congrats on the strong Q1.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: You're doing more application security and you've announced some things for observability in developer pipeline. Can you talk about how far you will be going in terms of a shift left towards more of the development side of things, including possibly around static code or source code. And as I said, just that shift left towards developers?\nOlivier Pomel: So that's a great question. We definitely are doing more and more on the shift left and developer side. Obviously, we've talked about security quite a bit, and a big part of that is application security, which is a bit of a known category. So it's there, I think it's a little bit different in how we approach it, a little bit different in the cloud, but the category has been there before.  We're also investing in new categories, and you mentioned the CICD observability. That's a brand-new category. I wasn't there before. And we actually have a product in the market today that we started charging for. And we don't have any numbers to share today, but we are actually very, very pleased with the way this product is being received by customers.  So overall, we think we're going in the right direction there. There will be any more we want to do. I mean you brought up Hdiv, which also brings a bit more around closer to the source code and vulnerability management and things like that. There's more we want to do there, but we don't have anything to announce today.\nMichael Turits: And can I just ask, I think an expansion or take to Matt's question in terms of facilitating your broader product line. Anything in the customer success area that has to be changed or post production engineering or professional services as you have a more broader and more complex offering?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So we're scaling those teams quite a bit, and we're constantly also refining the way those teams are segmented so they can target specific types of customers, and in some situations, not many situations, also setting types of product. So we -- that's part of scaling the teams on the customer success, on the tech solutions, on the support side. So we're investing quite heavily there. I gave those teams a shout out because really, they've been doing a fantastic job at helping our customers scaling about a very broad product portfolio today. And I think there will be more successes to come there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Oli, as the sales force and the marketing team return to face-to-face events, any reason to think that we shouldn't see some level of acceleration in upsells to the larger part of the installed base as well as the potential to land even bigger with new deals?\nOlivier Pomel: It's possible. I mean, look, we definitely have return to investment in some things that we were not doing for the past 2 years that we're doing again in in-person events in particular. I would say it's too early to tell whether it's it gives us an edge again on that side or whether it's just upping the table stakes for everyone for that. But definitely, we're investing with the expectations of returns on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gray Powell with BTIG.\nGray Powell: Congratulations on the strong results. So yes, I mean you've clearly been seeing very good traction moving into larger enterprise and Fortune 500 accounts. How does the competitive environment change there as you move up market? And then do you end up begging off against a different set of vendors? Or just how should we think of that impacting sales cycles?\nOlivier Pomel: So I'm sorry, I'm going to give you the most boring answer ever, but we see no change. The situation there is very much the same as it was last quarter and even last year. We still focus largely on net new and cloud environments. We land fast and small mostly, and we end up growing quite a lot with those customers at the largest enterprises.  Sometimes, but not all the time, we're going to do a big displacement of usually a suite of tools that makes this homegrown and some of the other players in log or APM or infrastructure or all of the above. And these are -- these tend to be the larger lands because they start -- they start larger as they replace a bunch of existing things. But this is still not the majority of the go-to-market and customer acquisition. I think it shows that the product wins about all sorts of situations, but our focus is still on net new and cloud environment.\nGray Powell: And then just -- maybe just a quick follow-up on the security side, if it's okay. Is there anything more you can just say on the road map in the security space, or just like talk about the most natural capabilities that could be included as you start to move into Version 2 of the security platform. And I guess more specifically, and this might be a tough one, but -- do you see a scenario where you could more directly address the endpoint security use case?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, so endpoint, I think, is -- it's not what we have in mind today, right? I mean there's plenty we want to do at the intersection of DevOps production environment applications. Like it's a gigantic problem space and one that's not well handled today. So we definitely are -- have that in our sights today.  In terms of what we can do in the road map, interestingly, there are many things we're doing today that are not branded security that are part of other products that actually play a big role in security. And so one of the questions we have internally, how do we actually draw the line around the security suite versus the rest of the Developed platform in a way that it doesn't confuse everyone.  I mean, for example, we mentioned in the last call, or sensitive data scanner product, which actually is used for security use cases, but it's currently part of our log management product. We have some similar situation with our network monitoring product that also listens to data and uses it for security use cases, but it's not part of our security offering. So there are some branding and packaging and product suite questions that we'll have to answer ourselves there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Koenig with SMBC Nikko.\nSteven Koenig: Congrats on the quarter, it's a pleasure to be covering you guys. I wanted to asked about pricing, again, with kind of a little different angle. And thanks for your color on how you help customers manage their costs as they scale out with Datadog. That's very helpful. If I think about it from a different angle, more from the perspective of how you keep your pricing in check with infrastructure costs as the hyperscalers improve their price performance over time on compute and storage, how does -- you have a relatively simple pricing model in the space, which is a good thing. But I'm wondering, does host-based pricing, do those prices need to change over time as hyperscalers ride their cost curves down? And also in log management as well, as your -- you do have some data charges. And do those need to come down over time as hyperscalers become more price performing. Congrats again on the quarter.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. Well, so there's a few things to consider there. So one is like the type of hosts that our customers buy also is changing over time, that they're also getting larger and larger instances from the cloud providers that costs more and more, even though the price for the same CPU on 2 different years is going to maybe get reduced a little bit by the hyperscalers.  The other factor to consider is that overall, even with all the improvements from the cloud providers and the, I would say, the software industry at large, our customers' experience still a dramatic increase in complexity. And overall, what this means is that a lot of the value gets shifted from actually from running the infrastructure itself to understanding it and managing it, which is what we do.  So in the end, we are in a position where we can maintain or even increase prices while still delivering more value for our customers and selling them more money. So that's the general dynamics here.  Now when you look at the things that are tied to very specific units, so for example, the price per gigabit and things like that, like -- of course, price per gigabyte is going to go down over time in some point. Right now, the form it takes is that there are more and more options that we keep giving our customers so they can do different things with different price points. But in the long run, if you fast forward 20 years, of course, you wouldn't expect to pay the same thing for a gigabyte in 20 years than you do today. But at the same time, I would say you also will have many, many, many others who are managing more data at the time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities.\nJoel Fishbein: Olivier, you spoke a lot about several different potential products in the pipeline as you guys are developing internally. I'm hoping you might give us a little bit more color about the mid- and longer-term plans with regard to maybe areas that you plan to address with new products.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, we have plenty of new products in the works, but for that, you'll have to show up to our events and conferences. We do expect to show more of that in the quarters to come. The areas we're going after, obviously, we're still doubling down on observability. We're early in observability. There's a lot more we can do -- we want to do a lot more that's going to bring value for our customers, and it's a very large market. Obviously, we've been very open about the fact that we're investing massively in security and these costs in particular. So you'll see more from us on that. We also are pushing towards the developer workflows as we had mentioned, with CICD and some aspects of security and some other things that we might show. We're also investing in pushing or extending our user experience products in APM Suite to behavioral and user analytics as well as business analytics. So we keep pushing more and more functionality towards that, and you should expect to see more products from us in that area, which takes us into real-time BI. And then finally, we also are investing in ITSM-minded products started with incident response and incident resolution. And you should expect to see more from us in that area in the future as well. Again, I can't give you any more details. We have a lot of goals in the year right now, a lot of products in flight. We're very bullish about the opportunity. We think -- we see it at a privileged part of the ecosystem where we have such a large surface of contacts, their customers infrastructure, their application, as well as their teams, their developers and their operations teams and other securities that we can solve an increasingly larger problem for them over time while benefiting from frictionless adoption of our platform, which is what year over year gives free cash flow margins that we've talked about today. So again, very bullish, a lot of products and a lot of things we're working on, but nothing more to announce today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Olivier, I just want to start on Hdiv. The acquisition announced today with a vulnerability focus. Could you help us categorize where this competes in the stack? And specifically, are we focused on end point like CrowdStrike with the spotlight product or critical assets like server and data center where VM players like Tenable, Qualys and Rapid7 fit? So where does this fit within the stack and vulnerability and talk about the competitive advantage that they'll bring.\nOlivier Pomel: It focuses on applications. And these are the applications that our customers build as well as the various libraries and dependencies that are brought into the mix as our customers build these applications. So this is -- this will find its right place on the application side of our cloud security platform. We don't have much more to share on the way this will be combined from a product perspective. But we see it as great technology, great product and also great expertise to add to the team and add to our momentum on the security side. And by the way, it did has [Indiscernible] as is often the case with security companies, there are some regulatory approvals to get disclosed.\nAdam Tindle: I know I'm going to be out of time. David, seasonality has just been a constant topic. It seems like since last quarter, I'm sure you're answering a bunch of investor questions intra-quarter about it. And the second half is a little lower as a percent of total than years past based on guidance. Anything for us to consider on seasonality now that you're a $1 billion-plus organization moving forward?\nDavid Obstler: No, it's always been -- it's a similar type of thing where -- the fourth quarter tends to be strong on customer acquisition. We have had, like every company a little slower and new customer acquisition in Q3 that didn't hold last year. It was a very, very strong Q3. And as we mentioned, generally, as you start the year in the first quarter, you have a little bit of slowness in getting going. In this quarter, we didn't have that as much. So it's really the same types of seasonality, which is quite minor relative to the previous years.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll hand the conference back over to CEO, Olivier Pomel, for any closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: All right. Thank you all for attending the call. And I want again to thank all Datadogs and there's many more of you out there, I should remind everyone that we've had our most successful hiring quarter in Q1. So thank you all, and we're all excited to be here, and we'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'll start by saying that we are pleased with our execution in Q1 as we continue to drive high revenue growth, along with strong profitability and strong cash generation.  To quickly summarize our Q1 financial performance, revenue was $363 million an increase of 83% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 19,800 customers, up from about 15,200 in the year ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,250 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,406 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. We are seeing strong efficiencies in our business model with free cash flow of $130 million and free cash flow margin of 36%. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products. At a high level, we saw positive business trends in Q1. Usage growth from existing customers was strong and consistent with historical trends as customers continued on their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, and the Datadog platform continued to expand and deliver more value. New logo ARR was very robust and churn remained low and in line with historical rates. All these factors together led to another strong quarter of ARR added. It was, in fact, our second best quarter of ARR added beside from Q4 of 2021. Next, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 81% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 75% a year ago. 35% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 25% a year ago. And 12% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 4% last year. We saw strong growth across the products in our platform in Q1. For example, infrastructure monitoring continues to grow at a rapid clip and exceeded 3/4 of a billion dollars in ARR in Q1. Our APM suite and log management products had a strong quarter and are in hyper growth mode. As a reminder, our APM suite includes core APM, synthetic studies on monitoring and continues on hire.  We're also very pleased with the growth of our user experience product, which are synthetic and relays our monitoring more specifically. These products together exceeded $100 million in ARR in Q1. And in security, we are seeing very rapid growth. It's still early days, and we're growing off a smaller base, but we continue to see strong adoption with thousands of customers getting security coverage through the Datadog platform. Now let's move on to products and R&D, where our teams delivered another strong quarter of innovation. Just 12 months after we acquired Sqreen, we are pleased to announce the general availability of application security monitoring last week. Some applications and APIs are some of the most common sources of data breaching, yet companies typically have no ways to effectively detect attacks, so they could be less than good for days or weeks. Some other approaches to application security aim to find vulnerability before code is production. But these solutions offer and slow down development cycles and overwhelm teams with force positives with no easy way to prioritize these issues. The Datadog Application Security Monitoring product leverages the full execution context of applications running in production. This allows teams to focus on attacks that actually matter and provides an immediately actionable remediation path. Application security monitoring is the 14th product in the Datadog platform, and this is the fourth product within our Cloud Security platform alongside Cloud Team, Cloud Workload Security and Cloud Security Posture Management. With this, Datadog now provides security insights across metrics, traces and logs, and we consider these altogether as version 1 of our Cloud Security platform. Remember that we are still in early stages with our security efforts and have much to do to further build out this product, but we are pleased with our progress so far and the usage we are getting from our customers. Last month, we also announced that we expanded our Watchdog AI capabilities to include root cause analysis and log anomalies detection. Root cause analysis automatically identifies cause of relationships between different systems across infrastructure and services -- sorry, across infrastructure and services, and pinpoints their root causes. Watchdog also automatically identifies the business impact of any given issue using data from our reuse of monitoring products. This means not only identifying which mobile applications are impacted, but also the exact users that are affected. This new capability often solves in minutes, the problem that would otherwise take hours by a specialist in customers' organizations. Log Anomaly Detection on the other hand automatically understands and baselines normal patterns in logs and proactively discovers anomalies such as new patterns, meaningful changes in negative patterns and other outliers. By surfacing these unusual log patterns, Log Anomaly Detection have things fine and fix issues faster.  In addition to this Watchdog announcement, our engineers released dozens of features and expanded product capabilities in Q1. To give a couple of examples, in Real User Monitoring, we announced the general availability of iOS crash reports and error tracking, as well as a number of improvements to help customers analyze and understand the users' performance. In Cloud Security Posture management, we added support for the Azure platform, enabling customers to understand their compliance posture across AWS and Azure in one place. In Continuous Profiler, we now support all commonly used languages, including C, C++, RUST, PHP and .Net. And across Datadog, numerous addition of rules, data sources and integrations are enabling our customers to solve their problems from end to end without leaving the Datadog platform. Finally, this morning, we announced that we signed an agreement to Hdiv. Hdiv is an application security product, which provides a highly accurate vulnerability detection at runtime. It offers interactive application security testing capabilities, which tie vulnerabilities to exact file and line numbers in the code. And unlike other solutions in this area, Hdiv's rate of false positive is very low, enabling customers to focus on vulnerabilities that actually matter. We believe Hdiv's capabilities and strong team will be an excellent part of our Cloud Security platform, and we're looking forward to integrating the capability into Datadog as soon as this acquisition closes when regulatory requirements are met. I will switch to our product update this quarter. I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their continued hard work. There are so many new features coming up, and I can only highlight a few of them in this call. Now moving on to sales and marketing, our sales team continued to execute and have delivered a strong quarter. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q1. First, we signed an 8-figure upsell with a next-gen fintech company which was our largest ever deal on an ARR basis. This customer is experiencing explosive growth in demand for its products, and availability and performance of their system is critical to avoid loss of revenue. These customers started with us 3 years ago with just infrastructure monitoring, and its expansion now includes 6 of our products. Next, we had a high 6-figure upsell with a global shipping company. This customer is expanding with Datadog to help them move forward with their Azure migration. In addition to using 5 Datadog products, they are now working with our new services team to help implement best practices on a number of business initiatives that involve increased Datadog adoption. This customer expects to consolidate 10 disparate monitoring tools as they expand their use of Datadog. Next, we had a 7-figure upsell with a U.S. federal entity. We were able to deepen our relationship with this customer after we achieved FedRAMP Moderate status. Before Datadog, this customer had siloed infrastructures, applications, networks, database and customer experience monitoring, this caused blind spots and long times to resolution. With this expansion, they are replacing both homegrown and commercial observability tools and are enabling DevSecOps cultures with a visibility across the full stack and a single source of truth. Next, we signed a 7-figure upsell with a leading payment company. Earlier this year, these customer's open source logging tool went down making them blind, but they were able to regain visibility by getting Datadog Log Management up and running within a few hours of that crash. Not only did this customer regained log visibility very quickly, they were also able to use the Datadog platform to scrub personally identifiable information to meet security and compliance requirements. And as they have expanded with Datadog, they have been able to cut the number of engineers who maintain homegrown and print solutions in-house and reassign engineers to other products of work in the organization. With this renewal, this customer now uses 13 products from Datadog. Next, we had a 6 figure land with a major U.S. hotel company. This company lost half of its engineering team during COVID and needed to use its staff more efficiently. At the same time, it was embarking on an AWS Migration and its existing tools were not providing the visibility it needed. By consolidating Datadog, this customer expects to future-proof its cloud strategy and move towards unified end-to-end management across their on-prem and AWS environment. And finally, we had a 7-figure land with a major European car manufacturer. This customer was frustrated with its existing monitoring tools, which left them with limited visibility into incidents sometimes impacting millions of users globally. As they were trialing Datadog, they were able to solve within minutes issue that used to take them days. With Datadog, this customer expects to consolidate multiple commercial and open source tools across AWS and on-prem stacks. That's it for this quarter's highlights. I want to thank our go-to-market teams for their hard work in delivering a strong start to 2022 after a very busy end of the year. I also want to give a special shout-out to our tech solutions and support teams for making our customers successful and enabling them to expand with our own platform. Moving on, we feel very good about the demand environment. And as we look over the medium and long term, our outlook hasn't changed. We remain confident that cloud migration and digital transformation are drivers of our long-term opportunities and our multiyear trends that are still early in their life cycles. We believe it is increasingly critical for companies to embark on these journeys in order to move faster create competitive differentiation, enable strategic change and serve their customers. And we believe we can help customers manage the complexity as it comes with this transformation. And that Datadog unified platform is more than ever critical to understand, improve and secure their modern stacks in businesses. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David? On securities, so first of all, the way we see ourselves in the ecosystem is we don't compete with everyone in the field there, like security is very wide. There's many different categories and subcategories in there where we want to play a major role in securing the production, the applications and production environment and all of the life cycles that relate to that in terms of development operations and iterative changes to these environments. So that's where we're starting. We expect to compete with others there. We come from a different place in that we come from having all of the observability data already being deployed end-to-end on those systems and having active users, the integrality of the development and operations teams in these companies, and we think that's what gives us strength there. To the other point you brought up around the speed of iteration, we definitely benefit a lot from being cloud-native and from being SaaS only. We actually get a lot of information about what customers do with our product and how they use it, and we see immediately what's being used not and what's working or not. So that helps us iterate very fast.  We also benefit from having a lot of users. I mentioned that in the first part of my answer, but we're being used every single day by every single developer and house person. That's a lot more than what you see on the typical security products. And so that gives you a lot more information about what you can do and what you can do better. It also gives you more leverage when it comes to actually solving the issues at the secure level. And that's part of the value prop we give to our customers. So on the question about hyperscalers. So we work hand-in-hand with hyperscalers more and more. So we cover a lot more of the, I would say, the management surface for our customers who are also their customers. We help their customers be more successful and move to the cloud faster. And so as such, we help generate revenue for the hyperscalers, and that's why this partnership works so well with them.  We keep improving on those partnerships and developing them. I think we've announced this quarter some improvements to our Azure partnership, for example, where we are now part of the -- I would say, the Golden Pass presented by Azure for migrating to the cloud. And we're seeing some great customers onboarding, thanks to that.  David, would you like to take the other question? Yes, so that's a good question. So there's 2 things we bring to the table in security. One is we have, as you mentioned, the gravity and we're in the path of data for pretty much everything that relates to our customers infrastructure applications and their own users, which is obviously fantastic.  The other thing we bring is we have -- we're being used all day by everyone in development and in operations. And that's not typically something that the other security products -- or the typical security products are built for. So it's actually hard -- if you wanted to partner, it's hard to find a product that's built for those people. Most security products are purely built for security teams. So that's why we've been building a lot of that.  Of course, we still partner with a lot of the other players in the industry. But we embarked on this journey because we think we have \u2013 we come from a different spot, we think we have different take on the problem that in the end, is -- offers us and our customers a lot more leverage in that an actual chance at solving the 6 day issues, not just throwing software and resources at it. So this is where we come from. Well, look, we've seen pretty much every single industry shows some signs of moving to the cloud already, I think. The order in which this industry has moved really depends on their appetite for being at the leading edge of technology changes and their exposure to interacting with their users online. So what we see -- what we saw first, obviously, was the -- so finance, for example, which is ahead in technology in general, or things like e-commerce, online media, that sort of thing.  Today, we actually see the full range of categories in the industries coming to the cloud. For example, we mentioned an auto manufacturer in our cloud, mentioned in hotel chain. We mentioned in the previous calls, we mentioned plumbing supplies companies, pretty much every single part of the economy is coming there. You're right, though, in your comment that some of those are late to the game than others. And so there's less penetration, I would say, in the more traditional less tech focused -- less tech-focused parts of the industry, but we're confident in everybody is coming to that party.  It's also the case in regulated industries, government, in particular, where not only the moves are a little bit more conservative in terms of technology transitions, but also this part of the industry are also more limited in what they can purchase, which is why it was very important for us to get FedRAMP-certified, which is also why we keep investing in more FedRAMP and more similar certifications, so we can go into more of these categories in more geographies. Well, I think that's part of our -- it's always been part of opportunity, and that's really what makes the value prop even more attractive in the future. As you correctly pointed out, there's not going to be as many software engineers in general as the market will need. There's not this year, there's not going to be -- I think it's going to be even less the case 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years from now. So what our customers will need is a way for their existing staff to be more productive and a way to direct them to what is actually going to be differentiating for them as opposed to building and differentiated different infrastructure. So we clearly play -- this is a trend that benefits us in the end.  The other thing to bring up is that software in general is deflationary in nature. And that's also the case for us. We help our customers make more with what they have. We have them automate. We have them make people more productive. We help them use their infrastructure better. We help them ship projects that help them interact with their own customers better. So that's where we play. Well, we see many more customers in that range, right? So customers are riding this adoption curve with us, where we solve the bigger and bigger problem for them, they use more and more of our products. They move more and more of the infrastructure in the cloud to start with, and they themselves are scaling. So these are all multiplayers and increasing our footprint with them. So we have a healthy pipeline of those. We mentioned we handpick a few in every one of those calls, but that's definitely not an isolated case. And that customer is actually in the tens of millions and it's a -- I think a -- again, we don't expect that to be an isolated case. Yes, so the -- look, any time you -- somebody is paying you tens of millions of dollar a year there's going to be a conversation about price because this is a line item that shows up. Typically, the -- what's going to be the most negotiated as part of that is the biggest part of the deal, which for some customers is infrastructure, for some other is APM, for many customers is logs because that's the 1 where data can grow in a way that's somewhat decorrelated from the size of the company infrastructure or the value of the company applications.  And our approach there really is to give as much flexibility as possible to customers, so they can align with their pay with the value they get. And we've shipped in the past many, many new features around that to give them more tiers for storing data, more ways of doing just in time sampling, archiving, and bringing back data from archives , give them more controls, more levers, and we expect to do more of that in the future.  But it's a very healthy conversation. We do expect that when customers are at fully at scale with us, we get more and more of a wallet share from them. But at the same time, the revenue we get won't grow linearly with the data volumes they send to us. That's natural. That's healthy. Yes, so we're open to anything there. We haven't made any drastic changes to that. We're still focused right now on getting in front of our existing customers with these products and getting them to adopt the products and writing the maturity of those products with us to make sure they are as broadly as clickable as possible before we accelerate on the go-to-market for them. And we're very happy with where we are. We're exactly where we want to be.  Actually, we get a lot of paying customers with skin in the game and a lot of eyes on the products and a great amount of veracity in terms of development. We are expecting to test a few things on the go-to-market side in the -- I would say, in the coming few quarters, and then we'll see where this leaves us. We see some successes today already with app mobility, and we think it might actually turn a few different things, might accelerate things a little bit, but it's still early to tell. Yes, so there's 2 things we're doing. So one is we're investing in our partnerships with SI and with the channel in general. So we're doing more there. And we also started productizing some service offerings. We actually called one out in one of the customers we released in the call. We have a small services team today that has a few packaged offerings that mostly revolve around accelerating adoption of Datadog and making sure we help customers that need that help, transform their businesses around the way things are running with Datadog. So we're investing on both sides. I mean, obviously, whatever we package ourselves with our own team, will then be scaled through third-party partners, GSIs and others. So that's a great question. We definitely are doing more and more on the shift left and developer side. Obviously, we've talked about security quite a bit, and a big part of that is application security, which is a bit of a known category. So it's there, I think it's a little bit different in how we approach it, a little bit different in the cloud, but the category has been there before.  We're also investing in new categories, and you mentioned the CICD observability. That's a brand-new category. I wasn't there before. And we actually have a product in the market today that we started charging for. And we don't have any numbers to share today, but we are actually very, very pleased with the way this product is being received by customers.  So overall, we think we're going in the right direction there. There will be any more we want to do. I mean you brought up Hdiv, which also brings a bit more around closer to the source code and vulnerability management and things like that. There's more we want to do there, but we don't have anything to announce today. Yes. So we're scaling those teams quite a bit, and we're constantly also refining the way those teams are segmented so they can target specific types of customers, and in some situations, not many situations, also setting types of product. So we -- that's part of scaling the teams on the customer success, on the tech solutions, on the support side. So we're investing quite heavily there. I gave those teams a shout out because really, they've been doing a fantastic job at helping our customers scaling about a very broad product portfolio today. And I think there will be more successes to come there. It's possible. I mean, look, we definitely have return to investment in some things that we were not doing for the past 2 years that we're doing again in in-person events in particular. I would say it's too early to tell whether it's it gives us an edge again on that side or whether it's just upping the table stakes for everyone for that. But definitely, we're investing with the expectations of returns on that. So I'm sorry, I'm going to give you the most boring answer ever, but we see no change. The situation there is very much the same as it was last quarter and even last year. We still focus largely on net new and cloud environments. We land fast and small mostly, and we end up growing quite a lot with those customers at the largest enterprises.  Sometimes, but not all the time, we're going to do a big displacement of usually a suite of tools that makes this homegrown and some of the other players in log or APM or infrastructure or all of the above. And these are -- these tend to be the larger lands because they start -- they start larger as they replace a bunch of existing things. But this is still not the majority of the go-to-market and customer acquisition. I think it shows that the product wins about all sorts of situations, but our focus is still on net new and cloud environment. Well, so endpoint, I think, is -- it's not what we have in mind today, right? I mean there's plenty we want to do at the intersection of DevOps production environment applications. Like it's a gigantic problem space and one that's not well handled today. So we definitely are -- have that in our sights today.  In terms of what we can do in the road map, interestingly, there are many things we're doing today that are not branded security that are part of other products that actually play a big role in security. And so one of the questions we have internally, how do we actually draw the line around the security suite versus the rest of the Developed platform in a way that it doesn't confuse everyone.  I mean, for example, we mentioned in the last call, or sensitive data scanner product, which actually is used for security use cases, but it's currently part of our log management product. We have some similar situation with our network monitoring product that also listens to data and uses it for security use cases, but it's not part of our security offering. So there are some branding and packaging and product suite questions that we'll have to answer ourselves there. Thank you. Well, so there's a few things to consider there. So one is like the type of hosts that our customers buy also is changing over time, that they're also getting larger and larger instances from the cloud providers that costs more and more, even though the price for the same CPU on 2 different years is going to maybe get reduced a little bit by the hyperscalers.  The other factor to consider is that overall, even with all the improvements from the cloud providers and the, I would say, the software industry at large, our customers' experience still a dramatic increase in complexity. And overall, what this means is that a lot of the value gets shifted from actually from running the infrastructure itself to understanding it and managing it, which is what we do.  So in the end, we are in a position where we can maintain or even increase prices while still delivering more value for our customers and selling them more money. So that's the general dynamics here.  Now when you look at the things that are tied to very specific units, so for example, the price per gigabit and things like that, like -- of course, price per gigabyte is going to go down over time in some point. Right now, the form it takes is that there are more and more options that we keep giving our customers so they can do different things with different price points. But in the long run, if you fast forward 20 years, of course, you wouldn't expect to pay the same thing for a gigabyte in 20 years than you do today. But at the same time, I would say you also will have many, many, many others who are managing more data at the time. Well, we have plenty of new products in the works, but for that, you'll have to show up to our events and conferences. We do expect to show more of that in the quarters to come. The areas we're going after, obviously, we're still doubling down on observability. We're early in observability. There's a lot more we can do -- we want to do a lot more that's going to bring value for our customers, and it's a very large market. Obviously, we've been very open about the fact that we're investing massively in security and these costs in particular. So you'll see more from us on that. We also are pushing towards the developer workflows as we had mentioned, with CICD and some aspects of security and some other things that we might show. We're also investing in pushing or extending our user experience products in APM Suite to behavioral and user analytics as well as business analytics. So we keep pushing more and more functionality towards that, and you should expect to see more products from us in that area, which takes us into real-time BI. And then finally, we also are investing in ITSM-minded products started with incident response and incident resolution. And you should expect to see more from us in that area in the future as well. Again, I can't give you any more details. We have a lot of goals in the year right now, a lot of products in flight. We're very bullish about the opportunity. We think -- we see it at a privileged part of the ecosystem where we have such a large surface of contacts, their customers infrastructure, their application, as well as their teams, their developers and their operations teams and other securities that we can solve an increasingly larger problem for them over time while benefiting from frictionless adoption of our platform, which is what year over year gives free cash flow margins that we've talked about today. So again, very bullish, a lot of products and a lot of things we're working on, but nothing more to announce today. It focuses on applications. And these are the applications that our customers build as well as the various libraries and dependencies that are brought into the mix as our customers build these applications. So this is -- this will find its right place on the application side of our cloud security platform. We don't have much more to share on the way this will be combined from a product perspective. But we see it as great technology, great product and also great expertise to add to the team and add to our momentum on the security side. And by the way, it did has [Indiscernible] as is often the case with security companies, there are some regulatory approvals to get disclosed. All right. Thank you all for attending the call. And I want again to thank all Datadogs and there's many more of you out there, I should remind everyone that we've had our most successful hiring quarter in Q1. So thank you all, and we're all excited to be here, and we'll see you next quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier, and good morning to everyone. To summarize, we delivered strong financial performance in Q1. Revenue was $363 million, up 83% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Usage growth with our existing customers was strong once again in this quarter. And new logo ARR growth was healthy, particularly given the typical slowness that we see in Q1. Let's go into some more detail. First, growth of existing customers was strong in Q1, and our dollar-based net retention remained above 130% for the 19th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was strong across the Datadog platform and in line with historical trends. We also saw strong ARR growth in each geographical region, and growth was similar across geographies including EMEA. In early Q2, we began shutting off service to customers in Russia and Belarus. We have about 200 customers in these 2 countries and their contributions to revenue is immaterial. Our go-to-market teams delivered another strong quarter. Total customers grew 30% year-over-year and customers with $100,000 or more of ARR grew 60% year-over-year. In addition, we saw strong growth in million-dollar customers. We are pleased to be serving more customers and believe we are still early -- in the early stages of our opportunity in worldwide customer acquisition. New logo ARR was very robust, particularly given that our sales teams participate in sales kick-off and other planning processes at the beginning of Q1. Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately transfer into meaningful revenue. Our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers, with 81% of our customers now using 2 or more products, 35% using 4 or more products, and 12% using 6 or more products at the end of Q1. Finally, churn has remained low. Our dollar-based gross retention rate continues to be in the mid- to high 90s and was stable quarter-to-quarter. And it's similar across our customer segments and major products. Billings were $444 million -- $445 million, up 103% year-over-year. Billings duration in Q1 was similar to the year ago quarter and within the range we've seen historically. We closed several large deals in Q1, including the largest deal by ARR that Olivier discussed earlier, which led to billings growth being higher than revenue growth in Q1. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $858 million, up 85% year-over-year, and contract duration was similar to the year ago quarter. Current RPO growth was in the mid-80s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $292 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% in the last quarter and 77% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the mid- to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range. Operating income was $84 million or a 23% operating margin compared to operating income of $20 million or a 10% margin in the year ago quarter. We are experiencing significant business efficiencies on strong revenue growth. And in Q1, we had not yet returned fully to in-person meetings, events or -- are fully back in the office. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $147 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $130 million with a free cash flow margin of 36%. Now for our outlook for the second quarter in the fiscal year 2022. We remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities. We continue to see cloud migration and digital transformation as trends that are still in relatively early stages, and we are investing aggressively and are successfully executing against these long-term opportunities.  With the usual conservatism applied, our outlook is as follows: For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $376 million to $380 million, which represents 62% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $49 million to $53 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share on an approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.62 billion, which represents 56% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.77 per share on an approximate 349 million weighted average diluted shares. Now some notes on our guidance. First, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions than historical performance. Second, our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for long-term growth. In Q1, we are pleased to have had our best-ever quarter of hiring, and we plan to continue hiring aggressively throughout 2022.  Our North America and EMEA employees returned to the office at the end of Q1, and our APAC employees are returning to office during Q2. In addition, trade shows and other events are picking up in Q2, as is employee travel. In the past, we have framed the benefit of stopping in-person T&E and marketing events during COVID as 300 to 400 basis points of margin impact. We expect our return to office and increased in-person marketing events, as well as our headcount growth to more fully impact margins in Q2 relative to Q1. And even as we embark on these investments and our return from COVID, we remain solidly profitable, as indicated by our guidance. Next, regarding income tax expenses in Q2, we will have a provision of about $3 million related to the Sqreen acquisition as well as our typical provision, mainly related to our international entities. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we are catching up on office build-outs in 2022 and expect CapEx as a percent of sales to roughly double compared to 2021. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in Q1. We continue to attract more customers to the Datadog platform. We are broadening our platform's capabilities and observability and we launched application security monitoring in Q1. We are working very hard to execute against our opportunities, and I want to conclude by thanking Datadogs worldwide for their efforts. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Sure, thanks, Kash. We believe that digital and cloud projects are still very high priority and are not being deprioritized. We haven't seen that. We think we're still early on. So with the data we have so far, we think there will be continued strong investment. There is always some volatility across our customer base. Our customer base is very well diversified across industries, and we benefited from that over time. So whereas we're not macro forecasters, and there may well be some sensitivity, we believe the long-term trends in digital migration and cloud will still be very strong throughout that cycle. And I have to -- as I mentioned, there is variability in billing and RPO versus revenue based on when bills go out. We still have, for the most part, in our larger contracts pretty much annual billing. So the sending out of a large annual bill might move the duration a little bit, but not a lot. And the strong performance, the billing was very strong and indicative of the business, it was complemented by the fact that in this quarter, we sent out the bill for some large contracts upfront annual billing and the timing of that causes the variability. Over the average and over the course of the year, that balances out with the timing of the billing, and we believe that billing converges with revenue growth. We remind everybody that revenue growth and implied ARR growth is a better metric of the progress of the business. Like all -- as we've talked about, like all of our guidance, we tend to take more conservative close rates, i.e., new logos and more conservative usage than we've experienced historically. So that principle continues with our guidance and is consistent with what we've done in the past. And I think we mentioned the strong continued growth of $100,000-plus and mentioned, even though we don't give out the 1 million customers every quarter, mentioned continued strong growth in millions. And that's indicative of that. We have many customers who are graduating from smaller lands to the 100,000, the 500,000 class and the 1 million class and above as our model has been all along. I think we've experienced long-term free cash flow to be slightly higher than EBIT. So correlate it with our EBIT, we have -- it is indicative of the growth of the business. and the efficiency of the business. As we mentioned, we will be returning, we believe, in Q2 to more investments, whether it be marketing events in the office, et cetera. So where we expect it to continue to evidence the efficiency in the business, it would be as it has been correlated to be slightly higher than the EBIT performance. No, it's always been -- it's a similar type of thing where -- the fourth quarter tends to be strong on customer acquisition. We have had, like every company a little slower and new customer acquisition in Q3 that didn't hold last year. It was a very, very strong Q3. And as we mentioned, generally, as you start the year in the first quarter, you have a little bit of slowness in getting going. In this quarter, we didn't have that as much. So it's really the same types of seasonality, which is quite minor relative to the previous years."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a good Q4 to end what has been a very productive year to 2023. Throughout the year, we kept innovating at a fast pace, going broader and deeper into the problems we solve for our customers. We also continue to add new customers and expand with existing ones, driving both usage growth and adoption of new products. But most of all, I'm very pleased that we mobilized as a company to help our customers get through a tougher economic environment. We help our customers make more efficient use of their cloud and observability, leaving them in a better position at the end of the year, from which they can focus again on growing their businesses and migrating to the cloud. Now, let me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. Revenue was $590 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 27,300 customers, up from about 23,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 3,190 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,780 last year. These customers generated about 86% of our ARR. We had 396 customers with an ARR of $1 million or more, compared to the 317 we had at the end of last year. And we generated free cash flow of $201 million, with a free cash flow margin of 34%. Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 81% a year ago. 47% of customers were using four or more products, up from 42% a year ago. 22% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 18% a year ago. And as a sign of continued penetration of our platform, 9% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 6% a year ago. And our success with cross-product adoption isn't limited to core observability, as our newer products continue to gain traction. Note, for example, that the ARR for products outside of infrastructure monitoring, APM suite, and log management grew by more than 75% year-over-year. As a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, Synthetics, RUM, and Continuous Profiler. During 2023, we continued to land and expand with larger customers. As of December 2023, 42% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, up from 37% last year. We think many of the largest enterprises are still very early in their journey to the cloud. The median Datadog ARR for Fortune 500 customers is still less than $0.5 million, which leaves a very large opportunity for us to grow with these customers. Now, let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q4, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was similar to Q3. Our usage growth during the quarter played out roughly as expected, including a strong start in October and the slowdown we typically see at the end of December. We also note that the greater intensity of optimization we've seen over the past six quarters appears to have dissipated. For the last couple of quarters, we have discussed with you a cohort of customers who are optimizing. In Q4, this cohort's usage grew at a faster pace than the broader customer base. We take this as a positive sign. To be clear, we see optimization activity with our customers every quarter. We expect them to continuously make sure they are using their cloud efficiently, and we'll keep helping them do that. And we do still see attention to cost in certain parts of our customer base, but overall, we see less headwinds than we did a few quarters ago. Meanwhile, we had a strong bookings quarter in Q4. Our go-to-market teams delivered our largest annualized bookings since Q1 of '22. And our enterprise team in particular executed on a record amount of annualized bookings in Q4. We are also seeing more customers enter into multiyear deals with us, which speaks to our deepening relationships with them, as well as customers planning for growth and for the longer term after a period of optimization and uncertainty. As a reminder, our bookings don't translate immediately into revenue growth, but it is an indicator that we continue to serve our new and existing customers well, and they are growing with us over time. Finally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid-to-high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers. Moving on to R&D, we released over 400 new features and capabilities during 2023. Of course, that's too much for us to cover today, but let me speak to a few. In observability, we now have more than 700 integrations, allowing our customers to benefit from the latest AWS, Azure and GCP capabilities, as well as from the newly emerging AI stack. We continue to see increasing engagement there with the use of our NextGen AI integrations growing 75% sequentially in Q4. In the Generative AI and LLM space, we continue to add capabilities to Bits AI, our natural language incident management copilot, and we are advancing LLM observability to help customers investigate how they can safely deploy and manage their models in production. Today, about 3% of our ARR comes from NextGen AI native customers, but we believe the opportunity is far larger in the future as customers of every industry and every size start deploying AI functionality in production. In the APM space, we launched Data Streams Monitoring to monitor queuing, streaming and event-driven pipelines, which is a technically challenging type of workloads APM products have historically struggled to cover. We also rolled out single-step APM onboarding, allowing a single engineer to enable APM across complex applications in minutes. And with dynamic instrumentation, engineers can add logs, metrics, and traces to their applications on the fly without code changes or redeployment. In the digital experience area, we've added heat maps and scroll maps to our real user monitoring product to show developer and product owners what their users are actually seeing. And our customers can now create synthetic tests directly from Session Replay, for which, we have received very positive feedback. And in log management, we continue to expand our capabilities. Starting with Flex logs, customers can have cost-effective -- very cost-effective way to retain their logs at a very large scale. With error tracking for logs, customers can quickly cut down millions of error lines into a handful of actionable summaries. And our log pipeline scanner allows customers to inspect log events in near real-time, building greater visibility into data quality and data governance. In Cloud Service Management, we made workflow automation generally available, enabling customers to easily automate and orchestrate processes across operations and security. And today, we are announcing the general availability of case management to provide engineers with a single view for investigations, ticketing, to-do items, tasks, and follow-ups across the Datadog platform. Moving on to Cloud Security. We kept executing against an ambitious roadmap and are pleased to know count over 6,000 customers using one or more Datadog Security products. This month, we launched software composition analysis to enable our customers to proactively detect and remediate vulnerabilities before the code gets to production. We announced Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management to help customers prevent identity and access management security issues. We shipped cloud SIEM investigator, so customers can conduct deep security investigation using logs over long periods of time. We simplified security operations with our security inbox to allow our customers to correlate security issues into one single list to investigate and remediate. And we also expanded our data security capabilities. Sensitive Data Scanner now finding secrets and sensitive data in traces and run events, in addition to logs. In Software Delivery, we launched Intelligent Test Runner, which dramatically accelerates the testing process in CI/CD. And we shipped code quality and security gates to enforce best practices, catch security vulnerabilities, and prevent flaky tests. And last, but not least, we delivered on a number of platform-wide initiatives. We launched our latest data center in Japan to help customers comply with local data privacy laws. We opened up CoScreen throughout our platform for collaboration, incident response, [fair] (ph) programming, and debugging. We extended Cloud Cost Management, which is now GA for AWS and Azure and will soon be for GCP, to offer a comprehensive view of costs across our customers' cloud footprint. And we announced our intent to achieve FedRAMP High and Impact Level 5 authorizations. So I'd like to thank our product and engineering teams for a very productive 2023 and I'm super excited with what we have planned for 2024. Let's move on to sales and marketing. First of all, I'd like to welcome Sara Varni to the team, as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Sara brings more than 15 years of marketing experience centered around developers and enterprise software, and we really look forward to her leadership in this pivotal role. As I said earlier, we had a very strong close to 2023 with record levels of bookings and some very exciting new logos and expansions. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed a three-year expansion and our first-ever nine-figure TCV deal with a major global fintech company. This expansion brings us into a major new business unit that we were not deployed in before. And this time, the customer focused on bringing end-to-end observability to their mobile applications and they focus, in particular, on being in front of any user-impacting issues through the use of our Real User Monitoring product. With this renewal, this customer expects to use 15 Datadog products and will consolidate what used to be 10 separate tools, including the replacement of three commercial products across infrastructure monitoring, APM, and RUM. Next, we signed a seven-figure expansion with one of the world's largest restaurant chains. This customer is using AWS, Azure, GCP, and Oracle Cloud and they believe Datadog is the only platform that can deliver a consistent experience across all four clouds. With this expansion, the customer plans to deploy Datadog for Cloud Service Management use cases and will expand to a total of 10 Datadog products. Next, we signed an eight-figure multiyear expansion with a leading European financial services company. This customer is undergoing a large-scale migration to Azure and will expand its use of Datadog across on-prem, private, and public cloud. Today, Datadog is used by 3,000 users every month in over 400 teams to monitor 13,000 hosts. With the migration, the Datadog platform usage will expand to more than 1,000 teams and 50,000 hosts. This customer plans to use 14 Datadog products and consolidate more than 10 legacy open source and cloud monitoring tools. Next, we signed a seven-figure land with one of the world's largest food and consumer goods company. This customer wants to be more proactive with risk mitigation and system resilience as they migrate to Azure. They also want to reduce the thousands of hours of engineering time they spend every year in incident triage. This customer brought in Datadog to be the observability foundation of their AIOps strategy, in particular using Watchdog and our incident management capabilities. This new land includes 17 Datadog products and the customer expects to consolidate at least six commercial observability tools. Finally, we signed a six-figure land deal with one of the largest US utilities. This customer is re-architecting its customer-facing website and re-platforming its customer support experience. They identified Datadog as the only platform that could still easily integrate end-to-end with their existing sales, customer experience, and data workflows. This customer expects to start with six Datadog products and they will displace two commercial observability tools in the process. And that's it for this quarter's highlight. Congrats again to our go-to-market teams for their great work in 2023, an excellent close of the year, and ambitious plans for 2024. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, a few words on our longer-term outlook. During 2023, we continued to execute on our product innovation plans and we solved more problems and delivered more value to customers. As we enter 2024, it appears that the worst of cloud optimization may be behind us. We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business and critical motions for every company to deliver value and competitive advantage. We see AI adoption as an additional driver of investment and accelerator of technical innovation and cloud migration. And more than ever, we feel ideally positioned to achieve our goals and help customers of every size in every industry to transform, innovate, and drive value through technology adoption. With that, I will turn it over to David.\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. Q4 revenue was $590 million, up 26% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of this Q4 performance, first, regarding usage growth. Overall, we saw usage growth from existing customers in Q4 that was similar to what we saw in Q3. Last quarter, we mentioned that the larger and more intense optimizers had begun to show signs of stabilization. In Q4, we saw those trends continue and the large optimizers begin to grow again. While we may still be in a cost-conscious environment overall, we believe that the higher intensity of optimization has dissipated and clients are continuing to invest in new digital applications. For the first time in six quarters, our sequential ARR adds in Q4 were higher than in the year-ago quarter. As we look at early data for Q1, January usage growth was solid. The rebound we're seeing from the slower end of December is better than what we experienced last January. We note as always that it's too early to know how the quarter will play out, and we would caution investors from extrapolating too much, but we're encouraged by the near-term trend. Regarding usage growth by customer size, we experienced our highest growth in our largest and smaller spending customers in this quarter. This includes a record increase in sequential ARR added from customers who spend $1 million or more annually with us, and an expansion of 1 million plus customers from 317 to 396 over 2023. In terms of new logos, our customer additions on a gross and net basis, as well as on a new dollar -- a new logo dollar basis were similar to that of Q3. As before, our net adds including -- included slightly elevated churn in our very long tail of small customers, many of whom are self-service. Geographically, we experienced stronger year-over-year revenue growth in international markets in North America. Our international markets represented 31% of our revenue in Q4 2023, up from 28% in Q4 of last year. Finally, for our retention metrics. Our trailing twelve month net revenue retention was in the mid-110s in Q4. Our trailing 12 month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid to high 90s. And our dollar churn is low and declined sequentially. Now, moving on to our financial results. Billings were $723 million, up 35% year-over-year. Billings duration increased year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.84 billion, up 74% year-over-year. Current RPR growth was in the mid-40s percent year-over-year. We are continuing to see an increasing interest with our larger customers in multiyear commitments, which results in longer RPO duration in both total and current RPO. We welcome the opportunity to have these longer-term strategic partnerships with our clients. And we see that once customers are farther along in their optimizations, they feel comfortable committing over longer periods of time in the future. As we said before, we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now, let's review some of our key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $492 million, representing a gross margin of 83.4%. This compares to a gross margin of 82.3% last quarter and 80.6% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency products -- projects. Our Q4 OpEx grew 10% year-over-year, a decline from 17% year-over-year growth last quarter. As we discussed last quarter, while making meaningful investments in 2023, we were more cautious than in previous years given the macro condition and focused more on efficiency and optimization. We believe this will put us in a good position to accelerate investment in 2024 while maintaining margin discipline. Q4 operating income was $167 million, or a 28% operating margin, up from 24% last quarter and 18% in the year-ago quarter. As with last quarter, our margins ended up being higher than we expected in Q4 as we executed well on our internal optimization and cost management efforts. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $220 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $201 million with a free cash flow margin of 34%. Now for our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2024. Our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $591 million, which represents a 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $128 million to $132 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.33 to $0.35 per share based on approximately 35 -- 357 million of average diluted shares outstanding. For fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.555 billion to $2.575 billion, which represents 21% -- 20% to 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $535 million to $555 million, which implies an operating margin of 21% to 22% and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.44 per share based on 361 million average shares diluted outstanding. Some additional notes on guidance. As it relates to our growth in OpEx and hiring, as I mentioned earlier, we took a more cautious attitude towards hiring during 2023. And our headcount ended fiscal 2023 at about 5,200 people, growing in the high single digits year-over-year. We remain excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities. And as a result, our operating profit guidance reflects our intent to invest for future growth in 2024. We intend to accelerate hiring in R&D to execute on our long-term growth opportunities and in sales and marketing to reach customers worldwide. Because of that, our operating profit guidance implies operating expense growth in the mid-20% range year-over-year, with operating expense year-over-year growth ramping throughout 2024 as we execute on our hiring plans. Meanwhile, we will continue to balance our investments in long-term growth with financial discipline as we have executed in the past. Now turning to other areas of the P&L. First, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Regarding taxes, while we expect to continue to be a modest cash payer in 2024, estimated to be $20 million to $25 million, we are establishing a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in fiscal year 2024 and going forward. And this is reflected in our non-GAAP net income per share guidance. We have recasted our fiscal 2022 and '23 non-GAAP net income to reflect this non-GAAP tax rate, and that is available in the tables in our earnings release as well as the financial supplemental. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range in fiscal year 2024. Now to summarize, we are pleased with our execution in 2023. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys. And we plan to innovate further and expand the set of problems we solve for our customers in 2024 and beyond. I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in 2023, and I'm excited about our plans in 2024. Finally, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Investor Day this Thursday in New York City. Please go to the Datadog IR website for the live stream or contact the IR team at ir@datadoghq.com to attend in person. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the great bookings result to end the year. Oli, as we sort of come out of this sort of down cycle, reflecting the optimization cycle that we've seen for the last several quarters, I was wondering how you think about where the sources of growth are going to come from in terms of your various customer reports? I'm thinking about the digital natives, which drove a lot of growth in 2019, 2020 and '21 versus your enterprise opportunity and your mid-market customers. As we come out -- go into sort of the next cycle, where does that dollar growth do you think comes from for Datadog?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, it's a good question. I would say, pretty much all of the above. I think the -- it's always a little bit hard to time the cycles for specific subsets of the customer base as various macro conditions ripple through the economy [like the assets, various] (ph) different parts of our customer base. We suddenly saw a big slowdown from the digital native over the past year. On the other hand, they might be the first ones to fully leverage AI and deploy it in production. So you might see some reacceleration earlier from some of them at least. If you zoom at a little bit, our focus over the past few years has been on really going to market aggressively on the enterprise, the mid-market, the more traditional side of the world that still has to largely [get us clearly] (ph) to the cloud. We've planted a lot of seeds there with a number of large companies that still have relatively small deployments in the cloud. And our focus over the next couple of years is going to be to grow them and obviously land the ones we still don't have. We mentioned on the call about 42% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, and they're still largely small, like a few hundred thousand dollars a year spent on us. So that's where we direct our efforts.\nSanjit Singh: And I appreciate that thought. And one quick follow-up. When you get customers adopting almost 10% of the base, eight or more products and the number of customers you highlighted in your script had over 10-plus products, how are those deals being structured? Meaning that are they buying sort of individual SKUs at a time and sort of adding them on over time? Or are they being folded into a sort of like a rate card agreement or an enterprise licensing? Just how that pricing and packaging works for customers that get up to that level of adoption.\nOlivier Pomel: So in general, what we do is when we do these larger multiproduct or consolidation deals, we have a specific rate card and customers can have total fund commitment and customers can allocate the funds in real time to the products they need when they them, which, by the way, gives them a lot of flexibility they don't have when they have to manage like five different vendors for different parts of their coverage. There are some exceptions. There are some customers that have such a specific and large volume requirement for one product in particular. Typically, this would be things like logs or maybe metrics and things like that, where they get specific commitments in place around specific products. But in general, most customers have a lot of flexibility when they take these commitments with us. And we'll see -- we'll show some examples also at the Investor Day. I have -- the mix of spend can change over time with customers while we expand and cover more and more of the environment.\nSanjit Singh: Great. Looking forward to it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. And it comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much. David, the billings growth accelerated 5 points. It was also seasonally stronger than a year ago. And just eyeballing the CRPO figure, it's a pretty massive number. Is that strong bookings performance more tied to a small number of mega deals coming from your cloud data? Or did you feel that it was kind of a broader phenomenon across the multiple verticals? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. There's a couple of aspects. First of all, given the sort of renewal cycle, Q4 tends to have more recommitments. So I think if you look back, you'll see that we tend to have nice billings growth. But in terms of where, it really was correlated with larger customers who, as Oli mentioned, are buying a more complete suite of Datadogs. It wasn't cloud native or not cloud native. It was our customers who have standardized on Datadog, have a good sense of their volumes and have committed longer, resulting in a longer average billing and contract duration in Q4 than we have had previously.\nOlivier Pomel: And really we should emphasize that this is really a change of stance of the customer base compared to last year. So last year, customers were in optimization mode. They didn't know what their consumption should look like. They didn't know economically what they were shooting for as businesses. After a year of optimization, a year of examining everything -- I mean, we see customers recommit for much longer periods of time than they did before as they focus on growing and investing. So it's a -- we like the set up a lot more than we did last year from that perspective. And you see that in the billings numbers.\nMark Murphy: Yeah, that's very encouraging. Thank you, Olivier. And just as a follow-up, if you think about the very long term, would you think attach rates of observability will end up being higher or lower for these AI workloads versus traditional workloads? Because on the surface, with AI, it's bringing the risk of hallucinations and bias, your products help to control that. It's also more computationally intensive and there's more value to unlock if the LLM runs reliably and creates that kind of great user experiences. So I'm just wondering how you might think about that attach rate three to five years down the road?\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, we see the attach rate going up. The reason for that is our framework for that is actually in terms of complexity. AI just adds more complexity. You create more things faster without understanding what they do. Meaning, you need -- you shift a lot of the value from building to running, managing and understanding, securing all the other things that need to keep happening after that. So the shape of some of the products might change a little bit because the shape of the software that runs it changed a little bit, which is not different from what happened over the past 10, 15 years. But we think it's going to drive more need for observability, more need for security products around that.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much, and congrats.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. And it's from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo, please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thank you and congrats from me as well. I have two quick questions, first for Olivier and then one for David. Olivier, if I think about some of your customers have some very, very large contracts. But then you talked earlier about like if you look at the average kind of large customer is still relatively small in terms of their spending with you. Can you speak a little bit about difference between one and the other? And then what you can do to kind of change that for those that are not spending as much with you? And then also maybe as part of that, like, is the competitive landscape changing with all the consolidation in the space of some of your larger competitors actually kind of being in a new home now? And then for David, any little more yardstick in terms of like how the timing of the investments play out this year? I know you mentioned a comment that like -- is there more sales and marketing earlier in the year to get the sales guide ramped in the latter part of the year. But -- so how should we think about that modeling? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: So I'll start with the large companies that are still small customers. That's completely due to them being small in the cloud today. And so typically, they have maybe one of their business units, two of their business units in the cloud with some fraction of the applications there. The goal is to have them consolidate on us as they move more into the cloud. So go end-to-end in a specific business unit and then expand to the whole enterprise at the end. So the difference between a customer that, like the ones we mentioned today that signs a nine-figure deal with us and a customer that's still at the low hundreds of thousands of dollars, is that the one that has the fact that large deal has us pretty much wall-to-wall in a significant part of their business and has consolidated a large part of their observability. I should say, the customer that pays us nine figures still hasn't consolidated everything on us with there still more upside to be had, more parts of their businesses, more parts of their coverage we can get. The good news is that all of that business is coming to us as these customers move into the cloud. The bad news is that we don't drive the move to the cloud, right? So in periods where it goes a little bit more slowly than we've seen over the past year, that growth can be a little bit slower. But we are very confident into the fact that this is going to happen. AI is going to accelerate. It's going to make it even more relevant. And that's the trend that's going to stay with us for the next few years. On the competition side, there's no real change. I think I would say very boring from a competitive perspective in that the situation is pretty much the same as it was last quarter and the quarter before. There's definitely opportunity with a number of companies, including one that\u2019s large and has been sold. I'm sure everybody has seen. Because we're not competitors, we were seeing very often on the cloud side of the world already. I think these commuters have retreated a bit more to the traditional on-prem bread and butter but we think it is going to open more opportunity in the midterm, definitely. So that's something we are aware of.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. And on your second question, much of this growth is related to hiring, which takes time to do. We are trying to invest both in quota capacity, in terms of sales as well as in R&D capacity. Our intent is to open the heads earlier in the year in order to try to get return in the near term. But I think you can assume that, that investment will ramp throughout the year because it takes time to get the headcount in. And we gave the guidance for Q1 indicating what we think to happen in Q1.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Congrats.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question And it comes from the line of Ray McDonough with Guggenheim. Please proceed.\nRay McDonough: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first for Oli -- or maybe, David. As you think about the investments you're making to the sales force and your hiring capacities, are there any changes you're making to your go-to-market motion? Are you adding incremental overlay sales forces for security or anything else we should be thinking about in terms of changes to the go-to-market motion?\nOlivier Pomel: There's no change at scale that we\u2019ve done are worth noting on this call. We made a lot of adjustments in the way we say all the time. We make adjustments in the we package our products. For example, we package some of our security products directly into our infrastructure and APM products. We have a new tier called DevSecOps for both APM and infrastructure, and these are great ways for us to actually bring those products into the conversation, make them easier for customers to discover and also make them easier for the sales force to bring up and to sell. And we see we're actually starting to see great success with that. So still very early, obviously, because [indiscernible] last quarter, but we like what we see with those SKUs. More broadly, we're investing in the sales force. We're increasing capacities. We've increased capacity last year, even though it was a slowdown year in the economy and we have plans to increase the capacity again this year. And we think there's plenty more markets for us to be had, both in terms of the -- inside the segments in which we're already very present, but also in a number of new categories -- sorry, new segments of the market, new geographies that we don't cover very well yet.\nRay McDonough: Thanks. Maybe just as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit more about your pipeline construction? Specifically, how are larger opportunities weighted in your pipeline at this point? You talked a lot about more multiyear deals. You talked about kind of the construction of billings and CRPO. But maybe alongside that, can you talk about how long it takes typically to close an opportunity like the nine-figure deal you mentioned? Obviously, your go-to-market motion is more of land and expand motion, but I'm just wondering if as you see larger opportunities in your pipeline, deals may be taking a little longer to close still than typically.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Because of the way we do business, where we try and land fast and small, we expand after that on an ongoing basis. We don't really -- we haven't seen -- even in last year, what's been a tougher year for most sales organizations, we haven't seen an elongation of sales cycles. It remained very, very stable. In general, we always felt that our sales pipelines were very solid. As a CEO, when I start the quarter, I can trust what I see in the pipeline and the forecast is going to materialize at the end of the quarter. It typically grows during the quarter, it doesn't go up, it doesn\u2019t go down. So it speaks, I think, to the quality of the work the sales team is doing and the quality of the motion we have put in place. When you talk about this specific customer, like a customer that pays us eight or nine figures, these deals are growth deals. They are expansion deals. And so we get those deals by making those customers successful over the last period of time and then engaging with their teams as we ship new products, making sure they get their hands on these products. And by the time we get to have a sales conversation, typically, the usage is there. The customers have tried the product. They understand them. They've spoken to our product teams about them or support teams about them. And then it's more a matter of understanding how we package that commercially and how we make a good case for it with the customer including understanding what other products they might retire as part of that. When you think of sales times for brand-new customers, the time it takes is highly dependent on the size of the land. Most of our lands are small and can go very fast, which is for a large enterprise, it could be a quarter or two, which is very short for an enterprise deal, could be longer for some larger deals.\nRay McDonough: Great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question And it comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. And Oli, I wanted to dig into your comments on security. I think you mentioned that you have 6,000 customers that are now using one or more security product. Can you give us a little bit more color. First of all, who is the buyer usually do you see for these solutions initially? And then second, maybe you can kind of parse out a little bit more color on ranking order kind of the more popular versus least popular security products right now? Would love to get more color on that.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. So the buyers, it depends. For infrastructure security and application security, this tends to be the DevOps teams that start buying with some involvement on the security teams on their end. For our cloud SIEM product, the buyer tends to be the security team. So we have a little bit of both. And it turns out we're successful in both ends. So both types of products are growing in a similar way. The focus has been over the past year on developing the products, getting them to maturity, getting them into the hands of as many customers as possible and also getting as much usage of those products as possible. So the metrics we look at internally with our security products are even more than the revenue which can vary with usage and things like that. We look at the activity. How many of those customers are actually using the product, how many issues are being tracked are being solved for the products. And these are the North Stars we use internally as we develop those products.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. And then as a follow-up, maybe just to dig into this a little more. When customers buy these, I mean, how often is it, there's a vacuum there. There's no solution versus a displacement? Or how often do you kind of sit side by side by other solutions that do the same thing like in the same way the companies had multiple monitoring solutions? Will they just have same security solutions from other vendors? Or this is a complete replacement or greenfield? Would love to get more color on that.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. In most situations, we start side by side with other things because customers are going to have other security solutions, and they typically have a patchwork of a lot of different things, which is not very different from the situation when we started selling our infrastructure and APM products, I would say, seven, eight, 10 years ago. So very similar. The customers that spend more with us, so we have a number of customers that spend more than $1 million a year with us on security because a large number of customers has spent more than $100,000 a year with us on security. Those tend to use less other products and consolidate more into what we do. And obviously, the playbook here is the same for us as it has been for observability. By the way, you did ask me to stack rank the security products. Didn't forget about that. It's easy in order of introduction. Like the cloud team has the most usage and was introduced first and then the other products are still below that.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. And it comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham. Please proceed.\nMike Cikos: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess first, a question for David. Again, just coming back to the guidance here, wanted to get some more color, if we could, on December into January. So it's great to hear that January this year seems to be trending better than the seasonal drop that we saw in January of last year. Just wanted to get a better sense. The holidays seemed to play out the way that you guys expected but can you provide some more color or parameters on that December holiday slowdown and then how that is playing out in January versus where we stand today in mid-February?\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. It\u2019s as you said, we've seen, and we've tried to flag that in the second half of December, we have a slowdown of usage, particularly in our sort of our more use oriented products like logs. It played out very similarly to what we expected. And I think we caution everybody, it's too narrow of a data point. But the bounce back from that and the growth in January was stronger than the bounce back last year, and we'll have to see how the rest of the quarter plays out.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. And in general, I think we -- throughout the rest of the company, we've seen a slowdown in December, I mean for good reasons, like there\u2019s all sorts of environments get turned off developers, some companies close shop altogether for one week at the end of the year. So we -- it's become more pronounced starting last year, I think, because companies put -- wanted to see some cost control and maybe they automate some processes to downscale or shut things down at the end of the year. And this year was consistent with last year. It's hard to compare year-to-year exactly because some of that, for example, depends on which day of the week the holidays are or in terms of how much the impact of usage. But overall, what we saw was very consistent with what we had last year.\nMike Cikos: Great. [indiscernible] Understood. And thanks for that, Oli. I do appreciate the additional color. And just for a quick follow-up here, I know that you guys are citing the expanded penetration of the Fortune 500, and it's great to hear the five points of tick-up when you think about the 42% of Fortune 500 customers using it today. Wanted to get a better sense. I know you guys are saying that, I guess, those customers on average are still spending less than $500,000 with you. So I know it's a bit of a point in time here, but a two-parter. First, can you help us think about if you had 37% of the Fortune 500 last year and 42% this year, like how has that average spend per customer within the Fortune 500 increased over the last year? And then the second part of that question is, if the 42% of Fortune 500 customers with you are on average under $500,000 at this point, where does Datadog ultimately see that opportunity going to -- just given -- I know you guys are talking about the 400 new features and capabilities launched in the last year, but where does that spend increase to over time?\nDavid Obstler: Just to give you -- we're not sort of giving specific data on the expansion of that group. We have -- if you look at our larger customers and you just look at the trend over time, you can see that in the land and expand model, we have had an increase of average customer size with us in the group over $100,000. And we said previously that we have customers in the tens of millions. We have those customers within the Fortune statistic as well as outside. And so we said in the past that we see buying patterns in the tens of millions. We think that in many of the larger, more traditional enterprises, they're just getting started, and there's a lot of upside is what we're trying to communicate.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. And definitely, actually, customer on the Fortune 500, that's in the hundreds of thousands should be in the millions to tens of millions with us in the end. There's no question about that.\nMike Cikos: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. And it's from the line of Frederick Havemeyer with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed.\nFrederick Havemeyer: Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a bit more of a forward-looking technological question here, perhaps to Oli. There's been quite a lot of, at this point, let's say, testing development, but a lot of interesting development with like autonomous agents for DevOps-related task. So I'm curious, as you're considering the opportunity and potentially some of the risks also around Generative AI and perhaps like agentic usage of large language models, how are you thinking that Datadog is positioned strategically, both from a and perhaps pricing perspective around this technology trend?\nOlivier Pomel: We think we're ideally positioned for that. It's actually -- one of the things maybe we -- if you attend our Investor Day, like we'll share some of our thinking on the topic. But we -- so we've been actively building on our Bits AI assistant. We've been interacting with customers based on that. There's a number of ways for us to build on that and to do more to automate work for our customers, and that's something we're working on. And we also see a lot of demand and expectations on the customer side for incorporating Generative AI in the product. So I think from a positioning perspective, we feel great about that. We don't have much more to share today, but we are just definitely top of mind.\nFrederick Havemeyer: Sorry, I don't mean to ask about the Investor Day, too early here. So look forward to that this week. Just quickly then also, I understand the perspective on complexity driving more usage of observability and DevOps tooling. But I think last quarter, we got an update on where GenAI-related operations were contributing to the business. Would you have into Q4, any data or points you could share about how much Generative AI in these use cases are contributing? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, we said -- so we said 3% of our ARR comes from the AI native companies. And look, it's hard for us to wrap our arms exactly around what is GenAI, what is not among our customer base and their workload. So the way we chose to do it is we looked at a smaller number of companies that we know are substantially all based on AI. So you have companies like the model providers and things like that. So 3% of ARR, which is up from what we had disclosed last time. I know one number that everyone has been thinking about is one cloud, in particular, Microsoft disclosed that 6% of their growth was attributable to AI. And we definitely see the benefits of that on our end too. If I look at our Azure business in particular, there is substantially more than 6% that is attributable to AI native as part of our Azure business. So we see completely the -- this trend is very true for us as well. It's harder to tell with the other cloud providers because they don\u2019t break those numbers up.\nFrederick Havemeyer: Great. Thank you. And congrats on a good quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. And it comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. Please proceed.\nPatrick Colville: Hi there. Thank you for taking my question and it\u2019s really great to be on the call. I would like to actually double-click on this kind of from ARR from kind of AI native companies. I mean my question is, like, are the product SKUs, these kind of GenAI companies are adopting, are they similar or are they different to the kind of other customer cohorts? And then I guess when I think about GenAI, I think we can all agree that these are pretty -- typically pretty computerly intensive workloads. So how does GenAI -- how do these companies kind of impact the financial model in -- versus traditional kind of your other customer cohorts? Is there any kind of differences to call out?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. There's not many differences today. I think -- and today, this is largely the same SKU as everybody else. These are infrastructure, APM logs profiling these kind of things that they're, or release or monitoring these kind of things that these customers are using. It's worth noting that they're in a bit of a separate world because they're largely the builders of the models. So all the tooling required to understand the models and -- that's less applicable to them. That's more applicable to their own customers, which is also the rest of our customer base. And we see also where we see the bulk of the opportunity in the longer term, not in the handful of model providers that anybody is going to use. In terms of the economics, look, we -- so there's two parts to the AI workloads today. There's training and there's inference. The vast majority of the players are training. There's only a few that are scaling with inference. The ones that are scaling with inference are the ones that are driving our ARR because we are -- we don't -- we're not really present on the training side, but we're very present on the inference side. And I think that also lines up with what you might see from some of the cloud providers, where a lot of the players or some of the players that are scaling the most are on Azure today on the inference side, whereas a lot of the other players still largely trading on some of the other clouds.\nPatrick Colville: Okay. Very helpful. I guess the other question I want to touch on is, for me, the standout comments from your prepared remarks that were just fascinating were about the kind of intensity of optimization having dissipated. I think you also called out the headwinds over the last few quarters have slowed materially, which is really great to hear. I guess with that in mind, looking at the guidance, the guidance for 4Q was 22%. The guidance for 1Q is the same. And for the fiscal year is 21% growth. So I guess, just help us understand the puts and takes between the commentary about kind of optimization having dissipated and guidance and what kind of the levers you pulled thinking about that guidance?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. We stick to our guns for guidance, which is -- our practice is we look at the trends for the past two quarters, we discount them and we carry that forward. This is where we build guidance. The beauty of our model is that it is usage driven and we benefit from the move to the cloud of our customers and the way they scale. The only problem with that is that we do not drive that, and it is hard to time it. It's hard to understand if the customers have the intent to scale and they want open the application, it's hard to time it to understand whether it's going to be next quarter or two quarters from now. So that's why we look at the past trends, and we try not to think too hard about what we hope might happen in the near term. Obviously, we're in a much stronger set than we were last year, though.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. I think if you repeat in a little bit different words, what Oli said, I think if you look at our history, we always take the most recent performance trends and discount that. So even if we are seeing improvement what we do in our guidance in conservatism, again, because of the consumption model, is we do discount that. So that would be consistent with what we've done throughout our history as a public company.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. And just to give you a better example, like we had a number of customers sign large long-term commitments with us that are well above their current level of consumption. But we do not know when those commitments are going to turn into revenue. We trust that they will, customers trust that they will. They spent a lot of time over the past year thinking about optimizing and what they actually needed and where they were going in the future, where I think they are less prone to overcommitting that they might have been a couple of years ago. But again, we do not -- we cannot call that on to the revenue yet.\nYuka Broderick: Carmen, we\u2019ll take our last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, thank you very much and congratulations on a really solid set of results for the quarter. I'll ask my question jointly. And could you talk about, first, how you see the net retention rate unfolding for the year? And I realize that's a backward-looking metric. But I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that as we progress through the year even directionally. And the second broader question is about diversification. One of the interesting stats you gave was growth of outside of your core APM and infra growing 75%. Just, is there any metrics you can give on what percent of that is your base? Or how we should be thinking about the diversification of the portfolio? In my opinion, Datadog has certainly the broadest portfolio in the category. I'm just wondering how that diversity is contributing to your growth as we look out? Again, if I'm pulling from the Investor Day, then I apologize.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. So we do not provide guidance on net retention. I think we said that for the first time in Q4, we had more ARR add than we had in the year-ago quarter, and that would indicate the stabilization of net retention, but do not provide guidance. It's all incorporated in our revenue guidance. As far as platform, yes, totally we've given a number of metrics about this. Remember, last quarter, we talked about the three pillars, and we said that we had essentially the [$1.5 billion and $500 million] (ph) and that's been a huge driver. In terms of this metric, this is in addition to that, a metric that the expansion, as you said, of the platform is further than those three pillars and is an additional product and is a significant driver of our growth.\nOlivier Pomel: I will say though, having the growth portfolio of product also really helps with this consolidation deals in particular. Sometimes -- maybe a couple of products are only going to get us $100,000 each as part of a $5 million deal. But having those two products help the customer rationalize what they have on the other hand save us million dollars and have made the case for the other $4.8 million of the deal. So it's really -- the platform as a whole really has a strong impact beyond the revenue of some of the individual products.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: And with that, we conclude the Q&A session for now. I will turn it back to Olivier Pomel for final comments.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. Again, I want to thank you everyone for -- everyone at Datadog for a great year, all of our customers for going through a -- I know it was a tougher time for them as well. We\u2019re actually very excited in what was coming in 2024. I think we have a great setup from a customer perspective, a great lineup on the product side and we expect to build. So thank you all.\nOperator: And thank you all for joining our call today. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a good Q4 to end what has been a very productive year to 2023. Throughout the year, we kept innovating at a fast pace, going broader and deeper into the problems we solve for our customers. We also continue to add new customers and expand with existing ones, driving both usage growth and adoption of new products. But most of all, I'm very pleased that we mobilized as a company to help our customers get through a tougher economic environment. We help our customers make more efficient use of their cloud and observability, leaving them in a better position at the end of the year, from which they can focus again on growing their businesses and migrating to the cloud. Now, let me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. Revenue was $590 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 27,300 customers, up from about 23,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 3,190 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,780 last year. These customers generated about 86% of our ARR. We had 396 customers with an ARR of $1 million or more, compared to the 317 we had at the end of last year. And we generated free cash flow of $201 million, with a free cash flow margin of 34%. Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 81% a year ago. 47% of customers were using four or more products, up from 42% a year ago. 22% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 18% a year ago. And as a sign of continued penetration of our platform, 9% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 6% a year ago. And our success with cross-product adoption isn't limited to core observability, as our newer products continue to gain traction. Note, for example, that the ARR for products outside of infrastructure monitoring, APM suite, and log management grew by more than 75% year-over-year. As a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, Synthetics, RUM, and Continuous Profiler. During 2023, we continued to land and expand with larger customers. As of December 2023, 42% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, up from 37% last year. We think many of the largest enterprises are still very early in their journey to the cloud. The median Datadog ARR for Fortune 500 customers is still less than $0.5 million, which leaves a very large opportunity for us to grow with these customers. Now, let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q4, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was similar to Q3. Our usage growth during the quarter played out roughly as expected, including a strong start in October and the slowdown we typically see at the end of December. We also note that the greater intensity of optimization we've seen over the past six quarters appears to have dissipated. For the last couple of quarters, we have discussed with you a cohort of customers who are optimizing. In Q4, this cohort's usage grew at a faster pace than the broader customer base. We take this as a positive sign. To be clear, we see optimization activity with our customers every quarter. We expect them to continuously make sure they are using their cloud efficiently, and we'll keep helping them do that. And we do still see attention to cost in certain parts of our customer base, but overall, we see less headwinds than we did a few quarters ago. Meanwhile, we had a strong bookings quarter in Q4. Our go-to-market teams delivered our largest annualized bookings since Q1 of '22. And our enterprise team in particular executed on a record amount of annualized bookings in Q4. We are also seeing more customers enter into multiyear deals with us, which speaks to our deepening relationships with them, as well as customers planning for growth and for the longer term after a period of optimization and uncertainty. As a reminder, our bookings don't translate immediately into revenue growth, but it is an indicator that we continue to serve our new and existing customers well, and they are growing with us over time. Finally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid-to-high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers. Moving on to R&D, we released over 400 new features and capabilities during 2023. Of course, that's too much for us to cover today, but let me speak to a few. In observability, we now have more than 700 integrations, allowing our customers to benefit from the latest AWS, Azure and GCP capabilities, as well as from the newly emerging AI stack. We continue to see increasing engagement there with the use of our NextGen AI integrations growing 75% sequentially in Q4. In the Generative AI and LLM space, we continue to add capabilities to Bits AI, our natural language incident management copilot, and we are advancing LLM observability to help customers investigate how they can safely deploy and manage their models in production. Today, about 3% of our ARR comes from NextGen AI native customers, but we believe the opportunity is far larger in the future as customers of every industry and every size start deploying AI functionality in production. In the APM space, we launched Data Streams Monitoring to monitor queuing, streaming and event-driven pipelines, which is a technically challenging type of workloads APM products have historically struggled to cover. We also rolled out single-step APM onboarding, allowing a single engineer to enable APM across complex applications in minutes. And with dynamic instrumentation, engineers can add logs, metrics, and traces to their applications on the fly without code changes or redeployment. In the digital experience area, we've added heat maps and scroll maps to our real user monitoring product to show developer and product owners what their users are actually seeing. And our customers can now create synthetic tests directly from Session Replay, for which, we have received very positive feedback. And in log management, we continue to expand our capabilities. Starting with Flex logs, customers can have cost-effective -- very cost-effective way to retain their logs at a very large scale. With error tracking for logs, customers can quickly cut down millions of error lines into a handful of actionable summaries. And our log pipeline scanner allows customers to inspect log events in near real-time, building greater visibility into data quality and data governance. In Cloud Service Management, we made workflow automation generally available, enabling customers to easily automate and orchestrate processes across operations and security. And today, we are announcing the general availability of case management to provide engineers with a single view for investigations, ticketing, to-do items, tasks, and follow-ups across the Datadog platform. Moving on to Cloud Security. We kept executing against an ambitious roadmap and are pleased to know count over 6,000 customers using one or more Datadog Security products. This month, we launched software composition analysis to enable our customers to proactively detect and remediate vulnerabilities before the code gets to production. We announced Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management to help customers prevent identity and access management security issues. We shipped cloud SIEM investigator, so customers can conduct deep security investigation using logs over long periods of time. We simplified security operations with our security inbox to allow our customers to correlate security issues into one single list to investigate and remediate. And we also expanded our data security capabilities. Sensitive Data Scanner now finding secrets and sensitive data in traces and run events, in addition to logs. In Software Delivery, we launched Intelligent Test Runner, which dramatically accelerates the testing process in CI/CD. And we shipped code quality and security gates to enforce best practices, catch security vulnerabilities, and prevent flaky tests. And last, but not least, we delivered on a number of platform-wide initiatives. We launched our latest data center in Japan to help customers comply with local data privacy laws. We opened up CoScreen throughout our platform for collaboration, incident response, [fair] (ph) programming, and debugging. We extended Cloud Cost Management, which is now GA for AWS and Azure and will soon be for GCP, to offer a comprehensive view of costs across our customers' cloud footprint. And we announced our intent to achieve FedRAMP High and Impact Level 5 authorizations. So I'd like to thank our product and engineering teams for a very productive 2023 and I'm super excited with what we have planned for 2024. Let's move on to sales and marketing. First of all, I'd like to welcome Sara Varni to the team, as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Sara brings more than 15 years of marketing experience centered around developers and enterprise software, and we really look forward to her leadership in this pivotal role. As I said earlier, we had a very strong close to 2023 with record levels of bookings and some very exciting new logos and expansions. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed a three-year expansion and our first-ever nine-figure TCV deal with a major global fintech company. This expansion brings us into a major new business unit that we were not deployed in before. And this time, the customer focused on bringing end-to-end observability to their mobile applications and they focus, in particular, on being in front of any user-impacting issues through the use of our Real User Monitoring product. With this renewal, this customer expects to use 15 Datadog products and will consolidate what used to be 10 separate tools, including the replacement of three commercial products across infrastructure monitoring, APM, and RUM. Next, we signed a seven-figure expansion with one of the world's largest restaurant chains. This customer is using AWS, Azure, GCP, and Oracle Cloud and they believe Datadog is the only platform that can deliver a consistent experience across all four clouds. With this expansion, the customer plans to deploy Datadog for Cloud Service Management use cases and will expand to a total of 10 Datadog products. Next, we signed an eight-figure multiyear expansion with a leading European financial services company. This customer is undergoing a large-scale migration to Azure and will expand its use of Datadog across on-prem, private, and public cloud. Today, Datadog is used by 3,000 users every month in over 400 teams to monitor 13,000 hosts. With the migration, the Datadog platform usage will expand to more than 1,000 teams and 50,000 hosts. This customer plans to use 14 Datadog products and consolidate more than 10 legacy open source and cloud monitoring tools. Next, we signed a seven-figure land with one of the world's largest food and consumer goods company. This customer wants to be more proactive with risk mitigation and system resilience as they migrate to Azure. They also want to reduce the thousands of hours of engineering time they spend every year in incident triage. This customer brought in Datadog to be the observability foundation of their AIOps strategy, in particular using Watchdog and our incident management capabilities. This new land includes 17 Datadog products and the customer expects to consolidate at least six commercial observability tools. Finally, we signed a six-figure land deal with one of the largest US utilities. This customer is re-architecting its customer-facing website and re-platforming its customer support experience. They identified Datadog as the only platform that could still easily integrate end-to-end with their existing sales, customer experience, and data workflows. This customer expects to start with six Datadog products and they will displace two commercial observability tools in the process. And that's it for this quarter's highlight. Congrats again to our go-to-market teams for their great work in 2023, an excellent close of the year, and ambitious plans for 2024. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, a few words on our longer-term outlook. During 2023, we continued to execute on our product innovation plans and we solved more problems and delivered more value to customers. As we enter 2024, it appears that the worst of cloud optimization may be behind us. We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business and critical motions for every company to deliver value and competitive advantage. We see AI adoption as an additional driver of investment and accelerator of technical innovation and cloud migration. And more than ever, we feel ideally positioned to achieve our goals and help customers of every size in every industry to transform, innovate, and drive value through technology adoption. With that, I will turn it over to David. Well, it's a good question. I would say, pretty much all of the above. I think the -- it's always a little bit hard to time the cycles for specific subsets of the customer base as various macro conditions ripple through the economy [like the assets, various] (ph) different parts of our customer base. We suddenly saw a big slowdown from the digital native over the past year. On the other hand, they might be the first ones to fully leverage AI and deploy it in production. So you might see some reacceleration earlier from some of them at least. If you zoom at a little bit, our focus over the past few years has been on really going to market aggressively on the enterprise, the mid-market, the more traditional side of the world that still has to largely [get us clearly] (ph) to the cloud. We've planted a lot of seeds there with a number of large companies that still have relatively small deployments in the cloud. And our focus over the next couple of years is going to be to grow them and obviously land the ones we still don't have. We mentioned on the call about 42% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, and they're still largely small, like a few hundred thousand dollars a year spent on us. So that's where we direct our efforts. So in general, what we do is when we do these larger multiproduct or consolidation deals, we have a specific rate card and customers can have total fund commitment and customers can allocate the funds in real time to the products they need when they them, which, by the way, gives them a lot of flexibility they don't have when they have to manage like five different vendors for different parts of their coverage. There are some exceptions. There are some customers that have such a specific and large volume requirement for one product in particular. Typically, this would be things like logs or maybe metrics and things like that, where they get specific commitments in place around specific products. But in general, most customers have a lot of flexibility when they take these commitments with us. And we'll see -- we'll show some examples also at the Investor Day. I have -- the mix of spend can change over time with customers while we expand and cover more and more of the environment. And really we should emphasize that this is really a change of stance of the customer base compared to last year. So last year, customers were in optimization mode. They didn't know what their consumption should look like. They didn't know economically what they were shooting for as businesses. After a year of optimization, a year of examining everything -- I mean, we see customers recommit for much longer periods of time than they did before as they focus on growing and investing. So it's a -- we like the set up a lot more than we did last year from that perspective. And you see that in the billings numbers. Yeah, we see the attach rate going up. The reason for that is our framework for that is actually in terms of complexity. AI just adds more complexity. You create more things faster without understanding what they do. Meaning, you need -- you shift a lot of the value from building to running, managing and understanding, securing all the other things that need to keep happening after that. So the shape of some of the products might change a little bit because the shape of the software that runs it changed a little bit, which is not different from what happened over the past 10, 15 years. But we think it's going to drive more need for observability, more need for security products around that. Thank you. So I'll start with the large companies that are still small customers. That's completely due to them being small in the cloud today. And so typically, they have maybe one of their business units, two of their business units in the cloud with some fraction of the applications there. The goal is to have them consolidate on us as they move more into the cloud. So go end-to-end in a specific business unit and then expand to the whole enterprise at the end. So the difference between a customer that, like the ones we mentioned today that signs a nine-figure deal with us and a customer that's still at the low hundreds of thousands of dollars, is that the one that has the fact that large deal has us pretty much wall-to-wall in a significant part of their business and has consolidated a large part of their observability. I should say, the customer that pays us nine figures still hasn't consolidated everything on us with there still more upside to be had, more parts of their businesses, more parts of their coverage we can get. The good news is that all of that business is coming to us as these customers move into the cloud. The bad news is that we don't drive the move to the cloud, right? So in periods where it goes a little bit more slowly than we've seen over the past year, that growth can be a little bit slower. But we are very confident into the fact that this is going to happen. AI is going to accelerate. It's going to make it even more relevant. And that's the trend that's going to stay with us for the next few years. On the competition side, there's no real change. I think I would say very boring from a competitive perspective in that the situation is pretty much the same as it was last quarter and the quarter before. There's definitely opportunity with a number of companies, including one that's large and has been sold. I'm sure everybody has seen. Because we're not competitors, we were seeing very often on the cloud side of the world already. I think these commuters have retreated a bit more to the traditional on-prem bread and butter but we think it is going to open more opportunity in the midterm, definitely. So that's something we are aware of. There's no change at scale that we've done are worth noting on this call. We made a lot of adjustments in the way we say all the time. We make adjustments in the we package our products. For example, we package some of our security products directly into our infrastructure and APM products. We have a new tier called DevSecOps for both APM and infrastructure, and these are great ways for us to actually bring those products into the conversation, make them easier for customers to discover and also make them easier for the sales force to bring up and to sell. And we see we're actually starting to see great success with that. So still very early, obviously, because [indiscernible] last quarter, but we like what we see with those SKUs. More broadly, we're investing in the sales force. We're increasing capacities. We've increased capacity last year, even though it was a slowdown year in the economy and we have plans to increase the capacity again this year. And we think there's plenty more markets for us to be had, both in terms of the -- inside the segments in which we're already very present, but also in a number of new categories -- sorry, new segments of the market, new geographies that we don't cover very well yet. Yes. Because of the way we do business, where we try and land fast and small, we expand after that on an ongoing basis. We don't really -- we haven't seen -- even in last year, what's been a tougher year for most sales organizations, we haven't seen an elongation of sales cycles. It remained very, very stable. In general, we always felt that our sales pipelines were very solid. As a CEO, when I start the quarter, I can trust what I see in the pipeline and the forecast is going to materialize at the end of the quarter. It typically grows during the quarter, it doesn't go up, it doesn't go down. So it speaks, I think, to the quality of the work the sales team is doing and the quality of the motion we have put in place. When you talk about this specific customer, like a customer that pays us eight or nine figures, these deals are growth deals. They are expansion deals. And so we get those deals by making those customers successful over the last period of time and then engaging with their teams as we ship new products, making sure they get their hands on these products. And by the time we get to have a sales conversation, typically, the usage is there. The customers have tried the product. They understand them. They've spoken to our product teams about them or support teams about them. And then it's more a matter of understanding how we package that commercially and how we make a good case for it with the customer including understanding what other products they might retire as part of that. When you think of sales times for brand-new customers, the time it takes is highly dependent on the size of the land. Most of our lands are small and can go very fast, which is for a large enterprise, it could be a quarter or two, which is very short for an enterprise deal, could be longer for some larger deals. Yeah. So the buyers, it depends. For infrastructure security and application security, this tends to be the DevOps teams that start buying with some involvement on the security teams on their end. For our cloud SIEM product, the buyer tends to be the security team. So we have a little bit of both. And it turns out we're successful in both ends. So both types of products are growing in a similar way. The focus has been over the past year on developing the products, getting them to maturity, getting them into the hands of as many customers as possible and also getting as much usage of those products as possible. So the metrics we look at internally with our security products are even more than the revenue which can vary with usage and things like that. We look at the activity. How many of those customers are actually using the product, how many issues are being tracked are being solved for the products. And these are the North Stars we use internally as we develop those products. Yeah. In most situations, we start side by side with other things because customers are going to have other security solutions, and they typically have a patchwork of a lot of different things, which is not very different from the situation when we started selling our infrastructure and APM products, I would say, seven, eight, 10 years ago. So very similar. The customers that spend more with us, so we have a number of customers that spend more than $1 million a year with us on security because a large number of customers has spent more than $100,000 a year with us on security. Those tend to use less other products and consolidate more into what we do. And obviously, the playbook here is the same for us as it has been for observability. By the way, you did ask me to stack rank the security products. Didn't forget about that. It's easy in order of introduction. Like the cloud team has the most usage and was introduced first and then the other products are still below that. Yeah. And in general, I think we -- throughout the rest of the company, we've seen a slowdown in December, I mean for good reasons, like there's all sorts of environments get turned off developers, some companies close shop altogether for one week at the end of the year. So we -- it's become more pronounced starting last year, I think, because companies put -- wanted to see some cost control and maybe they automate some processes to downscale or shut things down at the end of the year. And this year was consistent with last year. It's hard to compare year-to-year exactly because some of that, for example, depends on which day of the week the holidays are or in terms of how much the impact of usage. But overall, what we saw was very consistent with what we had last year. Yeah. And definitely, actually, customer on the Fortune 500, that's in the hundreds of thousands should be in the millions to tens of millions with us in the end. There's no question about that. We think we're ideally positioned for that. It's actually -- one of the things maybe we -- if you attend our Investor Day, like we'll share some of our thinking on the topic. But we -- so we've been actively building on our Bits AI assistant. We've been interacting with customers based on that. There's a number of ways for us to build on that and to do more to automate work for our customers, and that's something we're working on. And we also see a lot of demand and expectations on the customer side for incorporating Generative AI in the product. So I think from a positioning perspective, we feel great about that. We don't have much more to share today, but we are just definitely top of mind. Yeah, we said -- so we said 3% of our ARR comes from the AI native companies. And look, it's hard for us to wrap our arms exactly around what is GenAI, what is not among our customer base and their workload. So the way we chose to do it is we looked at a smaller number of companies that we know are substantially all based on AI. So you have companies like the model providers and things like that. So 3% of ARR, which is up from what we had disclosed last time. I know one number that everyone has been thinking about is one cloud, in particular, Microsoft disclosed that 6% of their growth was attributable to AI. And we definitely see the benefits of that on our end too. If I look at our Azure business in particular, there is substantially more than 6% that is attributable to AI native as part of our Azure business. So we see completely the -- this trend is very true for us as well. It's harder to tell with the other cloud providers because they don't break those numbers up. Yes. There's not many differences today. I think -- and today, this is largely the same SKU as everybody else. These are infrastructure, APM logs profiling these kind of things that they're, or release or monitoring these kind of things that these customers are using. It's worth noting that they're in a bit of a separate world because they're largely the builders of the models. So all the tooling required to understand the models and -- that's less applicable to them. That's more applicable to their own customers, which is also the rest of our customer base. And we see also where we see the bulk of the opportunity in the longer term, not in the handful of model providers that anybody is going to use. In terms of the economics, look, we -- so there's two parts to the AI workloads today. There's training and there's inference. The vast majority of the players are training. There's only a few that are scaling with inference. The ones that are scaling with inference are the ones that are driving our ARR because we are -- we don't -- we're not really present on the training side, but we're very present on the inference side. And I think that also lines up with what you might see from some of the cloud providers, where a lot of the players or some of the players that are scaling the most are on Azure today on the inference side, whereas a lot of the other players still largely trading on some of the other clouds. Yes. We stick to our guns for guidance, which is -- our practice is we look at the trends for the past two quarters, we discount them and we carry that forward. This is where we build guidance. The beauty of our model is that it is usage driven and we benefit from the move to the cloud of our customers and the way they scale. The only problem with that is that we do not drive that, and it is hard to time it. It's hard to understand if the customers have the intent to scale and they want open the application, it's hard to time it to understand whether it's going to be next quarter or two quarters from now. So that's why we look at the past trends, and we try not to think too hard about what we hope might happen in the near term. Obviously, we're in a much stronger set than we were last year, though. Yeah. And just to give you a better example, like we had a number of customers sign large long-term commitments with us that are well above their current level of consumption. But we do not know when those commitments are going to turn into revenue. We trust that they will, customers trust that they will. They spent a lot of time over the past year thinking about optimizing and what they actually needed and where they were going in the future, where I think they are less prone to overcommitting that they might have been a couple of years ago. But again, we do not -- we cannot call that on to the revenue yet. I will say though, having the growth portfolio of product also really helps with this consolidation deals in particular. Sometimes -- maybe a couple of products are only going to get us $100,000 each as part of a $5 million deal. But having those two products help the customer rationalize what they have on the other hand save us million dollars and have made the case for the other $4.8 million of the deal. So it's really -- the platform as a whole really has a strong impact beyond the revenue of some of the individual products. Thank you. Again, I want to thank you everyone for -- everyone at Datadog for a great year, all of our customers for going through a -- I know it was a tougher time for them as well. We're actually very excited in what was coming in 2024. I think we have a great setup from a customer perspective, a great lineup on the product side and we expect to build. So thank you all."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. Q4 revenue was $590 million, up 26% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of this Q4 performance, first, regarding usage growth. Overall, we saw usage growth from existing customers in Q4 that was similar to what we saw in Q3. Last quarter, we mentioned that the larger and more intense optimizers had begun to show signs of stabilization. In Q4, we saw those trends continue and the large optimizers begin to grow again. While we may still be in a cost-conscious environment overall, we believe that the higher intensity of optimization has dissipated and clients are continuing to invest in new digital applications. For the first time in six quarters, our sequential ARR adds in Q4 were higher than in the year-ago quarter. As we look at early data for Q1, January usage growth was solid. The rebound we're seeing from the slower end of December is better than what we experienced last January. We note as always that it's too early to know how the quarter will play out, and we would caution investors from extrapolating too much, but we're encouraged by the near-term trend. Regarding usage growth by customer size, we experienced our highest growth in our largest and smaller spending customers in this quarter. This includes a record increase in sequential ARR added from customers who spend $1 million or more annually with us, and an expansion of 1 million plus customers from 317 to 396 over 2023. In terms of new logos, our customer additions on a gross and net basis, as well as on a new dollar -- a new logo dollar basis were similar to that of Q3. As before, our net adds including -- included slightly elevated churn in our very long tail of small customers, many of whom are self-service. Geographically, we experienced stronger year-over-year revenue growth in international markets in North America. Our international markets represented 31% of our revenue in Q4 2023, up from 28% in Q4 of last year. Finally, for our retention metrics. Our trailing twelve month net revenue retention was in the mid-110s in Q4. Our trailing 12 month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid to high 90s. And our dollar churn is low and declined sequentially. Now, moving on to our financial results. Billings were $723 million, up 35% year-over-year. Billings duration increased year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.84 billion, up 74% year-over-year. Current RPR growth was in the mid-40s percent year-over-year. We are continuing to see an increasing interest with our larger customers in multiyear commitments, which results in longer RPO duration in both total and current RPO. We welcome the opportunity to have these longer-term strategic partnerships with our clients. And we see that once customers are farther along in their optimizations, they feel comfortable committing over longer periods of time in the future. As we said before, we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now, let's review some of our key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $492 million, representing a gross margin of 83.4%. This compares to a gross margin of 82.3% last quarter and 80.6% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency products -- projects. Our Q4 OpEx grew 10% year-over-year, a decline from 17% year-over-year growth last quarter. As we discussed last quarter, while making meaningful investments in 2023, we were more cautious than in previous years given the macro condition and focused more on efficiency and optimization. We believe this will put us in a good position to accelerate investment in 2024 while maintaining margin discipline. Q4 operating income was $167 million, or a 28% operating margin, up from 24% last quarter and 18% in the year-ago quarter. As with last quarter, our margins ended up being higher than we expected in Q4 as we executed well on our internal optimization and cost management efforts. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $220 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $201 million with a free cash flow margin of 34%. Now for our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2024. Our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $591 million, which represents a 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $128 million to $132 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.33 to $0.35 per share based on approximately 35 -- 357 million of average diluted shares outstanding. For fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.555 billion to $2.575 billion, which represents 21% -- 20% to 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $535 million to $555 million, which implies an operating margin of 21% to 22% and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.44 per share based on 361 million average shares diluted outstanding. Some additional notes on guidance. As it relates to our growth in OpEx and hiring, as I mentioned earlier, we took a more cautious attitude towards hiring during 2023. And our headcount ended fiscal 2023 at about 5,200 people, growing in the high single digits year-over-year. We remain excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities. And as a result, our operating profit guidance reflects our intent to invest for future growth in 2024. We intend to accelerate hiring in R&D to execute on our long-term growth opportunities and in sales and marketing to reach customers worldwide. Because of that, our operating profit guidance implies operating expense growth in the mid-20% range year-over-year, with operating expense year-over-year growth ramping throughout 2024 as we execute on our hiring plans. Meanwhile, we will continue to balance our investments in long-term growth with financial discipline as we have executed in the past. Now turning to other areas of the P&L. First, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Regarding taxes, while we expect to continue to be a modest cash payer in 2024, estimated to be $20 million to $25 million, we are establishing a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in fiscal year 2024 and going forward. And this is reflected in our non-GAAP net income per share guidance. We have recasted our fiscal 2022 and '23 non-GAAP net income to reflect this non-GAAP tax rate, and that is available in the tables in our earnings release as well as the financial supplemental. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range in fiscal year 2024. Now to summarize, we are pleased with our execution in 2023. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys. And we plan to innovate further and expand the set of problems we solve for our customers in 2024 and beyond. I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in 2023, and I'm excited about our plans in 2024. Finally, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Investor Day this Thursday in New York City. Please go to the Datadog IR website for the live stream or contact the IR team at ir@datadoghq.com to attend in person. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yeah. There's a couple of aspects. First of all, given the sort of renewal cycle, Q4 tends to have more recommitments. So I think if you look back, you'll see that we tend to have nice billings growth. But in terms of where, it really was correlated with larger customers who, as Oli mentioned, are buying a more complete suite of Datadogs. It wasn't cloud native or not cloud native. It was our customers who have standardized on Datadog, have a good sense of their volumes and have committed longer, resulting in a longer average billing and contract duration in Q4 than we have had previously. Yeah. And on your second question, much of this growth is related to hiring, which takes time to do. We are trying to invest both in quota capacity, in terms of sales as well as in R&D capacity. Our intent is to open the heads earlier in the year in order to try to get return in the near term. But I think you can assume that, that investment will ramp throughout the year because it takes time to get the headcount in. And we gave the guidance for Q1 indicating what we think to happen in Q1. Yeah. It's as you said, we've seen, and we've tried to flag that in the second half of December, we have a slowdown of usage, particularly in our sort of our more use oriented products like logs. It played out very similarly to what we expected. And I think we caution everybody, it's too narrow of a data point. But the bounce back from that and the growth in January was stronger than the bounce back last year, and we'll have to see how the rest of the quarter plays out. Just to give you -- we're not sort of giving specific data on the expansion of that group. We have -- if you look at our larger customers and you just look at the trend over time, you can see that in the land and expand model, we have had an increase of average customer size with us in the group over $100,000. And we said previously that we have customers in the tens of millions. We have those customers within the Fortune statistic as well as outside. And so we said in the past that we see buying patterns in the tens of millions. We think that in many of the larger, more traditional enterprises, they're just getting started, and there's a lot of upside is what we're trying to communicate. Yeah. I think if you repeat in a little bit different words, what Oli said, I think if you look at our history, we always take the most recent performance trends and discount that. So even if we are seeing improvement what we do in our guidance in conservatism, again, because of the consumption model, is we do discount that. So that would be consistent with what we've done throughout our history as a public company. Yeah. So we do not provide guidance on net retention. I think we said that for the first time in Q4, we had more ARR add than we had in the year-ago quarter, and that would indicate the stabilization of net retention, but do not provide guidance. It's all incorporated in our revenue guidance. As far as platform, yes, totally we've given a number of metrics about this. Remember, last quarter, we talked about the three pillars, and we said that we had essentially the [$1.5 billion and $500 million] (ph) and that's been a huge driver. In terms of this metric, this is in addition to that, a metric that the expansion, as you said, of the platform is further than those three pillars and is an additional product and is a significant driver of our growth."

We are pleased with our execution in Q3, as we delivered another quarter of profitable growth and robust new logo bookings, and we continue to broaden our platform to have customers become and grow digital businesses. Let me start with a review of our Q3 financial performance. Revenue was $548 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 26,800 customers, up from about 22,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 3,130 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,600 last year. And these customers generated about 86% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $138 million with a free cash flow margin of 25%. Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q3, 82% of customers were using two or more products, up from 80% a year ago, 46% of customers were using four4 or more products, up from 40% a year ago, and 21% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 16% last year. Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q3, we saw usage growth of existing customers improve compared to Q2. Overall growth in Q3 was relatively consistent throughout the quarter and comparable to levels we've seen in Q1. We are seeing signs that the cloud optimization activity from some of our customers may be moderating. As a reminder, last quarter, we discussed a cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago, and we said that they appear to stabilize their usage growth at the end of Q2. That trend has held for the past several months, with that cohort's usage remaining stable throughout Q3. Overall, we continue to see impact from optimization in our business, but we believe that the intensity and breadth of optimization we've experienced in recent quarters is moderating. Meanwhile, our new logo activity has remained robust. New logo bookings continue to scale and grow year-over-year. And for the second quarter in a row, we closed a record number of new deals with more than $100,000 in annual commitments. With our land and expand model, we expect new logos to turn into much larger customers over time as they lean into the cloud and add up more of our products. Finally, regarding customer growth, we are pleased with the new logos, new workloads, and new product [indiscernible] we added this quarter. We added a number of exciting new customers in Q3, and I'll discuss a couple examples later. Note, that our total customer count is largely driven by our long tail of very small customers, while our sales motions are more targeted to the middle and high end of our prospects. And as a reflection of our team's strong execution, our net ads of customers over $100,000, saw an increase in Q3 compared to Q2. Despite a more cost-conscious demand environment over the past year, our business has continued to grow across product lines, and we are very proud to achieve several key milestones. First, our infrastructure monitoring ARR exceeded $1 billion. Today, our infrastructure products cover monitoring the performance of hosts, networks, containers, Kubernetes deployments, serverless functions, and other aspects of infrastructure in the cloud, as well as a full set of AI and machine learning tools to help our customers separate signal from noise. Second. Our APM suite, which includes core APM, synthetics, real user monitoring and continuous profiler exceeded $500 million in ARR. And we continue to expand our capabilities in APM, most recently with single step instrumentation, which allows a single engineer to enable APM across all applications without code changes and we achieved advances in mobile app monitoring, including mobile application testing and mobile session replay. Third, our log management product exceeded $500 million in ARR. We also continue to expand our capabilities in log management, and with Flex logs, customers can easily scale storage and compute separately, allowing for new and very high-volume logging use cases in a cost-effective manner. From the very beginning, my Co-Founder [Alexi] (ph) and I had a vision to create a unified platform that serves end-to-end use cases across datasets, products, and team boundaries. We believe that these ARR milestones and their balance across the three pillars of observability demonstrate that Datadog is unique within the industry in establishing true platform value for customers. And of course, even though these products have become significant in size, we are only just getting started. We will continue to innovate to deliver more solutions for our customers across observability and beyond. I will add that we have empathy for our customers and their pain points, in part, because we are ourselves users of cloud and next-gen technologies at a meaningful scale. And we extensively deploy a new [indiscernible] solution, which is appropriately known as dog fooding. As an example, we have extensively relied on our cloud cost management product as we expanded its capabilities this past year. And the use of our product has played a large role in delivering cost, performance, and efficiency improvements, optimizing our own cloud usage, and ultimately resulting in expansion of our gross margins in recent quarters. We also continue to innovate in the DevSecOps space. Our recent expansions in cloud security include Cloud Sim investigator, where customers can visualize logs over long periods of time to conduct security investigations. And within our cloud security management product, we have introduced Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management, or CIEM, to help customers prevent identity and access management security issues. For a few years now, the industry has been talking about the idea of DevSecOps, the breaking down of silos among development, operations, and security teams. And we entered the security space on the premise that DevOps and security teams should share the same data in the same platform. So starting this month, we are making the practice of DevSecOps easy to adopt for all customers by bringing together all the components needed to fully monitor and secure their entire stack with two simple packages. First, with infrastructure DevSecOps, our customers can observe and secure their entire cloud environment in one package. With a simple per-host price and a single agent deployed, customers get end-to-end visibility into performance, availability, and security issues in one place. And from that one place, teams can also quickly remediate problems using built-in workflows and without any code or configuration changes. Second, with APM DevSecOps, we take this one step further. Customers can instrument cloud applications for both performance and vulnerability issues in one single package, enabled with the same unified agent used for Infrastructure DevSecOps. APM DevSecOps complements Infrastructure DevSecOps by surfacing open-source and code level security vulnerabilities alongside performance issues. Finally, we continue to be excited about the opportunity in generative AI and large language models. First, we believe adopting next-gen AI will require the use of cloud and other modern technologies and drive additional growth in cloud workloads. So we are continuing to invest by integrating with more components at every layer of the new AI stack and by developing our own LLM observability products. And while we see signs of AI adoption across large parts of our customer base, in the near term, we continue to see AI-related usage manifest itself most accurately with next-gen AI-native customers, who contributed about 2.5% of our ARR this quarter. In the mid to long term, we expect customers of all industries and sizes to keep adding value to their products using AI and to get their early exploration -- to get from early exploration to development and into production, thus driving larger cloud and observability usage across our customer base. Besides observing the AI stack, we also expect to keep adding value to our own platform using AI. Datadog's unified platform and purely SaaS model, combined with strong multi-product adoption by our customers, generates a large amount of deep and precise observability data. We believe combining AI capabilities with this broad data set will allow us to deliver differentiated value to customers. And we are working to productize this differentiated value through recently announced capabilities such as our Bits AI assistant, AI generated synthetic tests, and AI-led error analysis and resolution. And we expect to deliver many more related innovation to customers over time. Let's move on to sales and marketing, where we continue to execute on both new logos and existing customers. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed a seven-figure land over five years with a leading provider of dental care. This company's legacy monitoring just didn't cut, and it contributed to delays with their migration to Azure. What concerned them was that, customers noticed poor application performance and were complaining publicly on social media. By adopting six Datadog products, they expect to find and fix the vast majority of incidents internally before their customers are affected. And in signing a five-year deal, this customer showed its confidence in Datadog as a long-term partner in their migration. Next, we signed a seven-figure land with a South American FinTech company. By moving from basic, built-in cloud monitoring, legacy tooling, and open-source tools to Datadog, this customer expects to significantly reduce costs by spending less on tooling, reducing time to resolution, and giving time back to engineers to innovate on their own products. Next, we signed an eight figure running all over three years with a major American chain of convenience stores. With this expansion, Datadog will bring all aspects of these customers' tech systems into one platform, including their application, hybrid clouds, network, in-store IoT technology, point of sale systems, self-serve kiosks, fuel pumps, and corporate infrastructure. This will free up employee time to focus on customer service with expectations to save millions of dollars annually. This customer plans to use six Datadog\u2019s products, replacing three commercial observability tools. Next, we signed a seven-figure expansion with a major US federal agency. When we first started working with this customer a year ago, Datadog was approved for a limited subset of programs. But as we have demonstrated value and gained internal adoption, this customer is now deploying Datadog across the entire agency. They have adopted six Datadog products, and by doing so, consolidated out of seven tools. Next, we found a seven-figure expansion with a Fortune 500 industrial company. Customer was concerned with out of control costs with its legacy log management products and was using a dozen of different tools. And when they began using Datadog, they noticed far fewer support tickets submitted to their reliability team. By growing usage with Datadog and expanding to seven products, this customer expects to deliver better service while saving time and reducing costs. And last, we signed a seven figure expansion with a software business that is part of a tech hyperscaler. This long-time customer has used Datadog for infrastructure metrics and will now expand to adopt seven Datadog products. Datadog will be replacing its commercial APM tool, which wasn't well adopted by its engineers and led to inefficient troubleshooting, outages, and revenue impact. Our support of OpenTelemetry in particular was key to their decision to expand with Datadog as it makes it possible for APM tracing to be democratized and used across their entire DevOps team. And that's it for this quarter's highlight. I'd like to thank our go to market teams for their strong execution in Q3. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, let me reiterate our longer term outlook. As we have said throughout this period of cloud optimization and macro uncertainty, our long-term plans have remained unchanged. We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business and critical motions for every company to deliver value and competitive advantage. So we continue to invest aggressively to broaden our platform and we aim -- sorry, and we aim to be our customers mission critical partners as we move to cloud and to modern DevSecOps. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, David.\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. Q3 revenue was $548 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of this Q3 performance, first regarding usage growth. We saw an improvement in usage growth in Q3 versus Q2. The Q3 usage growth was more similar to Q1 and relatively steady throughout the quarter. We had a very healthy start to Q4 in October. While it is too early in the quarter to know for sure what will happen in the next couple of months, the trends we see in early Q4 are stronger than they've been for the past year. Regarding usage growth by customer size, we continue to see larger spending customer growth at a slower rate than smaller spending customers, but usage growth improved for all customer sizes in Q3 relative to Q2. And as Olivier discussed, we believe there are signs that the optimization activity we've been seeing is moderating. Last quarter, we discussed the cohort of customers who started optimizing about a year ago. This cohorts usage has been stable -- was stable throughout Q3. As we look at our overall customer activity, we continue to see customers optimizing, but with less impact than we experienced in Q2, contributing to our usage growth with existing customers improving in Q3 relative to Q2. While we expect cost management to continue, we believe we are seeing moderation that is still present, but is less intense and less widespread than we experienced in recent quarters. Geographically, we experienced similar sequential revenue growth in North America and in our international markets. And finally, as regard to retention metrics, our trailing 12 month net revenue retention was in line with our expectations and came in slightly below 120% in Q3. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid to high 90s, a sign of the mission critical nature of our platform for our customers. Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $607 million up 30% year-over-year. Billings duration increased slightly year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO, was $1.45 billion, up 54% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was about 30% year-over-year. Over the past couple of quarters, we have seen an increasing preference from our customers to sign multi-year deals, and our weighted average booking duration was up sequentially and year-over-year. We see continued interest in multi-year duration deals in our pipeline as customers seek longer term strategic partnerships with us. We continue to believe that revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO, as those can fluctuate relative to revenues based on the timing of invoice and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $451 million, representing a gross margin of 82.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 81.3% last quarter and 79.7% in the year ago quarter. As Olivier mentioned, we continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold in the quarter, as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency projects. Our Q3 OpEx grew 17% year-over-year, this is a decline from 26% year-over-year growth last quarter. We continued to execute on controlling costs given the uncertain environment. And Q3 operating income was $131 million for a 24% operating margin, up from 21% last quarter and above the 17% in the year-ago quarter. Our margins were higher than we expected in Q3 as our organic growth was higher than in Q2, while our internal optimization and cost management efforts were successful. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. And cash flow from operations was $153 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $138 million for a free cash flow margin of 25%. And now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2023. A reminder, our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. We base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservativism on these growth trends. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $564 million to $568 million, which represents about 20% to 21% growth year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $129 million to $133 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.42 to $0.44 per share, based on approximately 355 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.103 billion to $2.107 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $453 million to $457 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.52 to $1.54 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Some additional notes for our guidance. First, we expect net interest income and net interest and other income for fiscal 2023 to be approximately $95 million. We expect tax expense in the fiscal year to be $12 million to $14 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range in fiscal 2023. And now regarding 2024. It is too early for us to speak to 2024 revenue growth. We will digest the information we see over the next several months and give you our 2024 revenue guidance next quarter. As it relates to non-GAAP profitability, our operating income and margins were a little higher in Q3 than we targeted, as usage growth improved from Q2 levels and we were successful with our cost efficiencies. We expect continued strong execution on profitability in Q4. At the same time, we continue to be excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities, and we have no shortage of investments to make and are confident in our ability to execute to strong ROI on those investments. As a result, while we are not providing 2024 margin guidance at this point, as always, we will balance our investments in long-term growth with margin discipline. And we will update you on that in more detail next quarter. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Murphy of JP Morgan.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much and congratulations on a very strong performance. Olivier, I'm interested in your mention of 2.5% of ARR being driven by the native AI providers. Should we think of that mostly consisting of OpenAI, LLaMA, Anthropic, Coherent, et cetera, or are you meaning that as a slightly different reference? Can you just help us understand, is that up from close to zero a year ago? Then I have a quick follow-up.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, so it's a number of companies that -- without naming anyone, so they tend to be model providers, but not just on the language side, like model providers on the language, image side, like there's a number of different -- or video side, there's a number of different types of companies, even some good copilot type companies. These customers all had revenue one year ago, but they've been growing a little bit faster than the rest of the customer base recently. The reason we should be [indiscernible] in this space is, today we see the usage growth related directly to AI coming mostly for these customers that provide models to others. Whereas we see broad usage of AI functionality across the customer base, but at low volumes. And it corresponds to the fact that for most customers or most enterprises really, they're still in the early stages of developing and shipping AI applications. So for now, the usage is concentrated among the model providers.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. And Olivier, as a quick follow up, you mentioned that log management has crossed $500 million in ARR. It's quite a milestone. You also mentioned the replacement of some legacy products. I'm curious if you see the acquisition of Splunk or any other acquisition activity in that market as a beneficial development. Just wondering if Splunk customers or other companies that have been provided -- that have been acquired \u2013 excuse me, might be looking for any alternatives out there that are more modern and a more converged platform and if you're seeing that in the pipeline.\nOlivier Pomel: We've seen that for a while now that new customers were looking for more integrated platforms, more modern offerings, things that were more cloud-first. And that's been one of the reasons of our success in the landing largely in brand new applications, brand new environments, brand new cloud initiatives, and then over time consolidating our customers away from whatever they were using in the legacy. We don't think that it is going to change with the various acquisitions and tech privates that we've seen over the past quarter. So we think we'll just see more of that over time. One extra thing on your first question, one interesting tidbit if you -- as I know many of you are trying to understand what the AI landscape is made of. Interestingly enough, when we look at our cohort of customers that are considered to be AI native and built largely on AI and [indiscernible] AI providers, they tend to be on different clouds. What we see is that, the majority of these companies actually have a lot of their usage on AWS. Today, the larger part of the usage, the larger of these customers are on Azure. So we see really several different adoption trends there that I think are interesting to the broader market.\nMark Murphy: Thank you for that insight, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions. Olivier, the company has been innovating throughout this downturn quite aggressively across core observability, security, as well as AI. As we look into 2024 and we think about a potential new product cycle for Datadog. What parts of the portfolio do you think could be contributors either in 2024, later in 2024 and in 2025? What are the things that you think the customers will be most receptive to? Just wanted to get a sense of where you think -- where the sort of timing of some of the new products that you've been delivering over the past couple of years?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, mathematically, the products that would contribute the most to the growth next year are going to be the products that have been here the longest and the core observability products. We mentioned $1 billion in infrastructure, $0.5 billion in APM, $0.5 billion in logs. This is great, but still a small fraction of these products can be at scale and we're primarily going after that. There's a number of other things we've been investing in and growing and we're fairly happy with the way things are going in security, as I mentioned on the call, with some new packaging we've also rolled out and some of the new initiatives that stand, I would say, a little bit left or right of what we've been doing in observability. This year, as you mentioned, was a year of innovation for us. I think it was also a year of cost optimization for customers. It's not necessarily the best year to get products to very quick -- extremely quick revenue growth. But we've planted a lot of seeds that we think are going to deliver in the next couple of years.\nSanjit Singh: That's Great. And I had a sort of follow-up question on the sort of new packaging for the DevSecOps, the two new package. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color around why you sort of went with the packaging approach and what you're trying to solve for? Is it sort of trying to adopt the capabilities in a single integrated capability? Or is it also about sort of consolidated pricing, paying potentially one skew price to consume all these capabilities? So just loves some detail around the motivation for these new packages.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, a couple of things. So the first one is, our security products have reached a certain level of maturity, so we think they can be brought into the conversation with a larger set of our customers as opposed to being something that our customers self-select to, which is how we started and how we start with most products really. But also we're trying to bring those products in the same conversation as the initial adoption of DevOps, basically, as opposed to having to branch that conversation into, oh, hey, you're doing operations and applications, and can I interest you in some security with that, which would be a different conversation. So, we -- so far, the signs for this are encouraging, and again, we think it goes with the broader market trends, the adoption of DevSecOps, and what customers actually want to do, and what we think is going to help them deliver better outcomes in security. But obviously, we just rolled that out. So it's still too early to tell whether we got it right or whether we still need to tweak it a little bit.\nSanjit Singh: Appreciate the thoughts, Olivier. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thank you. Congrats from me as well. Olivier, we're almost a year into this kind of current situation and you saw -- Q2, obviously, saw the digital natives that you commented just kind of having extra savings, but we're now back to kind of Q1 usage patterns. What do you see in terms of changing behavior on customers, not thinking [indiscernible], but more like how do you think about observability and how that potentially would change the world as we think about 2024, 2025 coming out of this in terms of vendor consolidation, how to build observability, et cetera. And then I have one follow-up for David. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: So we think the trends of vendor consolidation will continue. So basically customers are getting more sophisticated, more mature in their needs. They're getting further into the cloud and they are, as part of that, they will want to act less as integrators and they can use one platform instead of 12 different products. That's something that they all react very positively to and we see that again and again as we expand into our customers. In terms of the broader trends, I think it's too early to tell exactly what the next couple of quarters are going to be made of. We said it looks like we've hit an inflection point. It looks like there's a lot less overhang now in terms of what needs to be optimized or could be optimized by customers. It looks like also optimization is less intense and less widespread across the customer base, so all that is positive. Now, there's still quite a bit of uncertainty in the macro environment, so I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves either and declare that it's the end of it for the foreseeable future. So we feel positive about things, but it's still hard to know exactly what's going to happen a couple quarters from now. From a buying behavior perspective, we've never seen customers really slow down in their intent to move to the cloud and the rate of adoption of new observability platforms, new products from us. We've done well, we scaled the new logo acquisition, we scaled the new product DASH, so that has been a constant throughout the optimization phase. In terms of the users growth and customers scaling new workloads, I don't think we're back to the exuberant times of 2021, but maybe we're reverting back to the mean of what was happening before that.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, makes sense. And if I can squeeze one quick one in. David, we talked about OpEx and OpEx growth, and this quarter was lower than others. Should I read your comments about next year, and clearly there is a big investment opportunity that OpEx grows like maybe wasn't quite where you wanted it to be. Just any comments there? I know you can't guide.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah, I think as we talked about the movement of the top line because of consumption moves more quickly than we can adjust resources. So we've taken more of an optimization and cost prioritization this year, but we offset it now, we do think there's a very large opportunity. So we are expecting to increase the level of investment. But as we say that, we've always been looking at the balance between maximizing the top line growth with producing profit and are going to continue to operate on that taking advantage of long-term opportunities.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Karl Keirstead of UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks so much. Maybe David, I'll direct this to you. I was intrigued by your comment that the fourth quarter or the month of October was off to a healthy start, understanding that that's just a month. But just curious if you could unpack that a little bit, largely because investors on this call, we are picking up signals from other tech firms that would suggest a still very tough macro environment, or maybe even slightly tougher. So I'm just curious where you might be seeing pockets of strength if you could add a little more color? Thanks so much.\nDavid Obstler: I think it's just essentially what we tried to do in the last couple quarters is to caution everybody that we still expect that there will be continued optimization and cost management but give everyone a flavor for the direction. And what we're seeing, as I think Olivier and I mentioned, we're seeing the continuation of that, but at a more moderated level. And that was across the customer base. So we're seeing essentially clients leaning a little more into growth. Again, early in the quarter, too early to call it, but the trends seem to be a moderation of the previous cost management and optimization, although it's still continuing.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. And just to add color on that. So yes, we had the healthy start to Q4. We see trends that are not as strong as they've been for the past year in terms of what happened early in the quarter. That being said, Q4 is a tough quarter to call because it has fairly high seasonality. There is typically a drop of usage at the very end of the quarter with the holidays. And that drop in different years can be more or less pronounced. Last year in particular it was very pronounced. So we're -- we've given guidance with all that in mind basically.\nDavid Obstler: Let me just add because this question has been talked about. Like last quarter, we didn't take the strength of October into account, we took the exact same guidance approach, which was to take the weighted average historical trends and discount, apply conservativism. So like last quarter, we had said that the first quarter looked a little more stable. We didn't take that into consideration our guidance and we have stuck to the exact same guidance methodology which is to act with that conservatism.\nOlivier Pomel: I want to think too, just to comment on the -- because I know a lot of you are trying to understand how we fit with respect to the large cloud providers and what trends correspond to theirs. Remember that while our trends are similar in the long run, in the short term there can be differences of timing in terms of when we're going to see certain effects, where they're going to see them. We also have a different mix. We have a mix of cloud providers not exactly the same as the border market and a different mix of customers and geographies than the individual cloud providers as well. So things are not exactly one-to-one there.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Very helpful and congrats on the nice results.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys, and I'll offer my congratulations as well. You know, Ollie, I wanted to double-click on some of the improved usage trends. You know, can you provide us with an overview on how some of your large, sort of strategic customers think about optimization as really part of an ongoing IT spending strategy, coupled with what's driving some of this increased usage. I guess I'm wondering, have IT executives from your perspective changed their view on the level of monitoring needed with new levels of workload? No, so they didn't change their view on the level of monitoring needed. I think they tried to save money wherever they could save it. By far the biggest area they can save in their cloud infrastructure is their cloud bill itself. As a reminder, when customers pay $1 to us, they pay $10 or $20 to their cloud provider. So there's a lot more savings to be had there, but these savings flow down to us. We charge commercial rate to the size of our customer infrastructure. They also try to save what they could in the observability specifically. And usually there's always a bit of that you can cut. You can always sample certain things a bit more. You can retain your logs a bit less. You can remove some of the debug log, things like that can drive your costs up, but don't necessarily generate a ton of value. And that's a behavior, by the way, that we see all the time. Like we see it for most customers once a year, maybe twice a year sometimes usually before contract negotiations and things like that where they try to understand what they're going to need for the next two or three years. The big difference over the past year has been that everybody's been doing that at once and multiple times. It was really an environment where everyone was feeling very uncertain about the economy and needed to save money very quickly. So we expect optimization to continue as part of this macro trend in the near future and in perpetuity after that we'll have that continuous cycle of customers optimizing, reducing where they can reduce and then growing workloads and maybe creating a little bit more mess over time as well, and then optimizing again on the regular basis. Not everyone at the same time.\nMatt Hedberg: Super. Thanks a lot guys. Great color, Ollie. Congrats again.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of Citi.\nFatima Boolani: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. One for Ollie and one for Dave, if I may. Olivier, the packaging and pricing motions that you discussed for the DevSecOps solutions that I wanted to zoom out generally a little bit in knowing what you know about how buying behavior and procurement behavior for a lot of your customers has changed over the course of this past year. I was wondering if you can shed light on how you're thinking about an ELA or EAA type selling motion. I know it's something that historically you've been averse to, but I'm curious how you're thinking about it in the current day and age, if you will, in terms of how your customers have changed the way they're buying and deploying. And then for David, just wanted to get a sense of what expectations on net retention rates are built into your guidance. And in other words, should this be the quarter that we see a trough in expansion rates or net retention rates as you're thinking about it in the guidance? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so on the ELA, so in general, look, we're always very open to new approaches in packaging. We try to see how things are consumed from the customer side, what makes the most sense to them. Now, ELA and things like that are very difficult for -- or very inappropriate for a business like ours. One, because we are fully SaaS based and there's a very, very large volume dimension to absolutely everything we do for our customers. So it's very, very hard to provide one price fit all for them. We also, philosophically, we like to have, to get signal from what customers are willing or not willing to pay for, and that drives a lot of our product innovation. We get a lot of good news this way because customers want to buy products and they scale them a lot. We also get bad news. We get customers who don't find there is enough value in a given product or think it should be doing more or think it should be doing things differently or think that the packaging doesn't make sense. And we like to have that. The reason why we simplified the pricing there and we created those new SKUs is really to try and change the motion a little bit and integrate further the validity and the security side and make it easier to bring security into the conversation for these customers. Again, so far we have some early evidence that it seems to resonate, but it's way, way, way too early to call it. We need two, three quarters of that to understand the implications of the new packaging.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah, and as it relates to net retention, we do not provide guidance, but just the way that we think about it and some of the drivers, we don't provide guidance, sorry, on net retention per se. But essentially what we said was that Q3 organic growth was similar to what it was in Q1. And we had said previously that in Q2 and Q3 of last year, we had lower than before but higher than that Q1 -- Q4, Q1, and now Q3. So it really is a matter of lapping those comps. The comps have gotten increasingly easy to lap, and we will let everybody know if we do produce an organic growth that's higher this Q4 than it was in Q4 last year, we will have in this period trough in that retention and it will begin to head up. So that's sort of how we think about it. In terms of our guidance, that's a different story. As we said, we provide conservativism. So what's implicit in the guidance is something worse than we're experiencing, which would apply a lower organic growth. But in terms of the business trends themselves, it's really a matter of do we lap the Q4 and produce a higher organic growth in the Q4 coming up than we had in the Q4 last year.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you. I appreciate the detail.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Good morning. David, I was curious if you could focus on the enterprise traction and what you're seeing, maybe for Olivier. And David, I guess on the customer ad, you're 700, and that's lower than your normal cruise altitude of 1,000 plus per quarter. Can you just talk about is that number being misled because the enterprise traction is higher and that number is therefore going to be lower. Could you just drive into that a little bit? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, as a reminder, we have a broad range of customers with a long tail. And similar to what we discussed last quarter, the gross number of ads, so the accumulation in the enterprise, it was quite strong. It was very similar to what we've experienced. And we have a very small pale that has a large attrition rate but doesn't have a lot of dollars attached to it. So the trends continue, which is very strong, as Olivier mentioned. New logo accumulation, both in terms of number of new logos, [NARR] (ph), and that was true when Olivier talked about the enterprise side of it, offset by this tail that has very little dollars associated with it.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, and just to comment on that, remember the bottom half of our customer represent around 1% of our revenue and the lower increase in customer number comes from the very, very low end, which is customers that pay us in the tens of dollars a month. Those customers, we're getting a little bit less of those to start with. I think that's part of the economic environment and the churn is a little bit higher than it used to be there too. So that's why this number is a little bit depressed right now. That being said, we had a record number of new logos over $100,000. We're doing very well in the enterprise. We're doing very well in the new market. We're also doing very well at the high end of the SMB. So we are very happy with all of the segments we're targeting with our sales and marketing motions today. On the enterprise side, we actually mentioned a few of those very exciting contracts on the call. We get really, really excited when we see very traditional enterprises moving to the cloud and adopting us and concentrating on us in a [indiscernible]. David is there -- we can't see it. In the room David is smiling because he's excited when he sees the dental care companies, he's excited when he sees the network of convenience stores where we even instrument the fuel pumps. So these are great developments for us and we're leaning hard into that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Hello. Thank you very much. Good to see you. I'm sure that you're all smiling at your results. Two things. One is, with respect to LLM monitoring, which was demoed at the DASH conference, which was, I thought, absolutely fascinating. I know you quantified, Ollie, at 2.5 percentage points of growth coming from generative AI workloads. How do we think about the revenue option for LLM monitoring at an early stage? I also have a second question, slightly more controversial. If we run into customers that think they're spending their bills for Datadog or getting to be a little bit on the larger side that is a sign of success, but how do you ensure that that success does not work against the company that it opens up the door for price competition from others. Thank you so much and congrats.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, on the LLM Ops side, I think it's too early to tell how much revenue opportunity there is in the tooling specific to LLM Ops. When you think of the whole spectrum of tools, the closer you get to the developer side, the harder it is to monetize, and the further you get towards operations and infrastructure, the easier it is to monetize. We can ship things that are very useful and very accretive to your platform because they get you a lot of user, a lot of attention, and a lot of stickiness that are harder to monetize. So we'll see where on the spectrum that is. We know though is that the broader generative AI up and down the stack, you know, from the components themselves or the GPUs all the way up to the models and the various things that are used to orchestrate them and store the data and move the data around. All of that is going to generate a lot of opportunity for us. We said right now it's concentrated among the AI native largely model providers, but we see that it's going to broaden and concern a lot more of our customers down the road. And your second question was, so when we grow a lot, we are very successful with some customers. How do we not create a long-term issue where they spend a lot of money and that gets competition? Look, it's a great situation to be in to have customers spend a lot of money on you and have to justify that value over time, I think it's very healthy. I think that -- again, that's what drives innovation and great product development. And our role there is to make sure we have a healthy partnership with customers every single step of the way. And we charge them an order on magnitude less than what they spend for their cloud infrastructure. Maybe two orders of magnitude less than what they spend on their R&D. And so we think we should be in a position of leverage, where if we do our jobs right, we show a lot of value for our customers, we save them a lot of money, we make them a lot faster, and we have them generate a lot more revenue. So that's how we see things and how we hold ourselves to.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe just two quick ones for me. Olivier, you mentioned the federal opportunity or you mentioned the federal activity in the quarter with a deal that was pretty interesting. Is that something that we picked up as an area of excitement for you guys. Can you maybe just talk about what the opportunity there is over the next 12 months and beyond? Maybe stock rank is a priority for you guys? And then I've got a quick follow up.\nOlivier Pomel: So I missed the domain you're talking about.\nDavid Obstler: Fed.\nOlivier Pomel: Oh, Fed. So that's definitely an area of investment for us. It's a -- look, we are happy with two things. Happy with the fact that we're moving further and further into the various level of certifications needed. We're happy with the early success with some agencies where we are spreading and [indiscernible] agencies and now getting to grow some of those world to world. But we're only scratching the surface of what we can do inside. And there's a lot more we need to do. Some of it on the certification side and the product side, and some of it on the go-to-market side and making sure we have all of the parts of the motion working. So I expect that to be one of the main areas of investment on the go-to-market side next year in terms of new markets we're going after.\nKash Rangan: And then maybe on the -- back on the AI question. I guess maybe just drill a little bit deeper within those AI native companies, the criticality of their data guide uses? Meaning, are you seeing something different where in a world where these applications become more prevalent, there's the opportunity to kind of expand wallet share as observability becomes even more important? And how should we think about the growth opportunities from those types of workloads in either 2024 or 2025?\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, so, in general, the more complexity there is, the more useful observability is, the more you shift value from writing code to actually understanding it and observing it. So to caricature, if you spend a whole year writing five lines of code that are really, really deep, you actually know those five lines really well. Maybe you don't know the ability for it because you'll see you understand exactly how they work and what's going on with them. On the other hand, if -- thanks to all the major advances of technology and all of the various open source and AI, and you can just very quickly generate thousands of lines of code, ship them and start operating them, you actually have no idea how these work, what they do, and you'll need a lot of tooling and observability to actually understand that and keep track on that and secure it and do everything you need to do with it all the time. So we think that overall, these increases in productivity are going to favor observability. In terms of the future growth of AI, look, I think, like everyone, we're trying to guess how transformative it's going to be. Looks like it's going to be pretty transformative if you adjust from just internally how much of that technology we are adopting and how much of a productivity impact it seems to be having. So, again, today we're only seeing a tiny, tiny bit of it, which is early adoption by mobile providers and a lot of companies that are trying to scale up and experiment and figure out how it applies to their businesses and what they can ship to use the technology. But we think it's going to drive a lot of growth in the years to come.\nKash Rangan: Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jake Roberge of William Blair.\nJacob Roberge: Hey, thanks for taking the questions and I'll echo my congrats on the great results. Olivier, you called out the 2.5 points from AI native customers a few times, but you've also said that the broader customer base should start adding AI workloads to your platform over time. When do you think that actually takes place in the broader customer base starts to impact that AI growth in more earnest?\nOlivier Pomel: We don't know. And I think it's too early to tell. So for one part, there's some uncertainty in terms of these customers having to figure out what it is they're going to ship to their own customers. I think everybody is trying to learn that right now and experiment it. But the other part is also that right now the innovation is largely concentrated among the mobile providers. And so, it's rational right now for most customers to rely on those instead of deploying their own infrastructure. Again, we think it's likely going to change. We see a lot of demand and interest in other ways to host models and run models and custom models and things like that. But today that's the other trends of the market today basically.\nJacob Roberge: Okay, helpful. And then just to follow up on the optimization front, it sounds like the early optimizers took about a year to complete those initiatives. But what type of timelines are you seeing from kind of the second or third layer of customers that started their optimizations later in the game? Have those also started to stabilize given they weren't as large as the early optimizers, just trying to kind of parse out the customer base there.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, so we don't really know for sure. That's also why we're careful not to go and enter this forever. I would say for customers that are not part of this initial cohort, there's less of an overhang. So the customers that were the early optimizers and that had the most acute optimizations tended to be cloud-native, so all in on the cloud, very heavy on IT spending in general, and substantially all of their IT being in the cloud. These tended to be also companies that were fairly high growth but low profitability that needed to pivot their financials over a fairly short amount of time. I think if you look at the rest of the customer base they're mostly not in that situation. So we expect the behavior to be different.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I would now like to turn it back to CEO, Olivier Pomel for closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you very much. I want to thank everyone for attending the call today. I also want to take a minute to thank our customers for their trust. And we know these are trying times with all the macro uncertainty and we thank them for their trust. I also want to thank our employees, all the Datadog\u2019s for a quarter of hard work and great successes. And on these good words, we'll all get back to work and get busy for the end of the year. So thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution in Q3, as we delivered another quarter of profitable growth and robust new logo bookings, and we continue to broaden our platform to have customers become and grow digital businesses. Let me start with a review of our Q3 financial performance. Revenue was $548 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 26,800 customers, up from about 22,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 3,130 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,600 last year. And these customers generated about 86% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $138 million with a free cash flow margin of 25%. Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q3, 82% of customers were using two or more products, up from 80% a year ago, 46% of customers were using four4 or more products, up from 40% a year ago, and 21% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 16% last year. Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q3, we saw usage growth of existing customers improve compared to Q2. Overall growth in Q3 was relatively consistent throughout the quarter and comparable to levels we've seen in Q1. We are seeing signs that the cloud optimization activity from some of our customers may be moderating. As a reminder, last quarter, we discussed a cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago, and we said that they appear to stabilize their usage growth at the end of Q2. That trend has held for the past several months, with that cohort's usage remaining stable throughout Q3. Overall, we continue to see impact from optimization in our business, but we believe that the intensity and breadth of optimization we've experienced in recent quarters is moderating. Meanwhile, our new logo activity has remained robust. New logo bookings continue to scale and grow year-over-year. And for the second quarter in a row, we closed a record number of new deals with more than $100,000 in annual commitments. With our land and expand model, we expect new logos to turn into much larger customers over time as they lean into the cloud and add up more of our products. Finally, regarding customer growth, we are pleased with the new logos, new workloads, and new product [indiscernible] we added this quarter. We added a number of exciting new customers in Q3, and I'll discuss a couple examples later. Note, that our total customer count is largely driven by our long tail of very small customers, while our sales motions are more targeted to the middle and high end of our prospects. And as a reflection of our team's strong execution, our net ads of customers over $100,000, saw an increase in Q3 compared to Q2. Despite a more cost-conscious demand environment over the past year, our business has continued to grow across product lines, and we are very proud to achieve several key milestones. First, our infrastructure monitoring ARR exceeded $1 billion. Today, our infrastructure products cover monitoring the performance of hosts, networks, containers, Kubernetes deployments, serverless functions, and other aspects of infrastructure in the cloud, as well as a full set of AI and machine learning tools to help our customers separate signal from noise. Second. Our APM suite, which includes core APM, synthetics, real user monitoring and continuous profiler exceeded $500 million in ARR. And we continue to expand our capabilities in APM, most recently with single step instrumentation, which allows a single engineer to enable APM across all applications without code changes and we achieved advances in mobile app monitoring, including mobile application testing and mobile session replay. Third, our log management product exceeded $500 million in ARR. We also continue to expand our capabilities in log management, and with Flex logs, customers can easily scale storage and compute separately, allowing for new and very high-volume logging use cases in a cost-effective manner. From the very beginning, my Co-Founder [Alexi] (ph) and I had a vision to create a unified platform that serves end-to-end use cases across datasets, products, and team boundaries. We believe that these ARR milestones and their balance across the three pillars of observability demonstrate that Datadog is unique within the industry in establishing true platform value for customers. And of course, even though these products have become significant in size, we are only just getting started. We will continue to innovate to deliver more solutions for our customers across observability and beyond. I will add that we have empathy for our customers and their pain points, in part, because we are ourselves users of cloud and next-gen technologies at a meaningful scale. And we extensively deploy a new [indiscernible] solution, which is appropriately known as dog fooding. As an example, we have extensively relied on our cloud cost management product as we expanded its capabilities this past year. And the use of our product has played a large role in delivering cost, performance, and efficiency improvements, optimizing our own cloud usage, and ultimately resulting in expansion of our gross margins in recent quarters. We also continue to innovate in the DevSecOps space. Our recent expansions in cloud security include Cloud Sim investigator, where customers can visualize logs over long periods of time to conduct security investigations. And within our cloud security management product, we have introduced Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management, or CIEM, to help customers prevent identity and access management security issues. For a few years now, the industry has been talking about the idea of DevSecOps, the breaking down of silos among development, operations, and security teams. And we entered the security space on the premise that DevOps and security teams should share the same data in the same platform. So starting this month, we are making the practice of DevSecOps easy to adopt for all customers by bringing together all the components needed to fully monitor and secure their entire stack with two simple packages. First, with infrastructure DevSecOps, our customers can observe and secure their entire cloud environment in one package. With a simple per-host price and a single agent deployed, customers get end-to-end visibility into performance, availability, and security issues in one place. And from that one place, teams can also quickly remediate problems using built-in workflows and without any code or configuration changes. Second, with APM DevSecOps, we take this one step further. Customers can instrument cloud applications for both performance and vulnerability issues in one single package, enabled with the same unified agent used for Infrastructure DevSecOps. APM DevSecOps complements Infrastructure DevSecOps by surfacing open-source and code level security vulnerabilities alongside performance issues. Finally, we continue to be excited about the opportunity in generative AI and large language models. First, we believe adopting next-gen AI will require the use of cloud and other modern technologies and drive additional growth in cloud workloads. So we are continuing to invest by integrating with more components at every layer of the new AI stack and by developing our own LLM observability products. And while we see signs of AI adoption across large parts of our customer base, in the near term, we continue to see AI-related usage manifest itself most accurately with next-gen AI-native customers, who contributed about 2.5% of our ARR this quarter. In the mid to long term, we expect customers of all industries and sizes to keep adding value to their products using AI and to get their early exploration -- to get from early exploration to development and into production, thus driving larger cloud and observability usage across our customer base. Besides observing the AI stack, we also expect to keep adding value to our own platform using AI. Datadog's unified platform and purely SaaS model, combined with strong multi-product adoption by our customers, generates a large amount of deep and precise observability data. We believe combining AI capabilities with this broad data set will allow us to deliver differentiated value to customers. And we are working to productize this differentiated value through recently announced capabilities such as our Bits AI assistant, AI generated synthetic tests, and AI-led error analysis and resolution. And we expect to deliver many more related innovation to customers over time. Let's move on to sales and marketing, where we continue to execute on both new logos and existing customers. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed a seven-figure land over five years with a leading provider of dental care. This company's legacy monitoring just didn't cut, and it contributed to delays with their migration to Azure. What concerned them was that, customers noticed poor application performance and were complaining publicly on social media. By adopting six Datadog products, they expect to find and fix the vast majority of incidents internally before their customers are affected. And in signing a five-year deal, this customer showed its confidence in Datadog as a long-term partner in their migration. Next, we signed a seven-figure land with a South American FinTech company. By moving from basic, built-in cloud monitoring, legacy tooling, and open-source tools to Datadog, this customer expects to significantly reduce costs by spending less on tooling, reducing time to resolution, and giving time back to engineers to innovate on their own products. Next, we signed an eight figure running all over three years with a major American chain of convenience stores. With this expansion, Datadog will bring all aspects of these customers' tech systems into one platform, including their application, hybrid clouds, network, in-store IoT technology, point of sale systems, self-serve kiosks, fuel pumps, and corporate infrastructure. This will free up employee time to focus on customer service with expectations to save millions of dollars annually. This customer plans to use six Datadog's products, replacing three commercial observability tools. Next, we signed a seven-figure expansion with a major US federal agency. When we first started working with this customer a year ago, Datadog was approved for a limited subset of programs. But as we have demonstrated value and gained internal adoption, this customer is now deploying Datadog across the entire agency. They have adopted six Datadog products, and by doing so, consolidated out of seven tools. Next, we found a seven-figure expansion with a Fortune 500 industrial company. Customer was concerned with out of control costs with its legacy log management products and was using a dozen of different tools. And when they began using Datadog, they noticed far fewer support tickets submitted to their reliability team. By growing usage with Datadog and expanding to seven products, this customer expects to deliver better service while saving time and reducing costs. And last, we signed a seven figure expansion with a software business that is part of a tech hyperscaler. This long-time customer has used Datadog for infrastructure metrics and will now expand to adopt seven Datadog products. Datadog will be replacing its commercial APM tool, which wasn't well adopted by its engineers and led to inefficient troubleshooting, outages, and revenue impact. Our support of OpenTelemetry in particular was key to their decision to expand with Datadog as it makes it possible for APM tracing to be democratized and used across their entire DevOps team. And that's it for this quarter's highlight. I'd like to thank our go to market teams for their strong execution in Q3. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, let me reiterate our longer term outlook. As we have said throughout this period of cloud optimization and macro uncertainty, our long-term plans have remained unchanged. We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business and critical motions for every company to deliver value and competitive advantage. So we continue to invest aggressively to broaden our platform and we aim -- sorry, and we aim to be our customers mission critical partners as we move to cloud and to modern DevSecOps. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, David. Yeah, so it's a number of companies that -- without naming anyone, so they tend to be model providers, but not just on the language side, like model providers on the language, image side, like there's a number of different -- or video side, there's a number of different types of companies, even some good copilot type companies. These customers all had revenue one year ago, but they've been growing a little bit faster than the rest of the customer base recently. The reason we should be [indiscernible] in this space is, today we see the usage growth related directly to AI coming mostly for these customers that provide models to others. Whereas we see broad usage of AI functionality across the customer base, but at low volumes. And it corresponds to the fact that for most customers or most enterprises really, they're still in the early stages of developing and shipping AI applications. So for now, the usage is concentrated among the model providers. We've seen that for a while now that new customers were looking for more integrated platforms, more modern offerings, things that were more cloud-first. And that's been one of the reasons of our success in the landing largely in brand new applications, brand new environments, brand new cloud initiatives, and then over time consolidating our customers away from whatever they were using in the legacy. We don't think that it is going to change with the various acquisitions and tech privates that we've seen over the past quarter. So we think we'll just see more of that over time. One extra thing on your first question, one interesting tidbit if you -- as I know many of you are trying to understand what the AI landscape is made of. Interestingly enough, when we look at our cohort of customers that are considered to be AI native and built largely on AI and [indiscernible] AI providers, they tend to be on different clouds. What we see is that, the majority of these companies actually have a lot of their usage on AWS. Today, the larger part of the usage, the larger of these customers are on Azure. So we see really several different adoption trends there that I think are interesting to the broader market. Well, mathematically, the products that would contribute the most to the growth next year are going to be the products that have been here the longest and the core observability products. We mentioned $1 billion in infrastructure, $0.5 billion in APM, $0.5 billion in logs. This is great, but still a small fraction of these products can be at scale and we're primarily going after that. There's a number of other things we've been investing in and growing and we're fairly happy with the way things are going in security, as I mentioned on the call, with some new packaging we've also rolled out and some of the new initiatives that stand, I would say, a little bit left or right of what we've been doing in observability. This year, as you mentioned, was a year of innovation for us. I think it was also a year of cost optimization for customers. It's not necessarily the best year to get products to very quick -- extremely quick revenue growth. But we've planted a lot of seeds that we think are going to deliver in the next couple of years. Yes, a couple of things. So the first one is, our security products have reached a certain level of maturity, so we think they can be brought into the conversation with a larger set of our customers as opposed to being something that our customers self-select to, which is how we started and how we start with most products really. But also we're trying to bring those products in the same conversation as the initial adoption of DevOps, basically, as opposed to having to branch that conversation into, oh, hey, you're doing operations and applications, and can I interest you in some security with that, which would be a different conversation. So, we -- so far, the signs for this are encouraging, and again, we think it goes with the broader market trends, the adoption of DevSecOps, and what customers actually want to do, and what we think is going to help them deliver better outcomes in security. But obviously, we just rolled that out. So it's still too early to tell whether we got it right or whether we still need to tweak it a little bit. So we think the trends of vendor consolidation will continue. So basically customers are getting more sophisticated, more mature in their needs. They're getting further into the cloud and they are, as part of that, they will want to act less as integrators and they can use one platform instead of 12 different products. That's something that they all react very positively to and we see that again and again as we expand into our customers. In terms of the broader trends, I think it's too early to tell exactly what the next couple of quarters are going to be made of. We said it looks like we've hit an inflection point. It looks like there's a lot less overhang now in terms of what needs to be optimized or could be optimized by customers. It looks like also optimization is less intense and less widespread across the customer base, so all that is positive. Now, there's still quite a bit of uncertainty in the macro environment, so I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves either and declare that it's the end of it for the foreseeable future. So we feel positive about things, but it's still hard to know exactly what's going to happen a couple quarters from now. From a buying behavior perspective, we've never seen customers really slow down in their intent to move to the cloud and the rate of adoption of new observability platforms, new products from us. We've done well, we scaled the new logo acquisition, we scaled the new product DASH, so that has been a constant throughout the optimization phase. In terms of the users growth and customers scaling new workloads, I don't think we're back to the exuberant times of 2021, but maybe we're reverting back to the mean of what was happening before that. Yes. And just to add color on that. So yes, we had the healthy start to Q4. We see trends that are not as strong as they've been for the past year in terms of what happened early in the quarter. That being said, Q4 is a tough quarter to call because it has fairly high seasonality. There is typically a drop of usage at the very end of the quarter with the holidays. And that drop in different years can be more or less pronounced. Last year in particular it was very pronounced. So we're -- we've given guidance with all that in mind basically. I want to think too, just to comment on the -- because I know a lot of you are trying to understand how we fit with respect to the large cloud providers and what trends correspond to theirs. Remember that while our trends are similar in the long run, in the short term there can be differences of timing in terms of when we're going to see certain effects, where they're going to see them. We also have a different mix. We have a mix of cloud providers not exactly the same as the border market and a different mix of customers and geographies than the individual cloud providers as well. So things are not exactly one-to-one there. Thank you. Yes, so on the ELA, so in general, look, we're always very open to new approaches in packaging. We try to see how things are consumed from the customer side, what makes the most sense to them. Now, ELA and things like that are very difficult for -- or very inappropriate for a business like ours. One, because we are fully SaaS based and there's a very, very large volume dimension to absolutely everything we do for our customers. So it's very, very hard to provide one price fit all for them. We also, philosophically, we like to have, to get signal from what customers are willing or not willing to pay for, and that drives a lot of our product innovation. We get a lot of good news this way because customers want to buy products and they scale them a lot. We also get bad news. We get customers who don't find there is enough value in a given product or think it should be doing more or think it should be doing things differently or think that the packaging doesn't make sense. And we like to have that. The reason why we simplified the pricing there and we created those new SKUs is really to try and change the motion a little bit and integrate further the validity and the security side and make it easier to bring security into the conversation for these customers. Again, so far we have some early evidence that it seems to resonate, but it's way, way, way too early to call it. We need two, three quarters of that to understand the implications of the new packaging. Yeah, as a reminder, we have a broad range of customers with a long tail. And similar to what we discussed last quarter, the gross number of ads, so the accumulation in the enterprise, it was quite strong. It was very similar to what we've experienced. And we have a very small pale that has a large attrition rate but doesn't have a lot of dollars attached to it. So the trends continue, which is very strong, as Olivier mentioned. New logo accumulation, both in terms of number of new logos, [NARR] (ph), and that was true when Olivier talked about the enterprise side of it, offset by this tail that has very little dollars associated with it. Yeah, and just to comment on that, remember the bottom half of our customer represent around 1% of our revenue and the lower increase in customer number comes from the very, very low end, which is customers that pay us in the tens of dollars a month. Those customers, we're getting a little bit less of those to start with. I think that's part of the economic environment and the churn is a little bit higher than it used to be there too. So that's why this number is a little bit depressed right now. That being said, we had a record number of new logos over $100,000. We're doing very well in the enterprise. We're doing very well in the new market. We're also doing very well at the high end of the SMB. So we are very happy with all of the segments we're targeting with our sales and marketing motions today. On the enterprise side, we actually mentioned a few of those very exciting contracts on the call. We get really, really excited when we see very traditional enterprises moving to the cloud and adopting us and concentrating on us in a [indiscernible]. David is there -- we can't see it. In the room David is smiling because he's excited when he sees the dental care companies, he's excited when he sees the network of convenience stores where we even instrument the fuel pumps. So these are great developments for us and we're leaning hard into that. Yes, on the LLM Ops side, I think it's too early to tell how much revenue opportunity there is in the tooling specific to LLM Ops. When you think of the whole spectrum of tools, the closer you get to the developer side, the harder it is to monetize, and the further you get towards operations and infrastructure, the easier it is to monetize. We can ship things that are very useful and very accretive to your platform because they get you a lot of user, a lot of attention, and a lot of stickiness that are harder to monetize. So we'll see where on the spectrum that is. We know though is that the broader generative AI up and down the stack, you know, from the components themselves or the GPUs all the way up to the models and the various things that are used to orchestrate them and store the data and move the data around. All of that is going to generate a lot of opportunity for us. We said right now it's concentrated among the AI native largely model providers, but we see that it's going to broaden and concern a lot more of our customers down the road. And your second question was, so when we grow a lot, we are very successful with some customers. How do we not create a long-term issue where they spend a lot of money and that gets competition? Look, it's a great situation to be in to have customers spend a lot of money on you and have to justify that value over time, I think it's very healthy. I think that -- again, that's what drives innovation and great product development. And our role there is to make sure we have a healthy partnership with customers every single step of the way. And we charge them an order on magnitude less than what they spend for their cloud infrastructure. Maybe two orders of magnitude less than what they spend on their R&D. And so we think we should be in a position of leverage, where if we do our jobs right, we show a lot of value for our customers, we save them a lot of money, we make them a lot faster, and we have them generate a lot more revenue. So that's how we see things and how we hold ourselves to. So I missed the domain you're talking about. Oh, Fed. So that's definitely an area of investment for us. It's a -- look, we are happy with two things. Happy with the fact that we're moving further and further into the various level of certifications needed. We're happy with the early success with some agencies where we are spreading and [indiscernible] agencies and now getting to grow some of those world to world. But we're only scratching the surface of what we can do inside. And there's a lot more we need to do. Some of it on the certification side and the product side, and some of it on the go-to-market side and making sure we have all of the parts of the motion working. So I expect that to be one of the main areas of investment on the go-to-market side next year in terms of new markets we're going after. Yeah, so, in general, the more complexity there is, the more useful observability is, the more you shift value from writing code to actually understanding it and observing it. So to caricature, if you spend a whole year writing five lines of code that are really, really deep, you actually know those five lines really well. Maybe you don't know the ability for it because you'll see you understand exactly how they work and what's going on with them. On the other hand, if -- thanks to all the major advances of technology and all of the various open source and AI, and you can just very quickly generate thousands of lines of code, ship them and start operating them, you actually have no idea how these work, what they do, and you'll need a lot of tooling and observability to actually understand that and keep track on that and secure it and do everything you need to do with it all the time. So we think that overall, these increases in productivity are going to favor observability. In terms of the future growth of AI, look, I think, like everyone, we're trying to guess how transformative it's going to be. Looks like it's going to be pretty transformative if you adjust from just internally how much of that technology we are adopting and how much of a productivity impact it seems to be having. So, again, today we're only seeing a tiny, tiny bit of it, which is early adoption by mobile providers and a lot of companies that are trying to scale up and experiment and figure out how it applies to their businesses and what they can ship to use the technology. But we think it's going to drive a lot of growth in the years to come. We don't know. And I think it's too early to tell. So for one part, there's some uncertainty in terms of these customers having to figure out what it is they're going to ship to their own customers. I think everybody is trying to learn that right now and experiment it. But the other part is also that right now the innovation is largely concentrated among the mobile providers. And so, it's rational right now for most customers to rely on those instead of deploying their own infrastructure. Again, we think it's likely going to change. We see a lot of demand and interest in other ways to host models and run models and custom models and things like that. But today that's the other trends of the market today basically. Yeah, so we don't really know for sure. That's also why we're careful not to go and enter this forever. I would say for customers that are not part of this initial cohort, there's less of an overhang. So the customers that were the early optimizers and that had the most acute optimizations tended to be cloud-native, so all in on the cloud, very heavy on IT spending in general, and substantially all of their IT being in the cloud. These tended to be also companies that were fairly high growth but low profitability that needed to pivot their financials over a fairly short amount of time. I think if you look at the rest of the customer base they're mostly not in that situation. So we expect the behavior to be different. Thank you very much. I want to thank everyone for attending the call today. I also want to take a minute to thank our customers for their trust. And we know these are trying times with all the macro uncertainty and we thank them for their trust. I also want to thank our employees, all the Datadog's for a quarter of hard work and great successes. And on these good words, we'll all get back to work and get busy for the end of the year. So thank you very much."

            "name": "David Obstler",
            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. Q3 revenue was $548 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of this Q3 performance, first regarding usage growth. We saw an improvement in usage growth in Q3 versus Q2. The Q3 usage growth was more similar to Q1 and relatively steady throughout the quarter. We had a very healthy start to Q4 in October. While it is too early in the quarter to know for sure what will happen in the next couple of months, the trends we see in early Q4 are stronger than they've been for the past year. Regarding usage growth by customer size, we continue to see larger spending customer growth at a slower rate than smaller spending customers, but usage growth improved for all customer sizes in Q3 relative to Q2. And as Olivier discussed, we believe there are signs that the optimization activity we've been seeing is moderating. Last quarter, we discussed the cohort of customers who started optimizing about a year ago. This cohorts usage has been stable -- was stable throughout Q3. As we look at our overall customer activity, we continue to see customers optimizing, but with less impact than we experienced in Q2, contributing to our usage growth with existing customers improving in Q3 relative to Q2. While we expect cost management to continue, we believe we are seeing moderation that is still present, but is less intense and less widespread than we experienced in recent quarters. Geographically, we experienced similar sequential revenue growth in North America and in our international markets. And finally, as regard to retention metrics, our trailing 12 month net revenue retention was in line with our expectations and came in slightly below 120% in Q3. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid to high 90s, a sign of the mission critical nature of our platform for our customers. Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $607 million up 30% year-over-year. Billings duration increased slightly year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO, was $1.45 billion, up 54% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was about 30% year-over-year. Over the past couple of quarters, we have seen an increasing preference from our customers to sign multi-year deals, and our weighted average booking duration was up sequentially and year-over-year. We see continued interest in multi-year duration deals in our pipeline as customers seek longer term strategic partnerships with us. We continue to believe that revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO, as those can fluctuate relative to revenues based on the timing of invoice and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $451 million, representing a gross margin of 82.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 81.3% last quarter and 79.7% in the year ago quarter. As Olivier mentioned, we continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold in the quarter, as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency projects. Our Q3 OpEx grew 17% year-over-year, this is a decline from 26% year-over-year growth last quarter. We continued to execute on controlling costs given the uncertain environment. And Q3 operating income was $131 million for a 24% operating margin, up from 21% last quarter and above the 17% in the year-ago quarter. Our margins were higher than we expected in Q3 as our organic growth was higher than in Q2, while our internal optimization and cost management efforts were successful. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. And cash flow from operations was $153 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $138 million for a free cash flow margin of 25%. And now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2023. A reminder, our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. We base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservativism on these growth trends. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $564 million to $568 million, which represents about 20% to 21% growth year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $129 million to $133 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.42 to $0.44 per share, based on approximately 355 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.103 billion to $2.107 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $453 million to $457 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.52 to $1.54 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Some additional notes for our guidance. First, we expect net interest income and net interest and other income for fiscal 2023 to be approximately $95 million. We expect tax expense in the fiscal year to be $12 million to $14 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range in fiscal 2023. And now regarding 2024. It is too early for us to speak to 2024 revenue growth. We will digest the information we see over the next several months and give you our 2024 revenue guidance next quarter. As it relates to non-GAAP profitability, our operating income and margins were a little higher in Q3 than we targeted, as usage growth improved from Q2 levels and we were successful with our cost efficiencies. We expect continued strong execution on profitability in Q4. At the same time, we continue to be excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities, and we have no shortage of investments to make and are confident in our ability to execute to strong ROI on those investments. As a result, while we are not providing 2024 margin guidance at this point, as always, we will balance our investments in long-term growth with margin discipline. And we will update you on that in more detail next quarter. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yeah, I think as we talked about the movement of the top line because of consumption moves more quickly than we can adjust resources. So we've taken more of an optimization and cost prioritization this year, but we offset it now, we do think there's a very large opportunity. So we are expecting to increase the level of investment. But as we say that, we've always been looking at the balance between maximizing the top line growth with producing profit and are going to continue to operate on that taking advantage of long-term opportunities. Thanks. I think it's just essentially what we tried to do in the last couple quarters is to caution everybody that we still expect that there will be continued optimization and cost management but give everyone a flavor for the direction. And what we're seeing, as I think Olivier and I mentioned, we're seeing the continuation of that, but at a more moderated level. And that was across the customer base. So we're seeing essentially clients leaning a little more into growth. Again, early in the quarter, too early to call it, but the trends seem to be a moderation of the previous cost management and optimization, although it's still continuing. Let me just add because this question has been talked about. Like last quarter, we didn't take the strength of October into account, we took the exact same guidance approach, which was to take the weighted average historical trends and discount, apply conservativism. So like last quarter, we had said that the first quarter looked a little more stable. We didn't take that into consideration our guidance and we have stuck to the exact same guidance methodology which is to act with that conservatism. Yeah, and as it relates to net retention, we do not provide guidance, but just the way that we think about it and some of the drivers, we don't provide guidance, sorry, on net retention per se. But essentially what we said was that Q3 organic growth was similar to what it was in Q1. And we had said previously that in Q2 and Q3 of last year, we had lower than before but higher than that Q1 -- Q4, Q1, and now Q3. So it really is a matter of lapping those comps. The comps have gotten increasingly easy to lap, and we will let everybody know if we do produce an organic growth that's higher this Q4 than it was in Q4 last year, we will have in this period trough in that retention and it will begin to head up. So that's sort of how we think about it. In terms of our guidance, that's a different story. As we said, we provide conservativism. So what's implicit in the guidance is something worse than we're experiencing, which would apply a lower organic growth. But in terms of the business trends themselves, it's really a matter of do we lap the Q4 and produce a higher organic growth in the Q4 coming up than we had in the Q4 last year. Fed."

Our team continued to execute well in Q2 as we welcome thousands of attendees at our Dashes conference last week. We continue to deliver a large number of new product innovations and we recorded strong new logo bookings throughout the quarter. Let me start with a review of our Q2 financial performance. Revenue was $509 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high-end of our guidance range. We ended with about 26,100 customers, up from about 21,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 2,990 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,420 last year. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR, and we generated free cash flow of $142 million, with a free cash flow margin of 28%. Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. At a high level, first, we saw Q2 usage growth for existing customers that was a bit lower than it had been in previous quarters. Second, we do see signs that cloud optimization may start to subside. And third, we continue scaling our sales with strong new logo bookings in Q2. Going one-level deeper. In Q2, we saw usage growth for existing customers that was a bit lower than it had been in previous quarters. We continue to see customers, particularly some larger spending customers, scrutinize costs and optimize their cloud and observability usage during Q2. We are reflecting this lower growth in our updated guidance for 2023, and David will provide more commentary regarding our guidance geography. On the other hand, we are seeing signs that the cloud optimization across our customer base may start to subside. The cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago appear to have stabilized the users growth at the end of Q2, as indicated by the recent activity and the related commitments with us. And we saw usage growth in aggregates rebound in July to levels that are more similar to what we see in Q1. While it is too early to call an end to cloud optimization and a significant level of macro uncertainty remains, these new trends, along with the tenor of our customer interactions are encouraging. Lastly, our bookings were strong in Q2. Our new logo and new product bookings and deal cycles haven't been impacted by the period of cloud optimization and we continue to see healthy growth on the sales side. From a new logo bookings perspective, we had our largest Q2 and second largest quarter ever, only behind the seasonally larger Q4 2022. We also closed a record number of new business deals larger than $100,000 in annual commitment. And with our land extend model, we expect new logos to turn into much larger customers over time as they lead into the cloud, and add up more of our product. So as a conclusion, while we do apply conservatism to our guidance, recent usage trends as well as strong new logo activity and customer ramp-ups are positive signs for our future growth. Now turning to platform adoption. Q2 metrics show that our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 82% of customers were using two or more products, up from 79% a year ago. 45% of customers were using four or more products, up from 37% a year ago, and 21% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 14% a year ago. The strong multiproduct adoption include expansion into our new newest products. About 30% of our customers have already adopted at least one of our products launched since 2021, including CI visibility database monitoring, cloud security management, sensitive data scanner, cloud craft and others. We expect more opportunities to expand adoption of these products as we continue to broaden their capabilities over time. In Securities, we mentioned last quarter that over 5,000 customers have adopted security products. While many of these 5,000 are just getting started with Datadog Security, we are seeing opportunities to help customers secure their cloud at scale. As of Q2, 79 of our customers spent more than $100,000 on Datadog Security and a handful are now spending more than $1 million. Now let's move on to R&D. Last week, we had our DASH User Conference and introduced a number of exciting new products and features for our users. To kick off our keynote, we launched our first innovation for generative AI and large language model. We showcased our LLM observability product, enabling ML engineers to safely deploy and manage the models in production. This includes the model catalog centralized place to view and manage every model in every state of our customer development pipeline; analysis and insight on model performance, which allows all engineers to identify and address performance and quality issue with the model themselves; and help identify model drift, the performance degradation that happens over time as model interact with real-world data. We also introduced Bits AI. Bits understands natural language and provide insights from across the Datadog platform as well as from our customers' collaboration and documentation tools. Among its many features, Bits AI can act as an incident management copilot identifying and suggesting success, generating synthetic tests and triggering workflows to automatically remediate critical issue. And we announced 15 new integrations across the next-generation AI stack from GPU infrastructure providers to Vector databases, module vendors and AR orchestration frameworks. As we said last quarter, we are excited about these new AI technologies, and we believe Datadog is uniquely positioned to both help our customers make the best of them as well as to incorporate them into our product alongside our data and workloads. And although, it's early days for everyone in this space, we are getting traction with AI customers. And in Q2, our next-gen AI customers contributed about 2% of ARR. Moving on from AI. We showcased a number of new capabilities in the observability space. We introduced Flex logs for log management, allowing customers to flexibly choose retention periods and required performance separately to make new high-volume million use cases cost-effective. We are simplifying APM onboarding for large organizations, so engineers can enable APM across all applications without any core changes. With APM trade squaring, our customers can now understand the complete impact of any localized issue. We introduced our Error Tracking Assistant, which manages AI capabilities with live observability data to automatically explain, solve and test for production errors. In digital experience, we're also applying next-gen AI technologies to help customers automatically generate synthetic tests from their live traffic data. And we have expanded our mobile monitoring features bringing a first-class experience for mobile developer teams with mobile session replay and mobile application testing. We also announced several innovations in cloud security. Our new security inbox surfaces the most pressing security issues, correlating thousands of technical insights and reducing them to a smaller number of actionable tasks. We can now expect more infrastructure vulnerabilities, whether they are in applications, container images as our hosts. With custom code venerability detection, we extended our detection capabilities beyond auto [indiscernible] and into customers on code identifying the exact vulnerable code mixed feedback with the majority in detail. And with Cloud Sim investigator, our customers can visually map an attacker's behavior going back more than a year, leading to faster investigation and remediation. Shifting left, we're delivering more solutions to developers with static analysis. Customers can scan code for quality issues directly within Datadog and we are introducing quality gates for engineers can set rules and prevent e-secure, buggy or slow code from deploying production. Finally, we announced new capabilities to help customers spend on property to receive more efficiently. Our container resource utilization functionality makes it clear which applications are under or over provisioned. And with cloud cost recommendations, we're adding to our cloud cost management product to automatically discover saving opportunities and act on them. Those were just some of the many announcements we made at DASH. Our Investor Relations website includes a link to the DASH keynote, and I encourage you to watch it to learn more. Before I step away from more innovation, I'm also pleased to note that for the third year in a row, Datadog has been named the leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and Observability. We believe this validates our approach to deliver unified platform, which breaks on silos across teams and to focus intensely on product innovation. Now let's move on to sales and marketing. As I said earlier, we recorded strong new logo bookings, and we continue to see significant expansion opportunities with existing customers. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed an eight-figure deal over three years with a major American video games company. These customers' previous SaaS observability vendor was not delivering on critical capabilities such as quality alerting and collaborative incident management and a recent pricing change motivated to get some rich consider other vendors. By moving to Datadog, this customer expects to get higher value out of their monitoring, produce [indiscernible] and eliminate silos among users. And as we achieve better results, they expect to save over $1 million annually by shifting to Datadog from their previous vendor. Next, we signed a seven-figure land with a major broadcaster. This customer is moving to AWS and serverless and its fragmented legacy in open-source tools meet longer incident resolution times and confusion among teams. This customer is developing seven Datadog products, consolidating five tools and has already ramped Datadog to over 500 users. Next, we signed a seven-figure land with a leading Japanese toys and media company. This company has been using a competitive observability vendor alongside smaller tools and home-grown capabilities. With the adoption of five Datadog products, they have full visibility into their applications. They can save time on the busy work and focus on delivering great experiences for their customers. Next, we signed a seven-figure expansion with one of the world's largest tech companies. This customer is seeing massive adoption of its new generative AI product and needs to scale their GPU fleet to meet increasing demand for AI workload. Using their home-grown tools were slowing them down and put at risk critical product launches. With Datadog, this team is able to programmatically manage new environments as they come online, track and alert on their service level objectives and provide real-time visibility for [indiscernible]. Last but not least, we signed an expansion with one of the world's largest financial institutions, taking this customer to eight-figure ARR. This customer operates at massive scale, supporting thousands of applications run by tens of thousands of developers and we have a strategic initiative to move aggressively to the public cloud this year. They chose Datadog as their preferred observability platform for cloud application. And as their business units modernize, they are expanding to 10 Datadog products and replacing a number of legacy commercial tools and that is for this quarter's highlights. I'd like to thank our go-to-market team for their execution in Q2 and for helping our customers make the most out of Dash last week. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, let me speak to our longer-term outlook. Despite the recent trends of product optimization and continued macro uncertainty, our posture remains the same. We are confident in our long-term growth opportunities, driven by the secular trends of cloud migration and digital transformation as well as our rapid pace of innovation to set customers in observability and beyond. And we think our strong new logo and product adoption trends this quarter are indicative of the continued large and growing opportunity for Datadog. So our long-term plans have not changed. We are continuing to invest to serve our customers as they move to the cloud, AI and other modern technologies. With that, let me turn it over to our CFO. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. Q2 revenues was $509 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. In Q2, we continued to execute solidly and we also continue to see pressure on the usage growth of existing customers. To dive into some of the drivers of Q2 performance. First, as to usage growth of existing customers, we saw positive usage growth this quarter to lower than in recent quarters, with broadly similar trends across our product lines. While too early to draw broad conclusions, existing customer usage growth improved in July and was more similar to Q1 than that of Q2. We saw more pressure on cloud native businesses than traditional enterprise customers, similar to previous quarters. Regarding customers by spending size, the more moderate growth trends were consistent across the customer base with relatively more pressure on usage growth rates with larger customers. As Olivier discussed, the cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago, appear to have stabilized their usage growth with Datadog, though, we recognize that the growth rates of these optimizing customers may remain muted and other customers could optimize. Regarding total customers. Our customer count increased to 26,100 from 25,500 last quarter. This quarter's total paying customer count includes a one-time cleanup of about 200 financially immaterial customers at the very low end, who are moved to our free tier. Our gross customer additions have remained strong, especially with larger customers. Meanwhile, we are seeing some churn of smaller customers who have limited impact on our revenues. As a result, our gross revenue retention rate remains unchanged in the mid to high 90s, indicating the stickiness of our product and the importance of our product to our customers' operations. We are executing on strong new logo bookings and new customers contributing meaningfully to our growth as they ramp up. As Olivier mentioned, we had our second largest new logo bookings quarter and a record for Q2. We expect these customers to become more meaningful as they expand with us. In Q2, about 40% of our year-over-year revenue growth or 10 points of growth was attributable to growth from these new customers that were acquired in the past year. Finally, we continue to see consolidation opportunities, particularly in larger deals. Consolidation allows our customers to improve functionality by getting all of their data into one platform, while saving money at the same time. Moving on to our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate, or NRR. NRR was over 120% in Q2 as customers increased their usage and adopted more products. As we expected and as we discussed on last quarter's call, our trailing 12-month NRR decline but was above 120 in Q2 as existing customers continue to scrutinize their tech stack costs and make efficiency improvements. If our growth trajectory continues at current levels, we expect our trailing 12-month NRR to decline to below 120 in Q3. Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $520 million in the quarter, up 31% year-over-year. Billings duration increased slightly year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO was $1.25 billion, up 42% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was about up 30% year-over-year. We signed some larger multiyear deals in the quarter, which drove an increase in the duration year-over-year. As we've mentioned before, we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $414 million, representing a gross margin of 81.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.5% last quarter and 80.8% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. As a result, we are experiencing a gross margin, which is in excess of our target in the high 70s. Our Q2 OpEx grew 26% year-over-year, and this was a decline from 45% year-over-year growth last quarter. We moderated our hiring pace and executed on controlling costs, given the macro uncertainties. Q2 operating income was $106 million, or a 21% operating margin, up from 18% last quarter and flat to 21% in the year ago quarter. We are pleased with our execution on cost control and disciplined investment in this quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash from operations was $153 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $142 million for a free cash flow margin of 28%. Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the usage growth of our existing customers. As a reminder, our guidance philosophy is to carry forward trends observed in recent quarters, discounted with additional conservative. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $521 million to $525 million, which represents a 19% to 20% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $98 million to $102 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.35 per share based on approximately 354 weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion, which represents 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $390 million to $400 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.30 to $0.34 per share and based on approximately 351 million average sales diluted shares outstanding. Now finally, for some additional notes on the guidance. We have continued to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large long-term opportunities, and we are executing well on our plans to invest efficiently. Next, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $85 million and we expect our tax expense for the full year to be $14 million to $16 million. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be about 4% of revenues in fiscal year 2023. To reiterate Olivier's comments, we remain excited about our long-term growth opportunities and we're continuing to execute against those opportunities. I want to thank our Datadog worldwide for our efforts in this quarter. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thank you. Olivier, on the -- if you think about the niche, can you discuss a little bit in the nature (ph) of the optimizations that you see when you compare a little bit what you saw at the early parts of the -- after recession or the cycle late last year versus what you see now. Does the nature has changed there in terms of what you're seeing there? And then I have one follow-up, David.\nOlivier Pomel: No, we don't see a big change in the nature of the optimization, it's a mix of a optimization of the cloud workloads themselves and little bit also on the observability side for the new (ph) products that have volume that can be separate from the cloud workloads, such as log from metrics and things like that. I would say, so this quarter we did see a little bit lower growth as we said in the comments across the board from existing customers. We suggest that the customers have started optimizing earlier, we're not done yet and some others have started later and they all across many are (ph) there. We did see, however, that some of the customers in the course of customers and but you're going to stay optimizing a year ago and that we're on the larger side and on the primary side has stabilized their growth. And we feel a lot more confident now that they've done at least as far as they know. As we've seen some of these customers start committing long-term forward again with us and at levels that are at or above their current levels of usage, which suggest that you have a good idea of what is going next, which is all inspired -- part of what you for your comments about the -- fact that we think we might we see some signs that the this period by end. Still too early to call it, but we see some -- we seem to be on more solid ground there.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay. And then just linking that up with the guidance because that's where I get a lot of the questions, you think about your Q3 and then Q4 implied guidance, even given that you had a full year there's obviously still headwinds on growth that are kind of coming there. Like how much of that Q3, Q4 is kind of a lagging effect of what we've seen before versus kind of maybe other factors like conservatism, et cetera.? Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah, it's both. Because our growth was a little lower than in Q2 than it had been in the previous quarters. We have that effect moving forward given our recurring revenue model. And then on top of that, we -- in our guidance philosophy, we discount the most recent performance, particularly around usage growth, but also in new logos. So it\u2019s a combination of both of that, those flowing through in our financial results for the year.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Thanks, guys for taking the question. I think I understand the comments around slower usage growth trends, particularly compared to Q1. I just wanted to dig into sort of issues around competition. David, you mentioned sort of higher churn at low end. We see total customer count growth slow down this quarter. So we think of about either [indiscernible] competition, competition with open source or DIY or maybe even customers rather than getting to hyperscale or needed solutions. Has it seen any sort of pick up there? And is that a potential as part of the mix of why we're seeing slower usage trends this quarter?\nOlivier Pomel: Sanjit, you're breaking up a little bit. So I hope I answered your question appropriately, but the -- we do see a slightly higher return at the very, very low end. This is more related to the health of what happens to tiny, tiny businesses that use us for small amounts and that themselves might disappear go out of business or start having needle together. We did have a onetime cleanup also this quarter as we -- on an ongoing basis, we don't create some customers if they are not super active in the platform or if they are deals are out -- are not paid up today. We changed some of the criteria around that, which ended up with a onetime cleanup of 200 customers, which changed a number there. But beyond that, we do see a little bit higher churn at the very, very low end. The numbers there are small in terms of revenue. They're actually completely material and the overall gross retention remains unchanged and in the mid to high 90s in aggregate.\nDavid Obstler: We said that -- I think on the other side of it, we said that in dollars, we had a strong new logo bookings and also cross-sell. And a lot of that, as I said in my comments, or a portion of that tends to be consolidation onto the platform, which has been going on a long time.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. And beyond that, I think it's a good point, David, we do see -- we're actually very happy with what we see on the new product and new logos out of the business. We're lending record numbers of new customers of scale and we're also seeing more and more consolidation on to us. If nothing else, the committee dynamics seems to turn more into our favor as time goes by there, independently from what we see in terms of churn or go to very end (ph).\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the color. And then David and Olivier, you made some sort of, I guess, preliminary comments of potentially seeing some green shoots on the optimization headwinds that we've seen over the last several quarters. In terms of the percentage of the base that hasn't optimized, any sort of color how large that is? What percentage of the customer base hasn't yet optimized but potentially could going forward?\nOlivier Pomel: We can't really give you a percentage there. But the cohort we mentioned on the call was the one we were looking at for getting a sense of stabilization in the optimization was the cohort that started optimizing the first that was typically large in volume, very cloud-native in nature and that we consider to be the highest risk one. So the one that weighed on our growth numbers, the most over the past few quarters and that's the one we based on a lot of comment on. In addition to the other trends that David mentioned earlier, on the fact that in aggregate, we saw our growth of existing customers pick up first late in Q2 and then in July.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the color, Olivier. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much. Once the larger customers have compressor spending, and obviously, there's a limit to how much they can compress that. Then they're going to need to grow that spending again. And at some point, you're going to have growth ramping pretty materially in security. It sounds like that has started and all of the LLM observability. And then you're going to have easier comparisons as we head into 2024. Is it reasonable to think that optimizations could be further subsiding as you're entering 2024 based on your comments. And then for all these reasons, should we be optimistic on growth picking up just relative to how it's going to exit in Q4 of this year, which I think is around -- which I think is around the mid-teens. And I know it's hard to answer because you haven't guided on that yet or would you be imagining, David, that we might kind of just drag across that 15% into 2024 as a starting point. And if you can't answer it numerically, maybe you could just kind of speak to some of these time frames qualitatively. Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. I think we haven't provided guidance for next year. We cited that given the amount of our revenue growth that embedded in our existing customer base. The timing of the lapsing of optimization is critical to that. We said we see green shoots has been said, but it's too early to call that. So that's the biggest factor. In addition, we said that our new logo performance in terms of assigning new customers who then ramped is another green shoot that could do that, but it's -- we haven't provided guidance on specific numbers for next year, so I really can't go further.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, look, I mean, we are -- obviously, we're optimistic that we're still very early in a big tech transition. Short-term, we don't really control the growth of existing customers and how much to optimize their cloud environment and things like that. But for everything that we control and we secure on, which is new products, the quality of the products and the new customers and the attach of these new products with customers. Everything we see seems to be working and we see great results from that. And these are obviously great trends for the future. The one thing I would add is that in our conversation with our customers at a conference just last week. Most of the conversations were around who we're going to get our customers to implement new use cases, add up new products, scale up, consolidate onto our platform. There was still a little bit of customers thinking about cost control, optimization and things like that, but we also see less a bit of a time. So when that kicks in, in terms of the overall growth in aggregate, as David said, it's too early to tell and we want to be careful there because we know sometimes our customers will know everything themselves. They might face more difficulties as they go. But we're very optimistic about the mid, long term, obviously.\nMark Murphy: And Olivier, thank you for that. Just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned strong new logo bookings and I think we don't see that in the new customer count, but you rattled off a handful of seven and eight figure wins, which I believe each and every one of this sounded like a consolidation play onto other vendor -- off of other vendors and displacing those on to Datadog. Am I interpreting it accurately to think that maybe you're seeing a pretty big shift there, where maybe in terms of just win rates, competitive displacements kind of seeing this vision of the consolidated platform really putting a dent in the competitive landscape to Datadog's advantage?\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. Well, in general, we see it and we see -- by nature, this consolidation deals tend to be the ones that have the biggest headline number when we close them as opposed to just a continuation of their existing run rate we have with those customers. So that's what causes the step functions there, and that's why we call them out on the earnings call. But in general, we have a record number of new business deals across -- above $100,000. So what you don't see in the overall number of customers is the spread between smaller, medium and larger. There's quite a bit of noise at the low end of that customer count, which makes the number ebb and flow a little bit. But for the part that we target with our sales force, which are the middle and the high end of it, where we actually see those numbers go nicely and commensurately with all sales force. So we're very happy about that.\nDavid Obstler: Just to clarify the customer count. So on gross additions, a number -- very consistent with what we've seen in previous quarters. But as Olivier mentioned, more larger deals resulted in a higher average land. That's what produced the record Q2. And the net -- the weight on the net is, we mentioned the cleanup, but on the very low end customers that are on the border between very, very slight usage and free trial. So the gross addition activities were consistent and strong. And in fact, I think as you mentioned and as you get to the larger deals, you have more consolidation impetus within those wins.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs.\nAnisha Narayan: Hey. This is Anisha (ph) on for Kash. Two quick questions. One may be on usage growth slowdown. Is that coming from particular end markets or segments or verticals that you can highlight? And second, maybe on hiring, while you're seeing green shoots in new logo growth and we had a great number of announcements from the DASH conference, what would give you conviction to ramp up hiring or since you've moderated your go-to-market motion right now? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. On the -- so first on the growth slowdown. This is, I would say, across the board with the optimization, but it is a lot more pronounced with cloud-native businesses than with traditional enterprises. And the reasons for that are that cloud native businesses have a lot more they're spending on the cloud and a lot more of an emphasis on saving there than the larger enterprises that are a lot earlier in the cloud migration and that still have most of their system or a majority of their IT spend that is outside of cloud. So this is where we've seen the most optimization. It's still where we see the most optimization, though, as we said in the call, we saw that the earlier cohorts of cloud-native customers that started optimizing a year ago are showing some stabilization and some higher commitments with us in the past couple of months. In terms of hiring, I think we're still growing the company, and we're still investing. What we've done is we have moderate to that of growth to align on the -- on what we've seen in the market. But we still consider we are very, very early in terms of the -- or put our journey. We still have a lot to build in observability. We have a lot to build in security. We have a lot to build and develop our workforce and developer experience. We have a lot to be in ITSM. There's many, many new use cases we're going after, including AI. And so we're not going to stop hiring and we're not going to stop innovating there. The last thing I'll mention is that we've also been growing our go-to-market teams. And the reason for that is those investments in go-to-market are yielding incremental growth on the new logo and new product side. As we said in the call, that part of the business has been working very well, and we\u2019re very satisfied with the output there. So we\u2019ll keep growing the team while being mindful of the margins we need to protect.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Roberge from William Blair.\nJacob Roberge: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Obviously, AI is something that a lot of customers are excited about, but we're hearing that it may be delaying purchasing decisions in other parts of that tech stack until customers kind of figure out how they want to incorporate AI into their broader organization and just how much that will cost? Do you feel like that dynamic impacted Q2 at all with just maybe a near-term low in IT spending until broader AI plans are finalized? Or is the updated guide mainly just driven by the optimizations you've been calling out?\nOlivier Pomel: We don't really see that trends play. I would say -- the one thing I would say is or AI customer is fully into two accounts right now. They are the ones that have been working on it for the past two, three years, that our providers of AI themselves or business that are completely built on AI and we see those business reaching scale, in some cases, very large scale right now. And -- but it's a relatively small number of customers. There's a much larger number of customers that are standing to embrace AI. But those are still early, and it's probably going to take a number of quarters even yours in some cases for those use cases and those customers to reach full scale. So again, a much larger number of customers, but quite early. So we have those two trends at play when you look at our AI penetration and the AI adoption.\nJacob Roberge: Okay. Helpful. And then you called out the strong new logo bookings quite a few times there. Are there any commonalities between those customers from just a size or maybe an industry perspective? And I'm curious if you've started to see any of the newer generative AI-focused companies that are creating these LLMs start to actually layer into your model from a customer perspective?\nOlivier Pomel: Right. And is part of your question -- can you read it? You were \u2013 your volume was a little bit low.\nJacob Roberge: Yeah. The first part was just around the strong new logo bookings and just if there was any commonalities between those customers from a size or an industry perspective?\nOlivier Pomel: The new logo bookings are in terms of value like their [indiscernible] at mid-market and enterprise. So on the larger side and on the more traditional side. We have a number of companies or customers that are also the providers of AI, but some of those have been customers for some time already. And in some situations, we have new business units of existing customers that were with us for a while, but also started new business units around AI that start adapting more product. More recently, we have one of those also in the call comments from a very large customer.\nJacob Roberge: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: On sales and marketing in Q2, you've never been down sequentially. Are you holding back on quota-carrying rep hiring to get the reps productive? Are you going to be adding on that side? And a quick follow-up.\nDavid Obstler: The biggest factor there was the sales kickoff that would be in the first quarter and not in the second quarter. So the change has more to do with the timing of events. Be that as it may, as Olivier (ph) mentioned, we're continuing to invest in sales quota-capacity, but we are growing that at a lower rate than we did last year. But the major factor in the sequential was a seasonal thing around events.\nBrent Thill: Okay. And real quick, just some of the large customer adds in 80, your cadence was pushing 130 to 170. So is something competitively going on there or is it just you're equally seeing the SMB and Enterprise act the same way in terms of their conservatism?\nDavid Obstler: I didn't understand -- what -- I didn't understand the question.\nYuka Broderick: Brian, you're talking about the net adds of $100,000 plus customers?\nBrent Thill: Correct.\nDavid Obstler: It was 80 versus 130 to 170 in the last four quarters. Yes. I would say that we said that the number of customers has been relatively steady, although, it's decelled (ph). And we have gotten, I would say, in that range in land, the average land has been larger. So of those that are landing smaller. And when net retention goes down because the major source of customers going into that would be from customers below $100,000. And bigger factor would be that it takes longer for those customers to evolve into a 100,000, and that's the biggest factor in that.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. And just to reiterate what we're saying, we're very happy with the addition of customers on the medium and large size. These numbers are going up across the board in terms of new customers and new products and -- so we feel very good about that. And if nothing else, the things are improving there.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: Hey, guys. Two questions. First, can you finish on [Technical Difficulty] Can you just talk about how usage traded month by month, April, May, June? And if you can go there any logic around that? And then my second question is just, Olivier, you had said there was the difference between those [Technical Difficulty].\nOlivier Pomel: I didn't hear your second question. You're breaking up a little bit. So the first question -- and for the first question to start, maybe was on the ERT during the quarter, I guess. Yes. So ERT was not completely out of the ordinary for us. So I will say we see -- we had a low in May. I would say in late April and May, we started having a low. And then things improved in June and improved some more in July, which is after the end of the quarter. That being said, as we -- for more guidance for the rest of the year, we based that on what we saw throughout the quarter and we discount it. And we're trying to avoid looking too much at what we saw the partial quarters we go after that. That's been offset as you through that, and we'll stick to that today.\nMichael Turits: Thanks. And then the second question was the optimization that was particular to absorbability. Is there any difference across your major product categories, let's say, APM versus logs versus infrastructure?\nOlivier Pomel: So the ones that are the most sensitive to that are logs, some part of infrastructure, which is custom metrics and some part of APM, which is additional large volume transactions that customers might tradition to what they get included with every single cost to deploy APM on. And we've seen some optimization on that, that's been specific to observability. I would say it does go hand in hand with the overall co-optimization our customers are doing. So the timing might always be exactly the same, which is also why we're careful about the trends that we're forecasting based on the sort of the improvement we've seen recently.\nMichael Turits: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I want to start with a clarification. Did you actually lower your discount rate that you apply to your organic growth relative to your annual outlook or when you put that together this quarter?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, we would essentially discount the most recent assumption. So if the most recent assumptions were lower, we said they were lower in Q2 then we would be lowering that in the guidance assumptions going forward.\nAndrew Nowinski: Right. So it wasn't just the organic growth rate being lower, your actual discount rate was lower, too?\nDavid Obstler: I don't know -- sorry, I don't understand your question. We do our guidance based on taking the assumptions and then discounting. I don't know -- you'd have to clarify what you mean by the discount rate.\nOlivier Pomel: We don't have a discount rate card for guidance. But we do discount the historical, as we give guidance for the future.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Fair enough. And then I just had a question on that large deal, the eight-figure deal. Is that large enough that we should normalize it when we think about our estimates for next year pr do you have enough of those eight-figure deals in the pipeline that it will blend out?\nOlivier Pomel: I don't think you need to normalize for it.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi from Wedbush.\nTaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the new logo bookings that you mentioned. What is the average duration of new bookings or new logo bookings? And how has that trended so far?\nDavid Obstler: We haven't discussed the duration of new bookings versus existing bookings, our durations in terms of contract it tended to be just under a year, nine months to 10 months, but we haven't given information on the difference between new bookings, I would say the larger -- if you're getting to the because most of the revenues are existing customers, if it's -- if you're talking about renewals or new contracts on existing customers that would have the larger effect on contract duration. As we said, there was a trend towards longer-term deals, which extended the duration in terms of our existing customers.\nTaz Koujalgi: And just to clarify, the duration for new customers was consistent with the prior quarter or was it higher?\nOlivier Pomel: The duration increased. So we said that the RPO total was higher than the current RPO and that the reason was that duration had gone up slightly from previous periods. Duration increased in contracts.\nTaz Koujalgi: Yeah. Very helpful. Just one follow-up. That 40% of the new, I guess, revenue growth came from new customers. So 10 points of the revenue growth came from new customers who signed up in the last, I guess, year. Is that a consistent metric or was that higher or lower than what you usually see?\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah. We report that in our Qs. That's -- the 40% has is higher than it had been. That's mathematically true when net retention goes down with more consistency of new, you would have a higher percent. The 10 points, so the 10 points of growth or of our growth would be something that would be more consistent and not as dependent on the net retention.\nTaz Koujalgi: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda from Bank of America Securities.\nKoji Ikeda: Hey, Olivier and David. Just 1 from me here in the interest of time. Olivier, in your prepared remarks, you called out 2% of ARR being generated from next-gen AI customers. I wanted to dig into that a little bit more. How should we be thinking about how you define what a next-gen AI customer is that an existing customer with very specific AI initiatives or is that a next-gen AI-specific customers, say, like an LLM vendor? And then what was that contribution during 1Q? Thanks, guys.\nOlivier Pomel: So it's -- you can see it as the customers that are either selling AI themselves. So that would be LM vendors and the like. Our customers whose whole business is so is built on differentiated AI technology. And we've been fairly selective in terms of who we put in a category because companies everywhere are very eager to said that they differentiate we are today. So this is an illustration basically of the new kinds of businesses we've seen emerge, I would say, in the past year, 1.5 years, two years. In some cases, it might be divisions of existing larger companies, but in most situations, these are fairly recent and newer companies.\nDavid Obstler: We didn\u2019t give a comparable for the numbers. This is the first time we disclose this. And we probably won\u2019t disclose it on a regular basis just to give more color to what we see in the market today.\nKoji Ikeda: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you very much for taking the question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you. I'd love to hear what you thought about the attendance at Datadog Dash in San Francisco versus your expectations? And then more broadly about the -- or your thoughts around the return to in-person events like this?\nOlivier Pomel: So overall, we're actually very happily surprised. So we have decided to go to put Dash in San Francisco this year. So we switch things up a little bit and maybe see different customers than the ones we see when we do it on the East Coast. We're a little bit worried to be honest because we did it in the summer in San Francisco, and we had heard our stories about or get people into price to show up. And we've been very, very happily surprised. We got great attendance actually higher than we had modeled, which forced us to scramble the first day to add some shares in the keynote roads. And so overall, the time was very good. The conference was very productive. That was very, very good. In terms of the return to in-person events across the board, we see them happen whether that\u2019s our own conference or the other industry or an conferences that we exhibit at, we see a lot of success with those again. And since customers are very eager to connect and come to these events. So definitely something that\u2019s happening this year that was maybe not happening as much the years before.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Thanks, Olivier.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Thank you for taking the question. First for Olivier and then I had a follow-up. So given the slight improvement in usage trends that you cited in the first quarter, it was a bit surprising to hear that Q2 usage growth for existing customers was a little lower than prior quarters because we haven't really been hearing this from other consumption business models that have recently reported. And I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts as to why the usage growth for existing customers may have downtick this quarter? Anything come across?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, I think it's -- look, at the end of the day, we have a slightly different customer mix than some of the other folks. There are some optimizations that are with others that are special to cloud that maybe it's also specific to different clouds of which we have a different mix than the rest of the industry. So when you combine all of that, you might see some different timing effects in terms of how various optimization might heat us versus others. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I think the trends are broadly the same as what you see anywhere in the industry. And the other participants are also quite careful about not calling an IBM (ph) to all of the optimization. So are we, even though from the behavior we see from our -- who we think of other customers, who are the most at risk of optimization. We feel better about the path we see them tech and the usage trends we see of late.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thanks, Oli. And then I wanted to ask on the security side because you mentioned 79 customers now over $100,000, including a handful spending more than $1 million. So for those largest customers in particular, can you give us a flavor for which Datadog security products they're most frequently using? Also, how much of this, again, to those largest wins, how much of this is greenfield as opposed to displacement? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: The largest customers there tend to use almost all of our security products today. Sometimes there are some exceptions. And these are customers that tend to be on the tech forward mid-market higher-end of the market side that deployers world-to-world in their organizations. Typically, the customers that have us in a six- figures are above tend to be -- can be enterprise or mid-market, but the ones that are mid and above tend to be mid-market and more tech forward. And I would say overall, the adoption tracks the -- the adoption in the industry of a unified DevSecOps as a practice. And again to zoom out a little bit, we believe that this is where the whole industry is going. And we're building a product with completely ready and we have a fully mature end-to-end solution that is relevant to every single possible customer. So that by the time this becomes with general practicing in industry where we no-brainer choice for all of those customers and so-far we're pleased with what we're doing there.\nGregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Olivier Pomel, CEO of Datadog, for closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. So first of all, thank you all for attending the call today. I also want to thank all of our employees, all the Datadog's around the world for a Q2 that was very well-executed. And I want to thank all of our customers for making DASH last week such a vibrant conference and making some products here in terms of conversations we've had with them. And with these good words, thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our team continued to execute well in Q2 as we welcome thousands of attendees at our Dashes conference last week. We continue to deliver a large number of new product innovations and we recorded strong new logo bookings throughout the quarter. Let me start with a review of our Q2 financial performance. Revenue was $509 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high-end of our guidance range. We ended with about 26,100 customers, up from about 21,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 2,990 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,420 last year. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR, and we generated free cash flow of $142 million, with a free cash flow margin of 28%. Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. At a high level, first, we saw Q2 usage growth for existing customers that was a bit lower than it had been in previous quarters. Second, we do see signs that cloud optimization may start to subside. And third, we continue scaling our sales with strong new logo bookings in Q2. Going one-level deeper. In Q2, we saw usage growth for existing customers that was a bit lower than it had been in previous quarters. We continue to see customers, particularly some larger spending customers, scrutinize costs and optimize their cloud and observability usage during Q2. We are reflecting this lower growth in our updated guidance for 2023, and David will provide more commentary regarding our guidance geography. On the other hand, we are seeing signs that the cloud optimization across our customer base may start to subside. The cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago appear to have stabilized the users growth at the end of Q2, as indicated by the recent activity and the related commitments with us. And we saw usage growth in aggregates rebound in July to levels that are more similar to what we see in Q1. While it is too early to call an end to cloud optimization and a significant level of macro uncertainty remains, these new trends, along with the tenor of our customer interactions are encouraging. Lastly, our bookings were strong in Q2. Our new logo and new product bookings and deal cycles haven't been impacted by the period of cloud optimization and we continue to see healthy growth on the sales side. From a new logo bookings perspective, we had our largest Q2 and second largest quarter ever, only behind the seasonally larger Q4 2022. We also closed a record number of new business deals larger than $100,000 in annual commitment. And with our land extend model, we expect new logos to turn into much larger customers over time as they lead into the cloud, and add up more of our product. So as a conclusion, while we do apply conservatism to our guidance, recent usage trends as well as strong new logo activity and customer ramp-ups are positive signs for our future growth. Now turning to platform adoption. Q2 metrics show that our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 82% of customers were using two or more products, up from 79% a year ago. 45% of customers were using four or more products, up from 37% a year ago, and 21% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 14% a year ago. The strong multiproduct adoption include expansion into our new newest products. About 30% of our customers have already adopted at least one of our products launched since 2021, including CI visibility database monitoring, cloud security management, sensitive data scanner, cloud craft and others. We expect more opportunities to expand adoption of these products as we continue to broaden their capabilities over time. In Securities, we mentioned last quarter that over 5,000 customers have adopted security products. While many of these 5,000 are just getting started with Datadog Security, we are seeing opportunities to help customers secure their cloud at scale. As of Q2, 79 of our customers spent more than $100,000 on Datadog Security and a handful are now spending more than $1 million. Now let's move on to R&D. Last week, we had our DASH User Conference and introduced a number of exciting new products and features for our users. To kick off our keynote, we launched our first innovation for generative AI and large language model. We showcased our LLM observability product, enabling ML engineers to safely deploy and manage the models in production. This includes the model catalog centralized place to view and manage every model in every state of our customer development pipeline; analysis and insight on model performance, which allows all engineers to identify and address performance and quality issue with the model themselves; and help identify model drift, the performance degradation that happens over time as model interact with real-world data. We also introduced Bits AI. Bits understands natural language and provide insights from across the Datadog platform as well as from our customers' collaboration and documentation tools. Among its many features, Bits AI can act as an incident management copilot identifying and suggesting success, generating synthetic tests and triggering workflows to automatically remediate critical issue. And we announced 15 new integrations across the next-generation AI stack from GPU infrastructure providers to Vector databases, module vendors and AR orchestration frameworks. As we said last quarter, we are excited about these new AI technologies, and we believe Datadog is uniquely positioned to both help our customers make the best of them as well as to incorporate them into our product alongside our data and workloads. And although, it's early days for everyone in this space, we are getting traction with AI customers. And in Q2, our next-gen AI customers contributed about 2% of ARR. Moving on from AI. We showcased a number of new capabilities in the observability space. We introduced Flex logs for log management, allowing customers to flexibly choose retention periods and required performance separately to make new high-volume million use cases cost-effective. We are simplifying APM onboarding for large organizations, so engineers can enable APM across all applications without any core changes. With APM trade squaring, our customers can now understand the complete impact of any localized issue. We introduced our Error Tracking Assistant, which manages AI capabilities with live observability data to automatically explain, solve and test for production errors. In digital experience, we're also applying next-gen AI technologies to help customers automatically generate synthetic tests from their live traffic data. And we have expanded our mobile monitoring features bringing a first-class experience for mobile developer teams with mobile session replay and mobile application testing. We also announced several innovations in cloud security. Our new security inbox surfaces the most pressing security issues, correlating thousands of technical insights and reducing them to a smaller number of actionable tasks. We can now expect more infrastructure vulnerabilities, whether they are in applications, container images as our hosts. With custom code venerability detection, we extended our detection capabilities beyond auto [indiscernible] and into customers on code identifying the exact vulnerable code mixed feedback with the majority in detail. And with Cloud Sim investigator, our customers can visually map an attacker's behavior going back more than a year, leading to faster investigation and remediation. Shifting left, we're delivering more solutions to developers with static analysis. Customers can scan code for quality issues directly within Datadog and we are introducing quality gates for engineers can set rules and prevent e-secure, buggy or slow code from deploying production. Finally, we announced new capabilities to help customers spend on property to receive more efficiently. Our container resource utilization functionality makes it clear which applications are under or over provisioned. And with cloud cost recommendations, we're adding to our cloud cost management product to automatically discover saving opportunities and act on them. Those were just some of the many announcements we made at DASH. Our Investor Relations website includes a link to the DASH keynote, and I encourage you to watch it to learn more. Before I step away from more innovation, I'm also pleased to note that for the third year in a row, Datadog has been named the leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and Observability. We believe this validates our approach to deliver unified platform, which breaks on silos across teams and to focus intensely on product innovation. Now let's move on to sales and marketing. As I said earlier, we recorded strong new logo bookings, and we continue to see significant expansion opportunities with existing customers. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed an eight-figure deal over three years with a major American video games company. These customers' previous SaaS observability vendor was not delivering on critical capabilities such as quality alerting and collaborative incident management and a recent pricing change motivated to get some rich consider other vendors. By moving to Datadog, this customer expects to get higher value out of their monitoring, produce [indiscernible] and eliminate silos among users. And as we achieve better results, they expect to save over $1 million annually by shifting to Datadog from their previous vendor. Next, we signed a seven-figure land with a major broadcaster. This customer is moving to AWS and serverless and its fragmented legacy in open-source tools meet longer incident resolution times and confusion among teams. This customer is developing seven Datadog products, consolidating five tools and has already ramped Datadog to over 500 users. Next, we signed a seven-figure land with a leading Japanese toys and media company. This company has been using a competitive observability vendor alongside smaller tools and home-grown capabilities. With the adoption of five Datadog products, they have full visibility into their applications. They can save time on the busy work and focus on delivering great experiences for their customers. Next, we signed a seven-figure expansion with one of the world's largest tech companies. This customer is seeing massive adoption of its new generative AI product and needs to scale their GPU fleet to meet increasing demand for AI workload. Using their home-grown tools were slowing them down and put at risk critical product launches. With Datadog, this team is able to programmatically manage new environments as they come online, track and alert on their service level objectives and provide real-time visibility for [indiscernible]. Last but not least, we signed an expansion with one of the world's largest financial institutions, taking this customer to eight-figure ARR. This customer operates at massive scale, supporting thousands of applications run by tens of thousands of developers and we have a strategic initiative to move aggressively to the public cloud this year. They chose Datadog as their preferred observability platform for cloud application. And as their business units modernize, they are expanding to 10 Datadog products and replacing a number of legacy commercial tools and that is for this quarter's highlights. I'd like to thank our go-to-market team for their execution in Q2 and for helping our customers make the most out of Dash last week. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, let me speak to our longer-term outlook. Despite the recent trends of product optimization and continued macro uncertainty, our posture remains the same. We are confident in our long-term growth opportunities, driven by the secular trends of cloud migration and digital transformation as well as our rapid pace of innovation to set customers in observability and beyond. And we think our strong new logo and product adoption trends this quarter are indicative of the continued large and growing opportunity for Datadog. So our long-term plans have not changed. We are continuing to invest to serve our customers as they move to the cloud, AI and other modern technologies. With that, let me turn it over to our CFO. David? No, we don't see a big change in the nature of the optimization, it's a mix of a optimization of the cloud workloads themselves and little bit also on the observability side for the new (ph) products that have volume that can be separate from the cloud workloads, such as log from metrics and things like that. I would say, so this quarter we did see a little bit lower growth as we said in the comments across the board from existing customers. We suggest that the customers have started optimizing earlier, we're not done yet and some others have started later and they all across many are (ph) there. We did see, however, that some of the customers in the course of customers and but you're going to stay optimizing a year ago and that we're on the larger side and on the primary side has stabilized their growth. And we feel a lot more confident now that they've done at least as far as they know. As we've seen some of these customers start committing long-term forward again with us and at levels that are at or above their current levels of usage, which suggest that you have a good idea of what is going next, which is all inspired -- part of what you for your comments about the -- fact that we think we might we see some signs that the this period by end. Still too early to call it, but we see some -- we seem to be on more solid ground there. Sanjit, you're breaking up a little bit. So I hope I answered your question appropriately, but the -- we do see a slightly higher return at the very, very low end. This is more related to the health of what happens to tiny, tiny businesses that use us for small amounts and that themselves might disappear go out of business or start having needle together. We did have a onetime cleanup also this quarter as we -- on an ongoing basis, we don't create some customers if they are not super active in the platform or if they are deals are out -- are not paid up today. We changed some of the criteria around that, which ended up with a onetime cleanup of 200 customers, which changed a number there. But beyond that, we do see a little bit higher churn at the very, very low end. The numbers there are small in terms of revenue. They're actually completely material and the overall gross retention remains unchanged and in the mid to high 90s in aggregate. Yeah. And beyond that, I think it's a good point, David, we do see -- we're actually very happy with what we see on the new product and new logos out of the business. We're lending record numbers of new customers of scale and we're also seeing more and more consolidation on to us. If nothing else, the committee dynamics seems to turn more into our favor as time goes by there, independently from what we see in terms of churn or go to very end (ph). We can't really give you a percentage there. But the cohort we mentioned on the call was the one we were looking at for getting a sense of stabilization in the optimization was the cohort that started optimizing the first that was typically large in volume, very cloud-native in nature and that we consider to be the highest risk one. So the one that weighed on our growth numbers, the most over the past few quarters and that's the one we based on a lot of comment on. In addition to the other trends that David mentioned earlier, on the fact that in aggregate, we saw our growth of existing customers pick up first late in Q2 and then in July. Well, look, I mean, we are -- obviously, we're optimistic that we're still very early in a big tech transition. Short-term, we don't really control the growth of existing customers and how much to optimize their cloud environment and things like that. But for everything that we control and we secure on, which is new products, the quality of the products and the new customers and the attach of these new products with customers. Everything we see seems to be working and we see great results from that. And these are obviously great trends for the future. The one thing I would add is that in our conversation with our customers at a conference just last week. Most of the conversations were around who we're going to get our customers to implement new use cases, add up new products, scale up, consolidate onto our platform. There was still a little bit of customers thinking about cost control, optimization and things like that, but we also see less a bit of a time. So when that kicks in, in terms of the overall growth in aggregate, as David said, it's too early to tell and we want to be careful there because we know sometimes our customers will know everything themselves. They might face more difficulties as they go. But we're very optimistic about the mid, long term, obviously. Yeah. Well, in general, we see it and we see -- by nature, this consolidation deals tend to be the ones that have the biggest headline number when we close them as opposed to just a continuation of their existing run rate we have with those customers. So that's what causes the step functions there, and that's why we call them out on the earnings call. But in general, we have a record number of new business deals across -- above $100,000. So what you don't see in the overall number of customers is the spread between smaller, medium and larger. There's quite a bit of noise at the low end of that customer count, which makes the number ebb and flow a little bit. But for the part that we target with our sales force, which are the middle and the high end of it, where we actually see those numbers go nicely and commensurately with all sales force. So we're very happy about that. Yeah. On the -- so first on the growth slowdown. This is, I would say, across the board with the optimization, but it is a lot more pronounced with cloud-native businesses than with traditional enterprises. And the reasons for that are that cloud native businesses have a lot more they're spending on the cloud and a lot more of an emphasis on saving there than the larger enterprises that are a lot earlier in the cloud migration and that still have most of their system or a majority of their IT spend that is outside of cloud. So this is where we've seen the most optimization. It's still where we see the most optimization, though, as we said in the call, we saw that the earlier cohorts of cloud-native customers that started optimizing a year ago are showing some stabilization and some higher commitments with us in the past couple of months. In terms of hiring, I think we're still growing the company, and we're still investing. What we've done is we have moderate to that of growth to align on the -- on what we've seen in the market. But we still consider we are very, very early in terms of the -- or put our journey. We still have a lot to build in observability. We have a lot to build in security. We have a lot to build and develop our workforce and developer experience. We have a lot to be in ITSM. There's many, many new use cases we're going after, including AI. And so we're not going to stop hiring and we're not going to stop innovating there. The last thing I'll mention is that we've also been growing our go-to-market teams. And the reason for that is those investments in go-to-market are yielding incremental growth on the new logo and new product side. As we said in the call, that part of the business has been working very well, and we're very satisfied with the output there. So we'll keep growing the team while being mindful of the margins we need to protect. We don't really see that trends play. I would say -- the one thing I would say is or AI customer is fully into two accounts right now. They are the ones that have been working on it for the past two, three years, that our providers of AI themselves or business that are completely built on AI and we see those business reaching scale, in some cases, very large scale right now. And -- but it's a relatively small number of customers. There's a much larger number of customers that are standing to embrace AI. But those are still early, and it's probably going to take a number of quarters even yours in some cases for those use cases and those customers to reach full scale. So again, a much larger number of customers, but quite early. So we have those two trends at play when you look at our AI penetration and the AI adoption. Right. And is part of your question -- can you read it? You were \u2013 your volume was a little bit low. The new logo bookings are in terms of value like their [indiscernible] at mid-market and enterprise. So on the larger side and on the more traditional side. We have a number of companies or customers that are also the providers of AI, but some of those have been customers for some time already. And in some situations, we have new business units of existing customers that were with us for a while, but also started new business units around AI that start adapting more product. More recently, we have one of those also in the call comments from a very large customer. Yes. And just to reiterate what we're saying, we're very happy with the addition of customers on the medium and large size. These numbers are going up across the board in terms of new customers and new products and -- so we feel very good about that. And if nothing else, the things are improving there. I didn't hear your second question. You're breaking up a little bit. So the first question -- and for the first question to start, maybe was on the ERT during the quarter, I guess. Yes. So ERT was not completely out of the ordinary for us. So I will say we see -- we had a low in May. I would say in late April and May, we started having a low. And then things improved in June and improved some more in July, which is after the end of the quarter. That being said, as we -- for more guidance for the rest of the year, we based that on what we saw throughout the quarter and we discount it. And we're trying to avoid looking too much at what we saw the partial quarters we go after that. That's been offset as you through that, and we'll stick to that today. So the ones that are the most sensitive to that are logs, some part of infrastructure, which is custom metrics and some part of APM, which is additional large volume transactions that customers might tradition to what they get included with every single cost to deploy APM on. And we've seen some optimization on that, that's been specific to observability. I would say it does go hand in hand with the overall co-optimization our customers are doing. So the timing might always be exactly the same, which is also why we're careful about the trends that we're forecasting based on the sort of the improvement we've seen recently. We don't have a discount rate card for guidance. But we do discount the historical, as we give guidance for the future. I don't think you need to normalize for it. The duration increased. So we said that the RPO total was higher than the current RPO and that the reason was that duration had gone up slightly from previous periods. Duration increased in contracts. Yeah. We report that in our Qs. That's -- the 40% has is higher than it had been. That's mathematically true when net retention goes down with more consistency of new, you would have a higher percent. The 10 points, so the 10 points of growth or of our growth would be something that would be more consistent and not as dependent on the net retention. So it's -- you can see it as the customers that are either selling AI themselves. So that would be LM vendors and the like. Our customers whose whole business is so is built on differentiated AI technology. And we've been fairly selective in terms of who we put in a category because companies everywhere are very eager to said that they differentiate we are today. So this is an illustration basically of the new kinds of businesses we've seen emerge, I would say, in the past year, 1.5 years, two years. In some cases, it might be divisions of existing larger companies, but in most situations, these are fairly recent and newer companies. So overall, we're actually very happily surprised. So we have decided to go to put Dash in San Francisco this year. So we switch things up a little bit and maybe see different customers than the ones we see when we do it on the East Coast. We're a little bit worried to be honest because we did it in the summer in San Francisco, and we had heard our stories about or get people into price to show up. And we've been very, very happily surprised. We got great attendance actually higher than we had modeled, which forced us to scramble the first day to add some shares in the keynote roads. And so overall, the time was very good. The conference was very productive. That was very, very good. In terms of the return to in-person events across the board, we see them happen whether that's our own conference or the other industry or an conferences that we exhibit at, we see a lot of success with those again. And since customers are very eager to connect and come to these events. So definitely something that's happening this year that was maybe not happening as much the years before. Well, I think it's -- look, at the end of the day, we have a slightly different customer mix than some of the other folks. There are some optimizations that are with others that are special to cloud that maybe it's also specific to different clouds of which we have a different mix than the rest of the industry. So when you combine all of that, you might see some different timing effects in terms of how various optimization might heat us versus others. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I think the trends are broadly the same as what you see anywhere in the industry. And the other participants are also quite careful about not calling an IBM (ph) to all of the optimization. So are we, even though from the behavior we see from our -- who we think of other customers, who are the most at risk of optimization. We feel better about the path we see them tech and the usage trends we see of late. The largest customers there tend to use almost all of our security products today. Sometimes there are some exceptions. And these are customers that tend to be on the tech forward mid-market higher-end of the market side that deployers world-to-world in their organizations. Typically, the customers that have us in a six- figures are above tend to be -- can be enterprise or mid-market, but the ones that are mid and above tend to be mid-market and more tech forward. And I would say overall, the adoption tracks the -- the adoption in the industry of a unified DevSecOps as a practice. And again to zoom out a little bit, we believe that this is where the whole industry is going. And we're building a product with completely ready and we have a fully mature end-to-end solution that is relevant to every single possible customer. So that by the time this becomes with general practicing in industry where we no-brainer choice for all of those customers and so-far we're pleased with what we're doing there. Thank you. So first of all, thank you all for attending the call today. I also want to thank all of our employees, all the Datadog's around the world for a Q2 that was very well-executed. And I want to thank all of our customers for making DASH last week such a vibrant conference and making some products here in terms of conversations we've had with them. And with these good words, thank you all."

            "name": "David Obstler",
            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. Q2 revenues was $509 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. In Q2, we continued to execute solidly and we also continue to see pressure on the usage growth of existing customers. To dive into some of the drivers of Q2 performance. First, as to usage growth of existing customers, we saw positive usage growth this quarter to lower than in recent quarters, with broadly similar trends across our product lines. While too early to draw broad conclusions, existing customer usage growth improved in July and was more similar to Q1 than that of Q2. We saw more pressure on cloud native businesses than traditional enterprise customers, similar to previous quarters. Regarding customers by spending size, the more moderate growth trends were consistent across the customer base with relatively more pressure on usage growth rates with larger customers. As Olivier discussed, the cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago, appear to have stabilized their usage growth with Datadog, though, we recognize that the growth rates of these optimizing customers may remain muted and other customers could optimize. Regarding total customers. Our customer count increased to 26,100 from 25,500 last quarter. This quarter's total paying customer count includes a one-time cleanup of about 200 financially immaterial customers at the very low end, who are moved to our free tier. Our gross customer additions have remained strong, especially with larger customers. Meanwhile, we are seeing some churn of smaller customers who have limited impact on our revenues. As a result, our gross revenue retention rate remains unchanged in the mid to high 90s, indicating the stickiness of our product and the importance of our product to our customers' operations. We are executing on strong new logo bookings and new customers contributing meaningfully to our growth as they ramp up. As Olivier mentioned, we had our second largest new logo bookings quarter and a record for Q2. We expect these customers to become more meaningful as they expand with us. In Q2, about 40% of our year-over-year revenue growth or 10 points of growth was attributable to growth from these new customers that were acquired in the past year. Finally, we continue to see consolidation opportunities, particularly in larger deals. Consolidation allows our customers to improve functionality by getting all of their data into one platform, while saving money at the same time. Moving on to our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate, or NRR. NRR was over 120% in Q2 as customers increased their usage and adopted more products. As we expected and as we discussed on last quarter's call, our trailing 12-month NRR decline but was above 120 in Q2 as existing customers continue to scrutinize their tech stack costs and make efficiency improvements. If our growth trajectory continues at current levels, we expect our trailing 12-month NRR to decline to below 120 in Q3. Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $520 million in the quarter, up 31% year-over-year. Billings duration increased slightly year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO was $1.25 billion, up 42% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was about up 30% year-over-year. We signed some larger multiyear deals in the quarter, which drove an increase in the duration year-over-year. As we've mentioned before, we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $414 million, representing a gross margin of 81.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.5% last quarter and 80.8% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. As a result, we are experiencing a gross margin, which is in excess of our target in the high 70s. Our Q2 OpEx grew 26% year-over-year, and this was a decline from 45% year-over-year growth last quarter. We moderated our hiring pace and executed on controlling costs, given the macro uncertainties. Q2 operating income was $106 million, or a 21% operating margin, up from 18% last quarter and flat to 21% in the year ago quarter. We are pleased with our execution on cost control and disciplined investment in this quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash from operations was $153 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $142 million for a free cash flow margin of 28%. Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the usage growth of our existing customers. As a reminder, our guidance philosophy is to carry forward trends observed in recent quarters, discounted with additional conservative. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $521 million to $525 million, which represents a 19% to 20% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $98 million to $102 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.35 per share based on approximately 354 weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion, which represents 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $390 million to $400 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.30 to $0.34 per share and based on approximately 351 million average sales diluted shares outstanding. Now finally, for some additional notes on the guidance. We have continued to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large long-term opportunities, and we are executing well on our plans to invest efficiently. Next, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $85 million and we expect our tax expense for the full year to be $14 million to $16 million. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be about 4% of revenues in fiscal year 2023. To reiterate Olivier's comments, we remain excited about our long-term growth opportunities and we're continuing to execute against those opportunities. I want to thank our Datadog worldwide for our efforts in this quarter. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yeah, it's both. Because our growth was a little lower than in Q2 than it had been in the previous quarters. We have that effect moving forward given our recurring revenue model. And then on top of that, we -- in our guidance philosophy, we discount the most recent performance, particularly around usage growth, but also in new logos. So it's a combination of both of that, those flowing through in our financial results for the year. We said that -- I think on the other side of it, we said that in dollars, we had a strong new logo bookings and also cross-sell. And a lot of that, as I said in my comments, or a portion of that tends to be consolidation onto the platform, which has been going on a long time. Yeah. I think we haven't provided guidance for next year. We cited that given the amount of our revenue growth that embedded in our existing customer base. The timing of the lapsing of optimization is critical to that. We said we see green shoots has been said, but it's too early to call that. So that's the biggest factor. In addition, we said that our new logo performance in terms of assigning new customers who then ramped is another green shoot that could do that, but it's -- we haven't provided guidance on specific numbers for next year, so I really can't go further. Just to clarify the customer count. So on gross additions, a number -- very consistent with what we've seen in previous quarters. But as Olivier mentioned, more larger deals resulted in a higher average land. That's what produced the record Q2. And the net -- the weight on the net is, we mentioned the cleanup, but on the very low end customers that are on the border between very, very slight usage and free trial. So the gross addition activities were consistent and strong. And in fact, I think as you mentioned and as you get to the larger deals, you have more consolidation impetus within those wins. The biggest factor there was the sales kickoff that would be in the first quarter and not in the second quarter. So the change has more to do with the timing of events. Be that as it may, as Olivier (ph) mentioned, we're continuing to invest in sales quota-capacity, but we are growing that at a lower rate than we did last year. But the major factor in the sequential was a seasonal thing around events. I didn't understand -- what -- I didn't understand the question. It was 80 versus 130 to 170 in the last four quarters. Yes. I would say that we said that the number of customers has been relatively steady, although, it's decelled (ph). And we have gotten, I would say, in that range in land, the average land has been larger. So of those that are landing smaller. And when net retention goes down because the major source of customers going into that would be from customers below $100,000. And bigger factor would be that it takes longer for those customers to evolve into a 100,000, and that's the biggest factor in that. Yes, we would essentially discount the most recent assumption. So if the most recent assumptions were lower, we said they were lower in Q2 then we would be lowering that in the guidance assumptions going forward. I don't know -- sorry, I don't understand your question. We do our guidance based on taking the assumptions and then discounting. I don't know -- you'd have to clarify what you mean by the discount rate. We haven't discussed the duration of new bookings versus existing bookings, our durations in terms of contract it tended to be just under a year, nine months to 10 months, but we haven't given information on the difference between new bookings, I would say the larger -- if you're getting to the because most of the revenues are existing customers, if it's -- if you're talking about renewals or new contracts on existing customers that would have the larger effect on contract duration. As we said, there was a trend towards longer-term deals, which extended the duration in terms of our existing customers. We didn't give a comparable for the numbers. This is the first time we disclose this. And we probably won't disclose it on a regular basis just to give more color to what we see in the market today."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution in Q1 as we continued broadening our platform, delivering new use cases for our existing users as well as signing up more customers, all on the backdrop of continued macro uncertainty and optimization of cloud workloads. Let me start with a review of our Q1 financial performance. In Q1, revenue was $482 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Note that this number factors in the impact of a service outage we experienced in March and which reduced our revenue for the quarter by about $5 million. We ended with about 25,500 customers, up from about 19,800 last year. Also note that we are now including customers who joined following our acquisition of Cloudcraft, representing about 1,400 net new customers to Datadog this quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,910 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,250 last year. The customers generated about 85% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $116 million, with a free cash flow margin of 24%. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 81% of customers were using 2 or more products, in line with last year. 43% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 35% a year ago. And 19% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 12% last year. Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we experienced business conditions that were similar to the previous several quarters. In Q1, user's growth from existing customers came in roughly as expected. We saw existing customer users growth in Q1 improved from the levels we saw in Q4, but remain a bit lower than the levels we experienced in Q2 and Q3. And as in recent quarters, we continue to see customers optimize their cloud spend, particularly those further along in their cloud migration and hosting a larger portion of their infrastructure in the cloud. Additionally, our new logo acquisition and bookings in Q1 were solid for what is a seasonally slower quarter. New local bookings reached a new record for Q1 and were up slightly from last year as we continued to add many promising new logos, which I'll discuss in a bit. With our land and expand model, we expect many of these new logos will turn into much larger customers as they add up more of our products over time. Despite a more cost-conscious demand environment, we have continued to land new customers and expand existing ones, and we are very proud to achieve several key milestones in Q1. So first, our total ARR exceeded $2 billion for the first time, a true achievement for all of us at Datadog even though we all know we're only getting started. Second, our APM suite and log management products together exceeded $1 billion in ARR. This demonstrates the expansion of our business well beyond our [indiscernible] monitoring product and our successful execution on the broad of the mobility platform. Remember that our APM suite includes 4 Datadog products: core APM, Synthetics, Real User monitoring and Continuous profile. Third, we continue to make steady progress with our cloud security products with continued growth in ARR and in customers. And I'm very pleased to announce that we now have more than 5,000 customers using our cloud security products. Now let's move on to R&D. We introduced a number of new security capabilities last month. We announced the general availability of Application Vulnerability Management, which provides visibility into the attack surface of production environment by automatically surfacing vulnerabilities. And instead of submerging users with thousands upon thousands of vulnerabilities, this new functionality is observability data to prioritize risks based on the estimated impact to the business and closes the loop between security, operations and development teams. We also introduced a number of new capabilities to our Cloud Security Management product. Workload security profiles allow customers to flag anomalous activity and improve overall accuracy of threat detection directly within the workload. And we now offer vulnerability detection for containers, automatically scanning live container images for known vulnerabilities. Now moving on from security to observability, we also announced the general availability of Data Streams Monitoring. These products specifically targets queuing, streaming and even driven pipelines, such as Kafka or RabbitMQ. These systems often span many different teams and technologies and are notoriously difficult to manage and troubleshoot. And for this, even standard APM and log management solutions are not specialized enough. Data Streams Monitoring automatically identifies the topology, interdependencies and key metrics of complex streaming data pipelines, allowing customers to maintain availability, correctness and latency for what is now a critical part of their business. Lastly, we were thrilled to unveil our newest data center in Japan last month. We see a large opportunity to serve our customers in the Asia Pacific region, which have seen significant growth over time and now represents high single digits as a percent of revenue. I also want to take a moment and share our excitement for the latest wave of AI innovation. And I'm going to use AI in this community here to refer to the recent advances in deep learning, large language models and generative AI. First, from a market perspective, over the long term, we believe AI will significantly expand our opportunity in observability and beyond. We seek massive improvements in developer productivity will allow individuals to write more applications and to do so faster than ever before. And as with past productivity increases, we think this will further shift value from writing code to observing, managing, fixing and securing live applications. In the short to medium term, we believe the rise of AI will increase the demand for compute and storage to train and run models, but it will also increase the value of proprietary data and further drive digital transformation and cloud migration as these  are all prerequisites for adoption. We also do expect quite a bit of noise in the market as the technology stack is progressing and changing very quickly. Now from a product perspective, we believe that we at Datadog are uniquely positioned to deliver value to our customers in this new world. First, we built Datadog from day 1 as a pure SaaS business precisely to be able to put our data to work at full scale and to train models to solve our customers' problems. Second, our large assets of contact with our customers gives us the insertion points to make AI relevant. This is where we see the value of having a variable customer base and being designed to be used every day by every single engineer. And third, we serve today some of the largest builders and consumers of AI services and are quickly adapting to their needs in a rapidly changing field. So in other words, we are really excited about the potential of AI for us and for the observability and security market, and I'm sure we'll discuss this topic further in the future. Okay. Let's move on to sales and marketing. As I said earlier, our go-to-market teams had another productive quarter. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed an expansion into 8 figures ARR with a leading AI company. This customer saw an order of magnitude increase in user demand and a third in new customers following enormous innovation and interest in generative AI. As a result, this customer now uses 6 Datadog products and relies on our platform to track and correlate key business metrics, ranging from uptime data to newer subscriptions and revenue. Next, we signed a high 7 figures expansion to another 8-figure ARR deal with one of the world's largest fintech companies. This customer has expanded meaningfully over time, and today see Datadog platform used by thousands of users across dozens of business units. With this expansion, this customer now uses 14 Datadog products and is consolidating multiple open source, homegrown and commercial tools across observability and security into the Datadog platform. Next, we signed a 7-figure expansion with a Fortune 500 health care company. Before using Datadog, major incidents would mobilize up to 150 employees for an average of 3 to 4 hours. With Datadog, they only need 20 employees for about 30 minutes with an opportunity to further reduce these numbers. I will note that we're also replacing a commercial observability competitor whose new pricing model was causing an increase in cost with lower value. This customer now expects to save more than $0.5 million every year by moving that to Datadog across several business units. Next, we signed a 6-figure land with a multinational clothing company. This company was previously heavily siloed, with each team using different monitoring tools. And as is often the case, this caused issues impacting revenue and customer experience. This customer is starting with 5 Datadog products and expect to consolidate and replace a total of 13 commercial and open-source tools with Datadog. And last but not least, we signed a 7-figure multiyear land with a leading university in Australia. This customer has historically relied on open source solutions. They evaluated a few commercial competitors, and Datadog won as their requirements involve both cloud and on-premise across logs, user experience and network device monitoring. This customer plans over time to migrate from more than 10 tools to the Datadog platform. And that's it for this quarter's highlights. I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams again for their continued execution in Q1. Now switching gears. Let me speak to our longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change to the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We do continue to see customers optimizing their cloud usage, and visibility remains limited as to when this optimization cycle will end, but we firmly believe it will. As before, we remain confident that we will continue to deliver value to more customers in their digital transformation and cloud migration journeys. And it is increasingly clear with each wave of technical innovation that every company in every industry and every geographic region has to take advantage of the cloud, microservices, container and generative AI and more. By relentlessly broadening the Datadog platform, we will continue to help our customers save on costs, execute with better engineering efficiency, drive competitive differentiation and deliver value to their own customers. So our long-term plans have not changed. We are continuing to invest to capture our long-term opportunities. And as David will discuss in a moment, the strength of our business model allows us to balance that with delivering financial performance. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. In Q1, we continued to execute well and deliver value to our customers. Revenue was $482 million, up 33% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-to-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q1 performance. First, we had an unusual outage in March, and we estimate that the impact to our revenues from that outage to be about $5 million. As we mentioned last quarter, we saw subdued usage growth in the month of December which created a lower growth trajectory to start the first quarter and drove seasonally weaker sequential growth in the first quarter. During Q1, we experienced a linearity pattern that is typical for us, which included usage growth in March that was higher than that in January and February. Overall, we saw existing customer usage growth in Q1 improved from the levels we saw in Q4, though it was slightly lower than the levels we experienced in Q2 and Q3 last year. Next, we continue to see larger spending customers grow smaller -- grow slower than smaller-spending customers. From an industry perspective, we continue to see the slowest growth in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food delivery. Geographically, we saw faster year-over-year growth in international than in North America. Our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate, or NRR, continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted more products. Based on our current growth trajectory, however, we expect our trailing 12-month NRR to be below 130% in Q2. While our net retention rate is expected to go below 130%, we continue to execute strongly on our platform innovation and our land and expand business model, as evidenced by our latest product announcements, our expanding cross-sell products and the examples of the strong Q1 renewals that Olivier discussed. Our dollar-based gross retention rate remained stable in the mid- to high 90s, an indication of the mission-critical nature of the Datadog platform for our customers. Now moving on to our financial results. Billings were $511 million, up 15% year-over-year. We had a large upfront bill for a client in Q1 '22 that did not recur at the same level or timing in Q1 '23. Pro forma for this client, billings growth was in the low 30s percent year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO, was $1.14 billion, up 33% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the high 20s percent year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $388 million, representing a gross margin of 80.5%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.6% last quarter and 80.4% in the year ago quarter. We continued to experience efficiencies in cloud costs, reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the mid- to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s percent range. Our Q1 non-GAAP OpEx grew 45% year-over-year. This is a decline from 54% year-over-year growth in the previous quarter. We continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market, but at a more moderate pace than last year. Q1 operating income was $86 million or an 18% operating margin, flat sequentially to Q4 2022 margin also of 18%. In the year ago quarter, operating margins was 23%, and it benefited from lack of in-person office, travel and event costs due to our COVID policies during the pandemic. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $134 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $116 million for a free cash flow margin of 24%. Now for our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continued to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers compared to historical periods. And as usual, we are basing our near-term guidance on recent activity we see with our customers. While existing customers are still expanding with us, we continue to assume in our guidance that cloud optimization is affecting their expansion rate for the rest of 2023. For the second quarter, as a result, we expect revenue to be in the range of $498 million to $502 million, which represents 23% to 24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $82 million to $86 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.27 to $0.29 per share range based on approximately 349 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.10 billion, which represents 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.20 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Some additional notes in our guidance. First, we have continued to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large, long-term opportunities, and we are executing well on our plans to invest efficiently. We expect the continued moderation of headcount growth, and the lapping of the COVID-affected historical expenses to result in continued slowing of OpEx growth during the remainder of 2023. We now plan to grow our non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding COGS, in fiscal year 2023 by approximately 30% year-over-year with an exit rate in Q4 in the low 20s percent year-over-year. We continue to expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $75 million. And we expect our tax expense in fiscal year 2023 to be in the range of $14 million to $16 million. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the range of 4% to 5% of revenues in fiscal year 2023. Now finally, to reiterate Olivier's comments, we remain excited about our long-term opportunities as our customers embark and expand on their cloud migration and digital transformation plans. We are continuing to invest to further expand the ways we reach our customers and help them along these journeys. I want to thank our Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in this quarter. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Could I speak -- could you speak to the optimization, Olivier, a little bit more in detail? Obviously, it's a journey for customers and there is like the initial steps. And then there's a follow-on. So if you think about the customer behavior in terms of what they do on optimization, is that still -- are you still seeing the same steps that are getting taken? Or are we going to kind of round 2, round 3, et cetera? So I'm just trying to understand a little bit where we are on that optimization journey if you have more color. And then I have one follow-up, please.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. I mean, the short of it is we don't know exactly yet. So we -- and I'm going to give an answer that's going to be very similar to the answer I gave last quarter, but we see customers taking another bite at their own workforce, like we saw it in a number of companies this morning actually even. So I don't think customers themselves know where they are done. So we're very prudent in terms of assuming an end to it in the near future. So when we look at our data, when we look at the -- what we hear from the hyperscalers also, we also listen carefully to their commentary on what they foresee in the near future. We don't see anything that gives us confidence that we can call an end to optimization next quarter or the quarter after that. So as far as our guidance goes and our plans for the year, we assume that this is going to continue at a similar level for the rest of the year. Now obviously, when we look at our customer base, we see some customers that obviously seem to be done with it and others that haven't done anything. So we try to keep an eye on that and model it, but we're not including any of that in our guidance.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then, David, on the cost side, so thanks for giving us the OpEx rate for the year and the exit rate. If you think about the -- there's always that situation of investing for the future and at some point, you did come out versus like surviving or like living in the current environment. How do you think about that investment philosophy of balancing like today versus getting ready for tomorrow?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, I would say that we've made substantial and consistent investments both in our go-to-market and our R&D over the last few years. And this year, we're balancing -- continuing to do that with 2 things, with prioritization as well as injecting some optimization or efficiency into the investments we had made. We're seeing the opportunity to get returns from the previous investments and to think through a little more the prioritization of those.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: I had a question, Olivier, on AI. It seems like we're on the cusp of another sort of compute cycle driven by AI. The last compute cycle, you guys were all over in terms of being ahead of the curve, in terms of the shift from monolith to micro services. And so with this new sort of compute cycle that we're about to embark on, what do you see -- how are sort of applications and the sort of the application stack, how is that going to change? And what are the implications for Datadog as a monitoring vendor? What are potentially the puts and takes with this in terms of how applications can be built going forward?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So first, I'd say it's a -- [indiscernible], it's fascinating time to be alive, to see all these, rapid innovation in the world of AI. The first thing I'd say is that it's still fairly early in terms of what the market going to look like in the AI world. Right now, there's one particular thing that's been -- that used to be very hard, which was building conventional models and chat bots and things like that, which almost overnight became almost a commodity basically. Anybody can incorporate it in any application. It's an API call away, and there is even a number of different options, commercial open source you can use today. So that just happened. That one has massive traction. You see it everywhere. But it also is opening the gate to many, many more, I would say, more customized, deeper applications on AI that may be built by a few vendors or may be built by a large number of companies instead, it's not quite clear yet. What we see on our end is that it's going to drive more compute, it's going to drive more value in the data that is being gathered by companies. It's going to drive digital transformation. It's going to drive cloud migration because, again, you can't actually adopt AI unless you have the data. You can't actually adopt it without having a modern architecture and an application you can scale up and down and infrastructure you can quickly provision and de-provision. You need to capture all of your -- to capture your data, you need to be digitally transformed. So you have data of all your customer interactions and everything that is proper to your business. So in the mid-term, we see that as a very clear accelerant to our business. Maybe with a little bit of noise, as I mentioned on the script earlier, in terms of what technologies end up being the winning ones and what technologies end up being sizzling after a few years, because it's still -- it's so early and there's so much innovation that out of 200 new things, there's probably only 10 or 20 that will matter to you somehow, but it's hard to know which ones are today. So short answer is, mid-term, a lot more of the current workloads, the types of workloads we see maybe with different sets of technologies. Longer term, I think we can all glimpse at the future where productivity for everyone, including software engineers, increases dramatically. And the way we see that as a business is, our job is to help our customers absorb the complexity of the applications they've built so they can understand and modify them, run them, secure them. And we think that the more productivity there is, the more people can write in the amount of time. The less they understand the software they produce and the more they need us, the more value it sends our way. So that's what makes us very confident in the long term here.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the thoughts, Olivier. As a follow-up and getting back to sort of the topic of cloud optimization. What have you -- what did you sort of see in April versus March and typically, maybe sort of baseline what April typically looks like for the company? And are there any customers that began optimization that maybe didn't start in 2022? Are you seeing incremental new customer cohorts get onboard the cloud optimization train?\nOlivier Pomel: So I would say April is broadly consistent with what we've seen in Q4 and Q1. I think it's -- there's no major difference to call out there. And it's too early also for us to call the quarter, obviously. So there's nothing very sharp to point out about April. On the customer optimization, Look, we have a large number of customers that are early in their cloud migration, early in the Datadog adoption and that are growing very fast. We haven't seen any optimization from those customers. It's possible we see optimization from some of those, which is why we remain very careful in our in our guidance. We don't assume basically that the optimization will stop at the customers that already have done it, and that the rest of the customer base is going to be fine after that.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: David, looking at the math on this large upfront bill that did not recur, it seems to be about $65 million, if I'm running that correctly. Can you possibly shed a little more light? For instance, will you recapture that or some of that in Q2? And what type of customer and customer dynamic is operating at that level? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nDavid Obstler: Yes. We -- that is a customer of ours. What we said was the billing frequency changed and the size. So that customer's bill will, one, be spread out more over time. That company -- that was a crypto company and continues to be a customer of ours, but that was an early optimizer. We had always talked that some of the industries that were most affected optimized. And that is -- so we will get that -- we will get that bill at a smaller size than was billed last year in a more of a chunked up billing way.\nOlivier Pomel: And look, this is one of the situations where this customer was in an industry that -- vertical that got pretty much decimated over the past year. And their own business was cut in 3 or 4 in terms of their revenue. And when that's the case, that we really work with customers to restructure their contract with us. We want to be part of the solution for them, not part of the problem. And that's what we did here, we restructured that contract. So we kept them as a happy customer for many more years and do deal that works for everyone with their business profile.\nDavid Obstler: In our company - since we've been public, we've pointed out when we have an unusual bill. So we don't have multiple of these types of situations. And what we've done, if you look back to our commentary, is when we've had one of those, a change of timing or a change of the duration of a bill or a size of a bill. We've tried to pro forma it in order to give everyone a sense of what the rest of the business is doing.\nMark Murphy: That's much appreciated on our part. And as a follow-up, Olivier, congrats on passing $2 billion in ARR, one of the fastest software companies ever to do that, pretty amazing. I did want to ask you as well on the optimizations. At the moment, Microsoft seems more optimistic that the optimization activity would start to normalize in the next couple or few quarters than Amazon does. And when we tear it apart, Azure has less exposure to tech companies which are doing layoffs. They have more exposure to generative AI, which is booming relative to AWS. So I'm wondering if that part lines up with your telemetry and your forecasting that perhaps your Azure monitoring business is going to start to turn the corner sooner, and then perhaps AWS would follow after that.\nOlivier Pomel: It's too early to tell. And by the way, it's a bit hard to just project our numbers from the -- this is just a reminder, it's hard to project our numbers from the numbers of the cloud providers because it's not a one-to-one in terms of what they report and what concerns the infrastructure and the applications directly. Different cloud providers have different things in there. And also, these vendors have -- in addition to the volumes that drive consumption on our end, they also have their own pricing dynamics. And typically, in those situations, the vendors with the largest bills are the ones that get pushed the most. So in this case, that would be AWS. But in terms of what we see in our data, there's no -- nothing to suggest that any particular cloud is recovering from optimization just yet. We also tried to read the hyperscaler comments. And depending on what you've read before and after, they look more or less positive, so I'm not quite sure I would project as much enthusiasm in the Microsoft comment. But what we know is that, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter for us. We're equally well positioned to capture workloads on Azure as we are on AWS and GCP. And the only part I would say of the Microsoft stack that we don't cover as well is everything that is a lift and shift of purely Microsoft Technology Office or proprietary because that can typically be done very well with the built-in Microsoft tooling. But when you think of any market share gain that might happen now from now on from Microsoft and the others, if you can imagine that, that would be a more cloud workloads, next-gen workloads, workloads that have to gather data and go into AI models, and these are things that we are very well positioned to capture.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Rangan: I was curious, Olivier, that the generative AI, is it merely a fact of just waiting for these workloads to come on? And since you have such a strong presence in infrastructure monitoring, these workloads will just run on these big clouds and you will optimize them? Or do you have to do something specific on the product side to tool Datadog to better handle these generative AI workload? And I have a follow-up question.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, so I think the -- clearly, there's going to be more productivity. And we -- the way this has played out in the past typically is you just end up generating more stuff and more mess. So basically, if one person can produce 10x more, you end up with 10x more stuff and that person will still not understand everything they've produced. So the way we imagine the future is companies are going to deliver a lot more functionality to their users a lot faster. They're going to solve a lot more problems in software. But the they won't be as tight and understanding from their engineering team as to what it is they've built and how they built it and what might break and what might be the corner cases that don't work and things like that. And that's consistent with what we can see people building with a copilot today and things like that. So they're very, very good for solving a small problem, but they don't help you build consistent code babies or didn't help you build software platforms like that, that is still out of reach. So the -- again, the way we see it in the future is we'll see our customers do a lot more, and they will still need help to catch up with everything they are doing. And we'll be the ones to do that for them.\nKasthuri Rangan: Got it. And also Microsoft talked about the anniversary effect of optimization that the headwinds would be less going forward, whereas AWS called out deceleration in the month of April. But it looks like your business is still steady in the month of April. So it's fair to say that you're sort of decoupling away from the AWS deceleration and maintaining its steady pace as far as consumption trends are concerned.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, I mean, look, we're -- for the rest of the year, we're not assuming any change in trajectory. So now in terms of where we are compared to the other cloud providers, I mean one thing you can do is you can look at the sequential growth numbers quarter-to-quarter. And you'll see that if you look at the 3 cloud manager providers, they've decelerated to about 1% quarter-to-quarter growth for the last quarter. We're still significantly higher than that. And when you look at our ARR, considering the fact that we ended -- we exited slower in '22 and we exited higher in end of Q1 because the quarter is actually differently around the holiday, we actually maintained an ARR that was already higher also than the -- on ARR growth that was higher than the -- sequentially than the cloud providers. So we already decoupled from the growth of the hyperscalers to a certain extent.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi.\nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Joel ] on for Fatima. So just to check in another vertical here. Given the continued uncertainty in the financial services vertical, just wondering if you could speak to your exposure here and perhaps any related behavior you're seeing with your customers, if at all? And then I just have a quick follow-up.\nOlivier Pomel: So we don't-- I don't think we'll have numbers to share on the exact exposure to financial services. Obviously, it's been a growing vertical for us as the financial services are early adopters of software. And I would say it's not necessarily earliest adopters of the cloud, but definitely adopter at scale today of cloud technology. We haven't seen any changes in customer behavior on that side. And that includes, when there were all this trouble -- we saw this trouble with SVB and other banks failing, we were still seeing great upticks from our products from their financial services, new logos as well as expansion deals. So nothing to report.\nUnknown Analyst: Okay. And then just -- you mentioned the expansion deal with a large fintech, which displaced open source software in addition to other tools. So I just wondered if you could speak to the competitive dynamics versus open source, especially in this cost-sensitive environment and why Datadog still wins and perhaps works as a consolidation destination.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. I mean the situation is very similar to what it's always been. It's -- we win because we deliver more value. It's -- at the end of the day, it works better and cheaper with what we do and what we provide than trying to build it yourself and mobilizing your own team and trying to stitch together different parts of open source. For some customers, they will still want part of that. They will still want to build somebody, that's more a cultural thing. But for the vast majority of customers, it's not a rational thing to do. And that's why we win in the end. The dynamic there is remarkably unchanged from -- I could have said the exact same thing 10 years ago. Obviously, the open source projects, we're different. Our footprint as the community was different, but the dynamics when we sold the customer was very, very similar.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Olivier, Earlier, you mentioned sort of the opportunity or your sort of focus on the Azure ecosystem. What types of things on a go-to-market perspective can you do to increase your penetration there as you've sort of historically been much larger inside of AWS?\nOlivier Pomel: So there's a lot of things we're doing, whether that's working directly with other cloud providers in addition to our very strong relationship with AWS, whether that's building more integration specifically to the ecosystem, technology integration. And if you look at our announcements, product announcements, you will see that we've done quite a bit in partnership with Azure and Microsoft, for example. And we -- part of it is also expanding our sales force in territories that tend to be -- to lean more towards Microsoft in terms of their tech stack. So when you look at the early customers we had, which tended to be a lot of software companies that used to be based on the West Coast in the U.S., these typically didn't lean hard Microsoft. But when we look at the more recent enterprise teams we started in the past few years, for example, in U.S. Central areas, like these tend to be way heavier on the Microsoft stack. So it's a combination of all of the above, basically. Like it's not just one single thing we do, it's a lot of different things at many levels to make sure that we have the right product to show in front of the -- it can be from the right customer and have the right sales force to renew that.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC.\nMatthew Hedberg: Thanks for the APM and log management data point, over $1 billion in ARR. I'm wondering, can you provide a frame of reference for maybe the growth of these 2 businesses versus core infrastructure? And maybe between the 2 APM logging, are they about equal in size? Or is one sort of relatively larger than the other?\nOlivier Pomel: Although it might look the same, I mean we're not going to give specific numbers there. But -- and the growth rates, of course, like the -- generally speaking, the smaller products grow faster than the products that are bigger than them. That's pretty much true over the whole set of products. The growth of all of the products have come down a little bit, especially the ones that have a lot of volume component, like, for example, logs, where if you -- when you think of optimization, like there is optimization that happens at the cloud provider level and there some that can happen at the observability level, too. Overwhelmingly, at the observability level, that's logged and everything that's for which customers have different knob to turn. For everything else, it's the utilization to where the cloud provide [indiscernible].\nMatthew Hedberg: Got it. And then on the outage that you referenced, the $5 million. I'm curious, what did you guys learn from that to prevent maybe this in the future? And outside of the $5 million hit that David talked about, are there any other repercussions from a customer perspective?\nOlivier Pomel: So well, we've made a lifetime of learning in a day. So that's the positive part of having an incident like that. I want to say I was personally very impressed by the response from our team. We shared some information on postmortem on what happened. I encourage everyone to read it because it's a fascinating document. But because of the very wide nature of this issue, we ended up having 3 shifts of 500 to 600 engineers working on this outage. And that worked -- that part worked beautifully. Obviously, we've learned about a number of things beyond the root cause of the outage that is almost anecdotal, like it's one of those small things that can have a big impact, but I don't worry so much about it happening again. What we've learned is more about the various things we can do better to recover faster for our systems and to provide a better way for our customers to mitigate an issue when that happens. So these are the most of the learnings and most of the new sources of work that we have internally to follow up on that to make sure that we reduce the chance of it happening again. And when it does, we will recover faster and better for our customers. Overall, a very humbling experience. And I want to make sure that we drive our customers in the future there. We don't see any long-term impact. The way we've handled it is by being very transparent with our customers about what was happening and addressing any possible consequences with them after that. And we think in those situations, when you do things right and when you don't repeat these mistakes too often, the effect is actually to strengthen the relationship with the customer. And I hope we succeed in doing that.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: David, just on the large customer adds, you were at 130 versus an average of 170 to 240 over the last 4 quarters. Any color there? Can you just talk to, is this just more customer selling because of the economy? Or is this execution-related? How would you the characterize the large enterprise traction?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. A couple of factors. One, first quarter is our seasonally lowest amount of new logo ARR. The first quarter this year was very similar. I think we said slightly higher than the year before and similar to our other quarters. That's one factor. Secondly, as we've talked about, most of our customers who are in that larger customer group aren't born there but expand into that. And when the organic growth rate goes down, you will naturally have a slower evolution or graduation of customers into that larger customer classification. So both of those factors caused that slowdown in accumulation of customers over $100,000.\nBrent Thill: And Olivier, just a quick follow-up on the cloud authorization solution. Are you -- can you give us a sense of the traction of what you're seeing in terms of adoption there?\nOlivier Pomel: Adjustment for what? Sorry, I missed the beginning of your question.\nBrent Thill: Even build a cloud optimization solution to help your customers identify where there's potential opportunities, are you seeing an uptake in that product?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, we're seeing extremely strong demand for that. And this is -- so this is definitely a product that customers want. And we -- and our immediate road map for it is very clear. So that's -- there's no doubt about it.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Koji Ikeda with Bank of America Securities.\nKoji Ikeda: Just one for me here in the interest of time. I wanted to ask you a question on the cloud security management platform and specifically the sales motion for it. So how is that shaping up this year? And how should we be thinking about the investments and strategy for that segment this year? And as you attack that opportunity, how has the competitive environment been shaping up as you head into deal bake-offs? Is it coming in as expected?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. There's no dramatic change from what we've seen before. Our focus is really on getting the product in as many hands as possible. And as we mentioned on the call, it's working. We have more than 5,000 customers on those products. And this is really what gives us the -- basically, closes the loop so that we can keep building those products and bring them all to maturity. The one thing I'll say is our strategy or approach for security is ambitious. We don't have -- we specifically are not trying to build a point solution, we're building -- which means we're moving in many different directions at the same time for this. And everything we do in terms of go-to-market and driving customer adoption for that is in service of this product development so we can build out that platform. So with that in mind, the go-to-market hasn't changed from what we've done before. And we tend to land heavily on crossing over from DevOps team into security, and that's working well to get a lot more customer adoption. On the community side, there's no big changes there. We see the same user suspects as before. The dynamics are a little bit different because they typically have narrower solution and more defined cell motions around those. And -- but we're very pleased with the customer adoption so far.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Olivier, you laid out a pretty compelling case for why generative AI will have a positive impact on Datadog and presumably the observability market at large, both over the near to medium term as well as long term. But do you see any offsets, any partial offsets from organizations having greater intelligence and automation at their fingertips? Are there certain workloads that may no longer need to be monitored by an observability platform?\nOlivier Pomel: Look, in the long-term future, everything is possible, but I don't think -- today, I don't think that's in the -- that's not what we hear or see. I think the -- again, the workloads are getting more complex as the integration management is getting better, and we see basically a continuation of that. So in terms of what customers do today, like it's hard to project the current adoption of AI into what it might look like into the future because right now, AI is mostly used as an API call for most companies. But we don't think it's necessarily going to be the case 1, 2 or 5 years now.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Got it. And then just for David, on the outage, are the credits, et cetera, is that now fully behind you? Or is there any lingering financial impact in the Q2 that you're embedding in the guide?\nDavid Obstler: Yes. We provide for what we know in our -- at time in our accruals. So we believe that we've provided for that through the revenue impact in Q1.\nOperator: Please standby for our last question. The last question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham.\nMichael Cikos: I guess a question for Oli. The first question is really around the ARR discussion. I appreciate the color you guys provided around that APM and log management. Can you highlight -- is Datadog winning new customers on pure APM and logging at this point? Or is infrastructure still the heavy lean as far as where those new logos are being predominantly won? And then secondarily, can you talk to maybe some of the newer products in the portfolio which you're seeing the strongest uptake today, just given we have, I think, it's 17-plus modules in the portfolio more broadly? Just where would -- where should we be focusing when thinking about growth going forward from here?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So look, motion is still to land with infrastructure, as you know, PMO and our logs when we start. I would say it's getting increasingly difficult to separate all of those because those market in general is converging and to -- I think, all 3 under 1 roof. So it's -- whether customers start the conversation about APM or logs, whether they start over from infrastructure, it doesn't matter a ton when we land new customers. I would say though that we definitely have best-of-breed products also in APM and logs, knowing those products win on their own. And sometimes when we enter a new customer that we already have solutions for other things, we can start by displacing a vendor on the APM side or the log side and expect from there. That's definitely something that we do on a regular basis. On the question of the products that are growing the fastest, like the -- so all the newer products are actually getting pretty good uptake. So it's hard to pick one. I mentioned earlier, so cloud cost optimization is actually a very popular product right now. Still very early [indiscernible], but it's a very popular product. And we also see a lot of interest actually for some of the new products we announced at the ASH last year, and some of which are still not generally available. So there's a number of things we're doing in terms of estimating response to issues and workflows and sorting through issues and managing issues for our life cycle that are getting a lot of attention from customers to that, too. So we're excited about what's coming next. Obviously, the expectation for some of those products are changing over time, too. Not everyone can see what can be done with AI. Everybody expects to see a lot more of that. So I guess we'll share more on that in the near future.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Olivier for closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: Thank you. I want to thank again all -- everyone at Datadog for crossing these really important milestones. Obviously, we're already focused on the next ones. But I want to thank everyone for their hard work, shipping product, getting in front of customers. I also want to thank our team for responding to that system outage we had and our customers for very kindly working with us through that. And on this, I will speak to you again after Q2.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution in Q1 as we continued broadening our platform, delivering new use cases for our existing users as well as signing up more customers, all on the backdrop of continued macro uncertainty and optimization of cloud workloads. Let me start with a review of our Q1 financial performance. In Q1, revenue was $482 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Note that this number factors in the impact of a service outage we experienced in March and which reduced our revenue for the quarter by about $5 million. We ended with about 25,500 customers, up from about 19,800 last year. Also note that we are now including customers who joined following our acquisition of Cloudcraft, representing about 1,400 net new customers to Datadog this quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,910 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,250 last year. The customers generated about 85% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $116 million, with a free cash flow margin of 24%. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 81% of customers were using 2 or more products, in line with last year. 43% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 35% a year ago. And 19% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 12% last year. Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we experienced business conditions that were similar to the previous several quarters. In Q1, user's growth from existing customers came in roughly as expected. We saw existing customer users growth in Q1 improved from the levels we saw in Q4, but remain a bit lower than the levels we experienced in Q2 and Q3. And as in recent quarters, we continue to see customers optimize their cloud spend, particularly those further along in their cloud migration and hosting a larger portion of their infrastructure in the cloud. Additionally, our new logo acquisition and bookings in Q1 were solid for what is a seasonally slower quarter. New local bookings reached a new record for Q1 and were up slightly from last year as we continued to add many promising new logos, which I'll discuss in a bit. With our land and expand model, we expect many of these new logos will turn into much larger customers as they add up more of our products over time. Despite a more cost-conscious demand environment, we have continued to land new customers and expand existing ones, and we are very proud to achieve several key milestones in Q1. So first, our total ARR exceeded $2 billion for the first time, a true achievement for all of us at Datadog even though we all know we're only getting started. Second, our APM suite and log management products together exceeded $1 billion in ARR. This demonstrates the expansion of our business well beyond our [indiscernible] monitoring product and our successful execution on the broad of the mobility platform. Remember that our APM suite includes 4 Datadog products: core APM, Synthetics, Real User monitoring and Continuous profile. Third, we continue to make steady progress with our cloud security products with continued growth in ARR and in customers. And I'm very pleased to announce that we now have more than 5,000 customers using our cloud security products. Now let's move on to R&D. We introduced a number of new security capabilities last month. We announced the general availability of Application Vulnerability Management, which provides visibility into the attack surface of production environment by automatically surfacing vulnerabilities. And instead of submerging users with thousands upon thousands of vulnerabilities, this new functionality is observability data to prioritize risks based on the estimated impact to the business and closes the loop between security, operations and development teams. We also introduced a number of new capabilities to our Cloud Security Management product. Workload security profiles allow customers to flag anomalous activity and improve overall accuracy of threat detection directly within the workload. And we now offer vulnerability detection for containers, automatically scanning live container images for known vulnerabilities. Now moving on from security to observability, we also announced the general availability of Data Streams Monitoring. These products specifically targets queuing, streaming and even driven pipelines, such as Kafka or RabbitMQ. These systems often span many different teams and technologies and are notoriously difficult to manage and troubleshoot. And for this, even standard APM and log management solutions are not specialized enough. Data Streams Monitoring automatically identifies the topology, interdependencies and key metrics of complex streaming data pipelines, allowing customers to maintain availability, correctness and latency for what is now a critical part of their business. Lastly, we were thrilled to unveil our newest data center in Japan last month. We see a large opportunity to serve our customers in the Asia Pacific region, which have seen significant growth over time and now represents high single digits as a percent of revenue. I also want to take a moment and share our excitement for the latest wave of AI innovation. And I'm going to use AI in this community here to refer to the recent advances in deep learning, large language models and generative AI. First, from a market perspective, over the long term, we believe AI will significantly expand our opportunity in observability and beyond. We seek massive improvements in developer productivity will allow individuals to write more applications and to do so faster than ever before. And as with past productivity increases, we think this will further shift value from writing code to observing, managing, fixing and securing live applications. In the short to medium term, we believe the rise of AI will increase the demand for compute and storage to train and run models, but it will also increase the value of proprietary data and further drive digital transformation and cloud migration as these  are all prerequisites for adoption. We also do expect quite a bit of noise in the market as the technology stack is progressing and changing very quickly. Now from a product perspective, we believe that we at Datadog are uniquely positioned to deliver value to our customers in this new world. First, we built Datadog from day 1 as a pure SaaS business precisely to be able to put our data to work at full scale and to train models to solve our customers' problems. Second, our large assets of contact with our customers gives us the insertion points to make AI relevant. This is where we see the value of having a variable customer base and being designed to be used every day by every single engineer. And third, we serve today some of the largest builders and consumers of AI services and are quickly adapting to their needs in a rapidly changing field. So in other words, we are really excited about the potential of AI for us and for the observability and security market, and I'm sure we'll discuss this topic further in the future. Okay. Let's move on to sales and marketing. As I said earlier, our go-to-market teams had another productive quarter. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed an expansion into 8 figures ARR with a leading AI company. This customer saw an order of magnitude increase in user demand and a third in new customers following enormous innovation and interest in generative AI. As a result, this customer now uses 6 Datadog products and relies on our platform to track and correlate key business metrics, ranging from uptime data to newer subscriptions and revenue. Next, we signed a high 7 figures expansion to another 8-figure ARR deal with one of the world's largest fintech companies. This customer has expanded meaningfully over time, and today see Datadog platform used by thousands of users across dozens of business units. With this expansion, this customer now uses 14 Datadog products and is consolidating multiple open source, homegrown and commercial tools across observability and security into the Datadog platform. Next, we signed a 7-figure expansion with a Fortune 500 health care company. Before using Datadog, major incidents would mobilize up to 150 employees for an average of 3 to 4 hours. With Datadog, they only need 20 employees for about 30 minutes with an opportunity to further reduce these numbers. I will note that we're also replacing a commercial observability competitor whose new pricing model was causing an increase in cost with lower value. This customer now expects to save more than $0.5 million every year by moving that to Datadog across several business units. Next, we signed a 6-figure land with a multinational clothing company. This company was previously heavily siloed, with each team using different monitoring tools. And as is often the case, this caused issues impacting revenue and customer experience. This customer is starting with 5 Datadog products and expect to consolidate and replace a total of 13 commercial and open-source tools with Datadog. And last but not least, we signed a 7-figure multiyear land with a leading university in Australia. This customer has historically relied on open source solutions. They evaluated a few commercial competitors, and Datadog won as their requirements involve both cloud and on-premise across logs, user experience and network device monitoring. This customer plans over time to migrate from more than 10 tools to the Datadog platform. And that's it for this quarter's highlights. I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams again for their continued execution in Q1. Now switching gears. Let me speak to our longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change to the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We do continue to see customers optimizing their cloud usage, and visibility remains limited as to when this optimization cycle will end, but we firmly believe it will. As before, we remain confident that we will continue to deliver value to more customers in their digital transformation and cloud migration journeys. And it is increasingly clear with each wave of technical innovation that every company in every industry and every geographic region has to take advantage of the cloud, microservices, container and generative AI and more. By relentlessly broadening the Datadog platform, we will continue to help our customers save on costs, execute with better engineering efficiency, drive competitive differentiation and deliver value to their own customers. So our long-term plans have not changed. We are continuing to invest to capture our long-term opportunities. And as David will discuss in a moment, the strength of our business model allows us to balance that with delivering financial performance. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David? Yes. I mean, the short of it is we don't know exactly yet. So we -- and I'm going to give an answer that's going to be very similar to the answer I gave last quarter, but we see customers taking another bite at their own workforce, like we saw it in a number of companies this morning actually even. So I don't think customers themselves know where they are done. So we're very prudent in terms of assuming an end to it in the near future. So when we look at our data, when we look at the -- what we hear from the hyperscalers also, we also listen carefully to their commentary on what they foresee in the near future. We don't see anything that gives us confidence that we can call an end to optimization next quarter or the quarter after that. So as far as our guidance goes and our plans for the year, we assume that this is going to continue at a similar level for the rest of the year. Now obviously, when we look at our customer base, we see some customers that obviously seem to be done with it and others that haven't done anything. So we try to keep an eye on that and model it, but we're not including any of that in our guidance. Yes. So first, I'd say it's a -- [indiscernible], it's fascinating time to be alive, to see all these, rapid innovation in the world of AI. The first thing I'd say is that it's still fairly early in terms of what the market going to look like in the AI world. Right now, there's one particular thing that's been -- that used to be very hard, which was building conventional models and chat bots and things like that, which almost overnight became almost a commodity basically. Anybody can incorporate it in any application. It's an API call away, and there is even a number of different options, commercial open source you can use today. So that just happened. That one has massive traction. You see it everywhere. But it also is opening the gate to many, many more, I would say, more customized, deeper applications on AI that may be built by a few vendors or may be built by a large number of companies instead, it's not quite clear yet. What we see on our end is that it's going to drive more compute, it's going to drive more value in the data that is being gathered by companies. It's going to drive digital transformation. It's going to drive cloud migration because, again, you can't actually adopt AI unless you have the data. You can't actually adopt it without having a modern architecture and an application you can scale up and down and infrastructure you can quickly provision and de-provision. You need to capture all of your -- to capture your data, you need to be digitally transformed. So you have data of all your customer interactions and everything that is proper to your business. So in the mid-term, we see that as a very clear accelerant to our business. Maybe with a little bit of noise, as I mentioned on the script earlier, in terms of what technologies end up being the winning ones and what technologies end up being sizzling after a few years, because it's still -- it's so early and there's so much innovation that out of 200 new things, there's probably only 10 or 20 that will matter to you somehow, but it's hard to know which ones are today. So short answer is, mid-term, a lot more of the current workloads, the types of workloads we see maybe with different sets of technologies. Longer term, I think we can all glimpse at the future where productivity for everyone, including software engineers, increases dramatically. And the way we see that as a business is, our job is to help our customers absorb the complexity of the applications they've built so they can understand and modify them, run them, secure them. And we think that the more productivity there is, the more people can write in the amount of time. The less they understand the software they produce and the more they need us, the more value it sends our way. So that's what makes us very confident in the long term here. So I would say April is broadly consistent with what we've seen in Q4 and Q1. I think it's -- there's no major difference to call out there. And it's too early also for us to call the quarter, obviously. So there's nothing very sharp to point out about April. On the customer optimization, Look, we have a large number of customers that are early in their cloud migration, early in the Datadog adoption and that are growing very fast. We haven't seen any optimization from those customers. It's possible we see optimization from some of those, which is why we remain very careful in our in our guidance. We don't assume basically that the optimization will stop at the customers that already have done it, and that the rest of the customer base is going to be fine after that. And look, this is one of the situations where this customer was in an industry that -- vertical that got pretty much decimated over the past year. And their own business was cut in 3 or 4 in terms of their revenue. And when that's the case, that we really work with customers to restructure their contract with us. We want to be part of the solution for them, not part of the problem. And that's what we did here, we restructured that contract. So we kept them as a happy customer for many more years and do deal that works for everyone with their business profile. It's too early to tell. And by the way, it's a bit hard to just project our numbers from the -- this is just a reminder, it's hard to project our numbers from the numbers of the cloud providers because it's not a one-to-one in terms of what they report and what concerns the infrastructure and the applications directly. Different cloud providers have different things in there. And also, these vendors have -- in addition to the volumes that drive consumption on our end, they also have their own pricing dynamics. And typically, in those situations, the vendors with the largest bills are the ones that get pushed the most. So in this case, that would be AWS. But in terms of what we see in our data, there's no -- nothing to suggest that any particular cloud is recovering from optimization just yet. We also tried to read the hyperscaler comments. And depending on what you've read before and after, they look more or less positive, so I'm not quite sure I would project as much enthusiasm in the Microsoft comment. But what we know is that, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter for us. We're equally well positioned to capture workloads on Azure as we are on AWS and GCP. And the only part I would say of the Microsoft stack that we don't cover as well is everything that is a lift and shift of purely Microsoft Technology Office or proprietary because that can typically be done very well with the built-in Microsoft tooling. But when you think of any market share gain that might happen now from now on from Microsoft and the others, if you can imagine that, that would be a more cloud workloads, next-gen workloads, workloads that have to gather data and go into AI models, and these are things that we are very well positioned to capture. Well, so I think the -- clearly, there's going to be more productivity. And we -- the way this has played out in the past typically is you just end up generating more stuff and more mess. So basically, if one person can produce 10x more, you end up with 10x more stuff and that person will still not understand everything they've produced. So the way we imagine the future is companies are going to deliver a lot more functionality to their users a lot faster. They're going to solve a lot more problems in software. But the they won't be as tight and understanding from their engineering team as to what it is they've built and how they built it and what might break and what might be the corner cases that don't work and things like that. And that's consistent with what we can see people building with a copilot today and things like that. So they're very, very good for solving a small problem, but they don't help you build consistent code babies or didn't help you build software platforms like that, that is still out of reach. So the -- again, the way we see it in the future is we'll see our customers do a lot more, and they will still need help to catch up with everything they are doing. And we'll be the ones to do that for them. Well, I mean, look, we're -- for the rest of the year, we're not assuming any change in trajectory. So now in terms of where we are compared to the other cloud providers, I mean one thing you can do is you can look at the sequential growth numbers quarter-to-quarter. And you'll see that if you look at the 3 cloud manager providers, they've decelerated to about 1% quarter-to-quarter growth for the last quarter. We're still significantly higher than that. And when you look at our ARR, considering the fact that we ended -- we exited slower in '22 and we exited higher in end of Q1 because the quarter is actually differently around the holiday, we actually maintained an ARR that was already higher also than the -- on ARR growth that was higher than the -- sequentially than the cloud providers. So we already decoupled from the growth of the hyperscalers to a certain extent. So we don't-- I don't think we'll have numbers to share on the exact exposure to financial services. Obviously, it's been a growing vertical for us as the financial services are early adopters of software. And I would say it's not necessarily earliest adopters of the cloud, but definitely adopter at scale today of cloud technology. We haven't seen any changes in customer behavior on that side. And that includes, when there were all this trouble -- we saw this trouble with SVB and other banks failing, we were still seeing great upticks from our products from their financial services, new logos as well as expansion deals. So nothing to report. Yes. I mean the situation is very similar to what it's always been. It's -- we win because we deliver more value. It's -- at the end of the day, it works better and cheaper with what we do and what we provide than trying to build it yourself and mobilizing your own team and trying to stitch together different parts of open source. For some customers, they will still want part of that. They will still want to build somebody, that's more a cultural thing. But for the vast majority of customers, it's not a rational thing to do. And that's why we win in the end. The dynamic there is remarkably unchanged from -- I could have said the exact same thing 10 years ago. Obviously, the open source projects, we're different. Our footprint as the community was different, but the dynamics when we sold the customer was very, very similar. So there's a lot of things we're doing, whether that's working directly with other cloud providers in addition to our very strong relationship with AWS, whether that's building more integration specifically to the ecosystem, technology integration. And if you look at our announcements, product announcements, you will see that we've done quite a bit in partnership with Azure and Microsoft, for example. And we -- part of it is also expanding our sales force in territories that tend to be -- to lean more towards Microsoft in terms of their tech stack. So when you look at the early customers we had, which tended to be a lot of software companies that used to be based on the West Coast in the U.S., these typically didn't lean hard Microsoft. But when we look at the more recent enterprise teams we started in the past few years, for example, in U.S. Central areas, like these tend to be way heavier on the Microsoft stack. So it's a combination of all of the above, basically. Like it's not just one single thing we do, it's a lot of different things at many levels to make sure that we have the right product to show in front of the -- it can be from the right customer and have the right sales force to renew that. Although it might look the same, I mean we're not going to give specific numbers there. But -- and the growth rates, of course, like the -- generally speaking, the smaller products grow faster than the products that are bigger than them. That's pretty much true over the whole set of products. The growth of all of the products have come down a little bit, especially the ones that have a lot of volume component, like, for example, logs, where if you -- when you think of optimization, like there is optimization that happens at the cloud provider level and there some that can happen at the observability level, too. Overwhelmingly, at the observability level, that's logged and everything that's for which customers have different knob to turn. For everything else, it's the utilization to where the cloud provide [indiscernible]. So well, we've made a lifetime of learning in a day. So that's the positive part of having an incident like that. I want to say I was personally very impressed by the response from our team. We shared some information on postmortem on what happened. I encourage everyone to read it because it's a fascinating document. But because of the very wide nature of this issue, we ended up having 3 shifts of 500 to 600 engineers working on this outage. And that worked -- that part worked beautifully. Obviously, we've learned about a number of things beyond the root cause of the outage that is almost anecdotal, like it's one of those small things that can have a big impact, but I don't worry so much about it happening again. What we've learned is more about the various things we can do better to recover faster for our systems and to provide a better way for our customers to mitigate an issue when that happens. So these are the most of the learnings and most of the new sources of work that we have internally to follow up on that to make sure that we reduce the chance of it happening again. And when it does, we will recover faster and better for our customers. Overall, a very humbling experience. And I want to make sure that we drive our customers in the future there. We don't see any long-term impact. The way we've handled it is by being very transparent with our customers about what was happening and addressing any possible consequences with them after that. And we think in those situations, when you do things right and when you don't repeat these mistakes too often, the effect is actually to strengthen the relationship with the customer. And I hope we succeed in doing that. Adjustment for what? Sorry, I missed the beginning of your question. Yes, we're seeing extremely strong demand for that. And this is -- so this is definitely a product that customers want. And we -- and our immediate road map for it is very clear. So that's -- there's no doubt about it. Yes. There's no dramatic change from what we've seen before. Our focus is really on getting the product in as many hands as possible. And as we mentioned on the call, it's working. We have more than 5,000 customers on those products. And this is really what gives us the -- basically, closes the loop so that we can keep building those products and bring them all to maturity. The one thing I'll say is our strategy or approach for security is ambitious. We don't have -- we specifically are not trying to build a point solution, we're building -- which means we're moving in many different directions at the same time for this. And everything we do in terms of go-to-market and driving customer adoption for that is in service of this product development so we can build out that platform. So with that in mind, the go-to-market hasn't changed from what we've done before. And we tend to land heavily on crossing over from DevOps team into security, and that's working well to get a lot more customer adoption. On the community side, there's no big changes there. We see the same user suspects as before. The dynamics are a little bit different because they typically have narrower solution and more defined cell motions around those. And -- but we're very pleased with the customer adoption so far. Look, in the long-term future, everything is possible, but I don't think -- today, I don't think that's in the -- that's not what we hear or see. I think the -- again, the workloads are getting more complex as the integration management is getting better, and we see basically a continuation of that. So in terms of what customers do today, like it's hard to project the current adoption of AI into what it might look like into the future because right now, AI is mostly used as an API call for most companies. But we don't think it's necessarily going to be the case 1, 2 or 5 years now. Yes. So look, motion is still to land with infrastructure, as you know, PMO and our logs when we start. I would say it's getting increasingly difficult to separate all of those because those market in general is converging and to -- I think, all 3 under 1 roof. So it's -- whether customers start the conversation about APM or logs, whether they start over from infrastructure, it doesn't matter a ton when we land new customers. I would say though that we definitely have best-of-breed products also in APM and logs, knowing those products win on their own. And sometimes when we enter a new customer that we already have solutions for other things, we can start by displacing a vendor on the APM side or the log side and expect from there. That's definitely something that we do on a regular basis. On the question of the products that are growing the fastest, like the -- so all the newer products are actually getting pretty good uptake. So it's hard to pick one. I mentioned earlier, so cloud cost optimization is actually a very popular product right now. Still very early [indiscernible], but it's a very popular product. And we also see a lot of interest actually for some of the new products we announced at the ASH last year, and some of which are still not generally available. So there's a number of things we're doing in terms of estimating response to issues and workflows and sorting through issues and managing issues for our life cycle that are getting a lot of attention from customers to that, too. So we're excited about what's coming next. Obviously, the expectation for some of those products are changing over time, too. Not everyone can see what can be done with AI. Everybody expects to see a lot more of that. So I guess we'll share more on that in the near future. Thank you. I want to thank again all -- everyone at Datadog for crossing these really important milestones. Obviously, we're already focused on the next ones. But I want to thank everyone for their hard work, shipping product, getting in front of customers. I also want to thank our team for responding to that system outage we had and our customers for very kindly working with us through that. And on this, I will speak to you again after Q2."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. In Q1, we continued to execute well and deliver value to our customers. Revenue was $482 million, up 33% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-to-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q1 performance. First, we had an unusual outage in March, and we estimate that the impact to our revenues from that outage to be about $5 million. As we mentioned last quarter, we saw subdued usage growth in the month of December which created a lower growth trajectory to start the first quarter and drove seasonally weaker sequential growth in the first quarter. During Q1, we experienced a linearity pattern that is typical for us, which included usage growth in March that was higher than that in January and February. Overall, we saw existing customer usage growth in Q1 improved from the levels we saw in Q4, though it was slightly lower than the levels we experienced in Q2 and Q3 last year. Next, we continue to see larger spending customers grow smaller -- grow slower than smaller-spending customers. From an industry perspective, we continue to see the slowest growth in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food delivery. Geographically, we saw faster year-over-year growth in international than in North America. Our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate, or NRR, continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted more products. Based on our current growth trajectory, however, we expect our trailing 12-month NRR to be below 130% in Q2. While our net retention rate is expected to go below 130%, we continue to execute strongly on our platform innovation and our land and expand business model, as evidenced by our latest product announcements, our expanding cross-sell products and the examples of the strong Q1 renewals that Olivier discussed. Our dollar-based gross retention rate remained stable in the mid- to high 90s, an indication of the mission-critical nature of the Datadog platform for our customers. Now moving on to our financial results. Billings were $511 million, up 15% year-over-year. We had a large upfront bill for a client in Q1 '22 that did not recur at the same level or timing in Q1 '23. Pro forma for this client, billings growth was in the low 30s percent year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO, was $1.14 billion, up 33% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the high 20s percent year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $388 million, representing a gross margin of 80.5%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.6% last quarter and 80.4% in the year ago quarter. We continued to experience efficiencies in cloud costs, reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the mid- to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s percent range. Our Q1 non-GAAP OpEx grew 45% year-over-year. This is a decline from 54% year-over-year growth in the previous quarter. We continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market, but at a more moderate pace than last year. Q1 operating income was $86 million or an 18% operating margin, flat sequentially to Q4 2022 margin also of 18%. In the year ago quarter, operating margins was 23%, and it benefited from lack of in-person office, travel and event costs due to our COVID policies during the pandemic. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $134 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $116 million for a free cash flow margin of 24%. Now for our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continued to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers compared to historical periods. And as usual, we are basing our near-term guidance on recent activity we see with our customers. While existing customers are still expanding with us, we continue to assume in our guidance that cloud optimization is affecting their expansion rate for the rest of 2023. For the second quarter, as a result, we expect revenue to be in the range of $498 million to $502 million, which represents 23% to 24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $82 million to $86 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.27 to $0.29 per share range based on approximately 349 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.10 billion, which represents 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.20 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Some additional notes in our guidance. First, we have continued to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large, long-term opportunities, and we are executing well on our plans to invest efficiently. We expect the continued moderation of headcount growth, and the lapping of the COVID-affected historical expenses to result in continued slowing of OpEx growth during the remainder of 2023. We now plan to grow our non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding COGS, in fiscal year 2023 by approximately 30% year-over-year with an exit rate in Q4 in the low 20s percent year-over-year. We continue to expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $75 million. And we expect our tax expense in fiscal year 2023 to be in the range of $14 million to $16 million. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the range of 4% to 5% of revenues in fiscal year 2023. Now finally, to reiterate Olivier's comments, we remain excited about our long-term opportunities as our customers embark and expand on their cloud migration and digital transformation plans. We are continuing to invest to further expand the ways we reach our customers and help them along these journeys. I want to thank our Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in this quarter. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Thanks. Yes, I would say that we've made substantial and consistent investments both in our go-to-market and our R&D over the last few years. And this year, we're balancing -- continuing to do that with 2 things, with prioritization as well as injecting some optimization or efficiency into the investments we had made. We're seeing the opportunity to get returns from the previous investments and to think through a little more the prioritization of those. Yes. We -- that is a customer of ours. What we said was the billing frequency changed and the size. So that customer's bill will, one, be spread out more over time. That company -- that was a crypto company and continues to be a customer of ours, but that was an early optimizer. We had always talked that some of the industries that were most affected optimized. And that is -- so we will get that -- we will get that bill at a smaller size than was billed last year in a more of a chunked up billing way. In our company - since we've been public, we've pointed out when we have an unusual bill. So we don't have multiple of these types of situations. And what we've done, if you look back to our commentary, is when we've had one of those, a change of timing or a change of the duration of a bill or a size of a bill. We've tried to pro forma it in order to give everyone a sense of what the rest of the business is doing. Yes. A couple of factors. One, first quarter is our seasonally lowest amount of new logo ARR. The first quarter this year was very similar. I think we said slightly higher than the year before and similar to our other quarters. That's one factor. Secondly, as we've talked about, most of our customers who are in that larger customer group aren't born there but expand into that. And when the organic growth rate goes down, you will naturally have a slower evolution or graduation of customers into that larger customer classification. So both of those factors caused that slowdown in accumulation of customers over $100,000. Yes. We provide for what we know in our -- at time in our accruals. So we believe that we've provided for that through the revenue impact in Q1."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks Yuka and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report an -- Q3 as we continued to execute against our goals to help our customers grow faster, safer, and more efficient as the modernized application. We kept broadening our platform in observability and beyond, including in next gen AI where interest continues to rise. And we added new customers while expanding with existing ones as they grow into the cloud. Let me start with a review of our Q3 financial performance. Revenue was $690 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 29,200 customers, up from about 26,800 a year ago. We had about 3,490 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 3,130 a year ago. And these customers generated about 88% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $204 million with a free cash flow margin of 30%. Turning to platform adoption, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q3, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 82% a year ago. 49% of customers were using four or more products, up from 46% a year ago. 26% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 21% a year ago. And 12% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 8% a year ago. We continue to execute on growth across the three pillars of observability and we are pleased to report that infrastructure monitoring or APM suite and log management together, represent more than $2.5 billion in ARR. As a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, synthetics, real user monitoring, and continuous profiler. We also want to call out our newer products, which are increasingly contributing to our business. Of our 23 products, 15 now exceeded $10 million in ARR. These include even more classical product, as well as CI visibility and cloud cost management. So we have many products beginning to contribute to our revenue growth, and we're continuing to build greater capabilities within those products for our customers. Now, let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, the business environment for Datadog has remained stable, and similar to what we have seen throughout 2024. Our customers overall are growing their cloud usage, while some are continuing to be cost-conscious. In Q3, we continue to see existing customer usage growth broadly in line with our expectations. Our usage growth with existing customers continued to be higher than in the year ago quarter. And we saw healthy growth across our product lines, with newer products growing faster and more mature products of a smaller base. Finally, churn continues to be low, and growth revenue retention was stable in the mid to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers. Moving on to R&D. In the next gen AI space, customers continued to experiment with new AI technologies and as they do, they want to get visibility into their AI use. At the end of Q3, about 3,000 customers use one or more Datadog AI integrations to send us data about their AI, machine learning, and LLM usage. As some of these experiments start turning into production AI applications, we are seeing initial signs of traction for our LLM observability product. Today, hundreds of customers are using LLM observability, with more exploring it every day. And some of our first paying customers have told us that they have cut the time spent investigating LLM latency errors and quality from days of hours to just minutes. Our customers don't only want to understand the performance and cost of the LLM applications, they also want to understand LLM model performance within the context of their entire application. So they are using APM alongside LLM observability to get fully integrated end to end visibility across all the applications and text acts. Meanwhile, we continue to work to make the Datadog platform the best place for customers to monitor secure and take action on their systems, no matter where they deploy. In September, we launched Datadog monitoring for Oracle Cloud infrastructure for general availability. With this launch, our customers get visibility into their OCI stack and they can manage in real time the performance of OCI cloud services, servers, VMs, databases, containers, and apps in Datadog. And customers can now unify their monitoring across OCI, other clouds, and open environments. We also continue to expand our platform in new ways to bring value to our customers. At our Dash User Conference this summer, we announced Datadog on call our newest product in the cloud service management space. As you know, our customers use Datadog extensively during their work days for alerting and troubleshooting, whether that's for observability or security use cases. Now, with Datadog On Call, we are bringing a modern paging experience directly into our unified platform. And we know for a completely integrated solution that covers incidents from end to end, from detection, alerting, and paging, to incident management, troubleshooting, and resolution. Even though On Call is still in limited availability, we are already seeing very strong reception for the product, and we are beginning to see customers with what's on call as part of their deals. In particular, new customers are interested in including paging as part of their LAN with Datadog. So we're working hard to deepen and broaden our platform. And our innovations are rightfully being recognized by independent research firms. We are pleased to see that for the fourth year in a row, Datadog has been named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for observability platforms. We believe that this validates our approach to deliver unified platform, which breaks down silos across teams. And Datadog has also been named a leader in Gartner's very first Magic Quadrant for digital experience monitoring, which includes Datadog\u2019s products across synthetic testing, real user monitoring, product analytics, session replay, and error tracking. Now, let's move on to sales and marketing. Our sales team continue to execute this quarter, and we added some exciting new customers while expanding with many more. So let's go through a few examples. First, we'll need a seven-figure annualized deal with the leading e-commerce company in India. With its previous observatory vendor, the customers so quickly increasing costs while lacking the enterprise-grade observability they needed. By switching to Datadog, they expect to support their goals, and we'll rely for that for tracing, granular profiling, and cloud integration support. I will note that we are pleased to have landed a large new logo customer in India, and we are continuing to invest to grow our presence and our opportunities there. Next, we signed a six-figure annualized land with a major U.S. federal agency. This agency is beginning to move some of its workloads to the cloud, and is expanding the service it offers to every single U.S. citizen through cloud applications. They have chosen Datadog to observe and secure their cloud environment, and deliver a faster, better experience to end users. This deal includes eight products on Datadog cloud, including cloud seed and cloud security management. Next, we're going to need a seven-figure annualized deal with a large American financial services company. This customer has a very seasonal business, and experiences thousands of major incidents during the annual peak season, with an average downtime per incident of about five hours. And they estimate millions of dollars of lost revenue for each hour of downtime. By replacing its cloud provider's monitoring through the Datadog and in particular, using a realism monitoring product, this customer targets substantial reductions in downtime. They are starting with five Datadog products and are trailing on network monitoring, database monitoring, cloud security, and cloud cost management products, as they look to consider that dozens of homegrown commercial tools. Next, we'll need a seven-figure annualized expansion with a major airline in Europe. This customer has adopted Datadog\u2019s for its customer-facing website. They are now moving hundreds of applications from on-prem to AWS, and they want to de-risk their cloud migration. They estimate that each incident can cost tens of millions of dollars in loss-revenue and customer impact. By using Datadog across five products, this customer expects to significantly improve mean time resolution, and have already seen progress in that respect during our evaluation period with Datadog. Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a division of a hyper-scaler that will bring next-gen AI models. This customer is very technically capable, and already has a homegrown observity solution which requires time-consuming customization and manual configuration. They will be launching new features for their large language more soon, and need a platform that can scale flexibly for supporting proactive incident detection. By expanding the use of Datadog, they expect to efficiently onboard new teams in the environment and support the rapidly increasing adoption of data. Next and last, we find a seven-figure annualized expansion with a leading online food delivery company in Latin America. Before Datadog, this customer suffered from excessive alerting noise, silo teams, and lack of visibility, with each minute of downtime resulting in thousands of loss orders. By using Datadog, this customer has experienced meaningful reductions in mean-time-to-resolution and false alerts, while sitting on hard costs in the community's environment. This customer is expanding to 10 products in the Datadog platform. And that is it for another productive quarter from our go-to market team. Now let me say a few words on a longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change to the multi-year trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration, which we continue to believe are still in early days. We are seeing continued experimentation with new advances, such as next-gen AI. We believe this is one of the many factors that will drive greater use of the cloud and other modern technologies. So we are helping our customers every day to observe, secure, and act on their business critical applications and workloads. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, David.\nDavid Obstler: Thanks Olivier and good morning. Q3 revenue was $690 million, up 26% year-over-year, and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of our Q3 revenue growth, overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing customers that were consistent with our expectation. We've seen conditions remain roughly stable throughout 2024, with continued movement to cloud and modern DevOps technologies, and with customers remaining cost-conscious and seeking efficiency and value from their spend. In Q3, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than usage growth in the year ago quarter, as well as higher than usage growth in the prior quarter. Now, some of our growth is coming from AI native customers, who this quarter represented more than 6% of our Q3 ARR, up from more than 4% in Q2 and about 2.5% of our ARR in the year-ago quarter. AI native customers contributed about 4 percentage points of year-over-year growth in Q3 versus about 2 percentage points in the year-ago quarter. While we believe that adoption of AI will continue to benefit Datadog in the long term, we are mindful that some of the large customers in this cohort have ramped extremely rapidly, and that these customers may optimize cloud and observability usage and increase their commitments to us over time with better terms. This may create volatility in our revenue growth in future quarters on the backdrop of long-term volume growth. Now, regarding usage growth by customer size in Q3, similar to the last quarter, we saw the strongest performance among our largest customers who spent multiple millions of dollars with us annually. And as we looked at usage growth by segment, similar to recent quarters, we are seeing the strongest growth from our enterprise customers, where year-over-year growth in usage has accelerated over the past several quarters. Meanwhile, our SMB customers remain solid, with year-over-year growth similar to the past several quarters. As a reminder, we define enterprise customers as our clients with 5,000 employees or more, mid-market customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees, and SMB customers as those companies with less than 1,000 employees. Regarding our retention metrics, our net revenue retention percentage was in the mid-110s in Q3, with continued improvement from last quarter. This is a trailing 12-month measure. Meanwhile, we have continued to see an increase in recent quarters as we look at the NRR quarterly trend. And finally, our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remains stable in the mid-to-high 90s. Now moving on to our financial results. First, buildings were $689 million, up 14% year-over-year. Billings duration decreased slightly year-over-year. Pro forma for changes in billing timing and the slight change in duration, billings growth would have been in the mid-20% range. Our billings and billings growth can be volatile on a quarterly basis depending on the timing of our deals. Our 12-month trailing billing growth is similar to our trailing 12-month revenue growth with both in the mid-20%. Remaining performance obligations or RPO was $1.82 billion up 26% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the high 20% year-over-year. RPO duration was down slightly year-over-year. Normalizing for duration, RPO growth would have been in the high 30% year-over-year. We continue to believe that revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billing an RPO as those fluctuate on a quarterly basis relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $560 million, representing a gross margin of 81.1%. This compares to a gross margin of 82.1% last quarter and 82.3% in the year ago quarter. Our Q3 OPEX grew 21% year-over-year, the same growth as last quarter, although it would have represented an acceleration from last quarter, excluding the impact of our Dash user conference in Q2. As we have said before, we are investing in headcount in 2024 and the acceleration and OPEX reflects our execution on our hiring and sales and marketing and R&D so far this year. Q3 operating income was $173 million or a 25% margin compared to 24% last quarter and 24% in the year ago quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $229 million in the quarter and after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $204 million for a free cash flow margin of 30%. Now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2024. First, our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent quarters and apply conservativism on these growth trends. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $709 million to $713 million, which represents a 20% to 21% year-over-year growth rate. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $163 million to $167 million, which implies an operating margin of 23%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.42 to $0.44 per share based on approximately 361 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the fully fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.656 to $2.660 billion, which represents 25% year-of-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $658 million to $662 million, which implies an operating margin of 25%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.77 per share based on approximately 359 million weighted average diluted shares. Now, finally some additional notes on guidance. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $140 million. Next, we expect cash taxes in 2024 to be in the $20 million to $25 million range and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range for fiscal 2024. Now to conclude, we are continuing to execute on our strategy, investing in our innovation and expanding our platform to deliver more value to our customers. And lastly, I want to thank all Datadog\u2019s Worldwide for their efforts as we close out 2024. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, David. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much and congrats on another very healthy performance. Olivier, we noticed your AI contributions surged to about 6% this quarter. We're watching all the advances in the foundation models, including the OpenAI\u2019s Strawberry version. We're watching the multi-step reasoning, how they're becoming multi-modal, the longer duration inference, the video models. Does it seem reasonable to you that we are on the cusp of a pretty interesting period in the next couple years for the inferencing loads and that might drive some incremental traction for Datadog that is tied to AI? Then I have a quick follow-up for David.\nOlivier Pomel: I mean, look, it's definitely a very interesting period to say the least. We see tons of innovation across the customer base, still largely more around experimenting and testing new applications. Though as we reported, we are seeing some customers moving to production and we are seeing production minded availability product, for example, being used by real paying customers, which is real volumes and real applications in real production workload. So that's exciting and healthy. I think it's a great trend for the future. In general, in terms of the workloads, you are right that we're starting to see more inference workloads, but they still tend to be more concentrated across a number of API driven providers. So there are a few others both on airlines and other kinds of models. So this is where I think most of the usage, in production at least is today. We expect that to diversify more over time as companies get further into production with applications and they start to be customizing more on their other models.\nMark Murphy: Okay, understood. And then David, to the extent -- and you've always said that revenue is a better indicator than billings and RPO. But to the extent that billings growth was affected by timing, as you mentioned we've seen that before, we know it can bounce around. But did you have some of the invoices that would have gone out in September and instead they were issued in October, in other words, would we see some recapture of the timing element in Q4 or perhaps in early next year or is it some other dynamic there?\nDavid Obstler: Yeah, it's really some other dynamic. It's that the timing of billing for last year was slightly different than for this year. And so it was more a factor of timing for billing last year that didn't repeat this year. So, we think that the weighted average, what we talked about, the average over the 12 months is a better indicator of the relationship between billing and revenues. And when you look at that, they're much more closely aligned.\nMark Murphy: Excellent. Thank you again.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSanjit Singh: Yeah, thank you for taking the questions. Olivier, in the framework that you have laid out for the business, observe, secure, and act. I wanted to focus on the last two pillars, secure and act. When we think about how the security -- cloud security sales motion has been going this quarter versus prior quarters, any trend lines there and any sort of early indications on the uptake of some of the service management products and more of the automation features within the Datadog platform?\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, so on the security side, I think we -- there's quite a bit of focus right now on the cloud scene as we see a number of very exciting opportunities there. I think, when you look at the landscape competitively with what other companies are using, because most companies have seen it already, at least for some part of their business. I think there's a very interesting opportunity for us there AND the product is mature enough to win in best of both situations across the existing products. So we are making quite a bit of a push, and we are -- we're still investing quite a bit in the rest of the platform and bringing all the products together to be a unified platform for security. But I would say the tip of the spare for this quarter next is a I think there's a very specific opportunity there. On the -- and we also have a few other product security that are coming online soon that we haven't brought to GA yet, but we think can make a big difference. In service management, we actually see very exciting trends from customers. We mentioned on the call On Call product, which puts us directly to the paging loop and the start of many incidents. The product is getting stronger reception than we initially thought to the point where customers are basically clamoring to buy even though it's still in preview. So we feel good about handling the full loop for them, starting with when we detect something in observability all the way to full incident resolution and automation is a big part of it. So we think On Call can be a bit of a watershed for us to do quite a bit more on that. So we're also excited and we're doing what we can to accelerate the roadmap there because we think there's a very good opportunity. We have a few other building blocks on the service management that we released over the past year, and they're all growing quite nicely I would say from small basis today. But we're very excited in the way they all come together to form an integrity platform where we can fully automate resolution for our customers. So that's, again, still something we're building lastly from those building blocks but something that we think is going to be very exciting in the quarter and years to come.\nSanjit Singh: That's great to hear. And so one follow up, going to sort of the spending intentions from your customers, it feels like most of the past 12 to 18 months, the sales playbook, particularly in the enterprise has been around consolidation. Is that still the theme in terms of driving new bookings, new expansion deals or are you starting to see customers focused more or less about the consolidation opportunity, more about innovation and bringing their innovation budgets to bear to invest in AI and cloud and bringing Datadog along for the ride?\nOlivier Pomel: I mean, there's always been innovation and new things. You're right that at least for the deals we talk about in the earnings, there tends to be more consolidation, but that's the nature of it. I mean, innovation typically happens gradually as opposed to being a big bang customer switching $5 billion from five vendors into another vendor. So we talk about these less in the running but that's been happening throughout. We definitely see room for a lot more consolidation moving forward both in terms of existing customers and new logos. And at the same time we are excited to see what's happening with the AI innovation as it gets further down the pipe and away from testing and experimenting and more into production applications. And we have some signs that it's starting to happen. Again, we see that with our LLM observability product. We see that also with some of the workloads we monitor from our customers on the infrastructure side. But I would say it's still very early days in terms of customers being in production with their AI, their next-gen applications.\nSanjit Singh: Great. Thank you for the thoughts, Olivier.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thank you. Congrats from me as well. Can I stay on that subject a little bit longer Olivier, if you think about the one big driver for you guys in the past was workload growth, and that's something that we are kind of all watching out for the hyperscalers as well. But it looks like there's stable trends at the hyperscalers and for you as well. Like, if you think about the puts and takes there to think that's changing, like how much of that is just plain vanilla macro and how much of that is like taking project resources away, not so much money but also time for kind of AI and it's obviously like, as you said, early in this lifecycle. Can you just -- how do you see that playing out because that's the one thing we are all watching out? Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, I mean, look, the key thing to remind everyone of is, we think the general move of workload growth in the cloud or cloud environments might be public cloud based, but they might also be private cloud. So this growth and move to the cloud is going to last for a very long time and is going to be at fairly high level for a very long time. So you are right that when we look at the numbers from the hyperscalers and when we try to factor out what's GPU driven, the growth looks stable-ish. We think that growth is still high and is going to last for a very long time and that's one of the big underpinning trends that we're going to write for in the years to come. Now on the edge of that, you are right that the -- where the workload could have grown maybe -- instead of growing 20%, they could grow 25%, maybe some of those 5% instead of being invested both in terms of a -- budget or innovation -- time innovation budget all that is going into AI. And that's largely right now in experimentation and model training and that sort of thing. That's probably that. But we see that also as a precursor to further workload growth in the future, like I would say more traditional production and application workload growth. So for us, it doesn't really change the equation. It does create a bit of a de-correlation between all numbers as a whole and the numbers you might see reported from the hyperscalers where a lot of their short term growth rides more on the capacity of GPUs they bring online for those experimentation and training workloads.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then one follow-up for David, like, if you think about capacity, like where are you in terms of sales capacity in case things are changing or how do you think about like increasing, maintaining capacity for as we think about the New Year? Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah, we think long term our revenue, our sales capacity is highly correlated with our top line growth. And as we said, we've been attempting to increase our sales capacity similar to top line growth rates. And that has to do, as we've mentioned with bottoms up planning, putting sales capacity in areas where we see either under coverage a lot of white space, and then ramping and training our sales people. So our philosophy is to scale our sales capacity roughly in line with the top line.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Alright. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: And we see plenty of opportunity for growth, and we're like -- the plan is to, to keep growing the capacity. There are many markets, many geographies where we are under penetrated. We mentioned India on the core, it is one of them where there's tremendous opportunity and we have very little presence at this point. And in general, there's a question of what we're doing strategically, where we're going and how much we want to invest, and then tactically the question of how we execute against that plan. And it's a -- that one is a lot harder, because it's easy to say, we're going to grow the sales team by 20%, 30%, 40%. It's much harder to then have these people show up in the right region at the right time and be trained and everything else. And I would say, we are doing fairly well there. We say we probably are doing better at the end of the year than we did at the beginning of the year in terms of bringing all of our growing on sales capacity for tactical reasons. But overall, we are executing towards our plan.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yep. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. And I'm curious to get your thoughts on two things, I'll keep this brief. In the subsequent few weeks after the quarter closed I'm curious, especially with rate cuts how you feel the customer feedback has been coming along, particularly on the SMB side, since the rate of change is not been discernible, at least at the end of the quarter? And one for you Olivier, as you look at GPU workloads, what about the company's existing portfolio geared towards CPU applies in a GPU world and how do you monetize an instance of GPU versus a CPU, if that word makes sense? Thank you so much.\nOlivier Pomel: I can go GPU. Yes. So look, there's two parts. There is -- what can you do for our GPU that's different from a CPU? I think in general there's quite a few things that aren\u2019t the same, in terms of understanding how that machine sits with the rest of the application or like system performance, that sort of stuff. And there's quite a bit that's new and differentiated around profiling in general and understanding how you maximize the usage of the GPU bandwidth, which is usually what it's about. I would say we're -- so right now we're working with a number of customers that are real world large inference workloads on how who we can help on the GPU profiling side for inference. We are doing less on the training side, mostly because the training jobs tend to be more bespoke and temporary and there's less of an application that's attached to those that these are just very large clusters of GPUs. So it's closer to HPC in a way than it's to traditional applications. Though we are also experimenting with what we can do there, there is a world where maybe in a durable fashion 60% of workloads are interference and 40% are training. And if that's the case, there's going to be a lot of value to be had by having repeatable training and repeatable tooling for that. So we are also looking into that. Today, as of today, we really don't monetize GPU instances all that well compared to the other CPU instances. So GPU instance is many times the cost of a CPU instance and which is obviously same amount for it. That doesn't have to be the case in the future. If we do things that are particularly interesting, it can have a real impact and deliver value and would put whole customers use and make the best of the GPU in the end save money. So, today that's the current situation.\nDavid Obstler: And as to your other question in the period since the closing of Q3, we've seen very similar trends to the year to date in Q3 in terms of customer growth, our strength in enterprise stability and SMB. And we have a strong pipeline for Q4 that we're working hard on harvesting as we get towards year-end.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for the next question. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent, your line is now open.\nBrent Thill: Hi, good morning. David on RPO, it has been decelerating. It's in focus with investors. I know you've said focus on revenue. But I think many are kind of concerned about the trajectory, and I know you've said, hey, the backlog's strong and you're adding sales capacity and all of the things that make sense but your backlog is maybe bigger than the numbers we are reporting. Can you add anymore context to what the pipeline, how you feel about the pipeline, what you think is going on with the metric in terms of the D cell was a pretty, pretty big step down?\nDavid Obstler: Yeah, I think the -- as we started talking about duration, we had a surge in these period, the period last year of longer term contracts. That was really customer led. We may well have that in the future, but in just comparing the timing of that, it doesn't affect revenues. We had that kind of compare, I would say, when you look at adjusting for duration and looking at over a long term, we do find that all of these metrics are circling around revenue, in the mid-twenties. So I think there's a lot of noise in those, and it has a lot to do with the timing particularly in RPO of multi-year deals. We'll report at the end of Q4 how that progressed. We have a lot of business to do in Q4, particularly in the larger customer and enterprise side. And we'll see where that lands, but I think it's again a best to go back towards revenues as the North Star.\nOlivier Pomel: And those really don't relate all that much to the sales pipelines because a lot of those -- I'm putting my CFO hard right now, but yeah -- which I am aware, so bear with me. Everything has to do with when customers recommit and extend their commit and for how long they extend this commit. And there's a high degree of variability there, so they might go from one year to three year. Those three years might actually run out or they might recommit after one year and a half or two years and a half or three years or maybe three years and two months, if it takes longer to figure out what level they want to be at next. And so it adds a ton of viability to the billing numbers in general. And that's why we don't look at them at all for managing the business. We look at usage and we look at the sales pipeline in terms of what new business with new workloads, with new revenue and usage are we getting from customers.\nDavid Obstler: I think what Ollie is saying is that output to the natural flow of business, which has more volatility than revenues do.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is now open.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. I've got a couple of questions about the comment David, around some of your larger AI native customers, maybe revenues from them being a little bit more volatile going forward. I guess first question is, why do you think that is -- is this just a natural phenomenon of a few of those AI native customers now becoming quite large and so it's normal that they try to look for better unit pricing and optimization, or is there something else going on? And then maybe secondly, when you set your 4Q guide, did you embed the assumption of some of these AI startup pricing and observability trends that you called out or no, you're just trying to be prudent and that might be a little bit more of a 2025 phenomenon? Thanks so much.\nOlivier Pomel: Yeah, yeah, do you want to. I can take some of that. I think the, look, what we see there is we, so we have a group of AI like smaller, relatively small number of AI companies or AI native companies. Many of them are model providers or infrastructure providers for AI that serve the rest of the industry. And that\u2019s really a proxy for the future growth of the rest of the industry in AI. That group has been growing very fast, and we mentioned it's 6% of our AR, it was about 4% of year-over-year growth in Q3 versus 2% one year ago. So it's been growing very fast. There is some revenue concentration within that group. So customers there are follow up all over in terms of revenue, like the rest of the customer base pretty much. And seeing this very fast growth what we do expect, we've seen that before, is we expect optimization at some point and in better terms, a recommit from those customers because they're all way over, or many of them are way over their last commit with us, which again goes back to the other comment on bookings like their growth doesn't show up at all in the RPOs and the bookings numbers because they're way over their commit. The analogy I would give there is what we've seen with cloud natives in the late 10s, early 20s where we had these numbers of cloud native consumer companies that were growing very fast with two differences. The first one is that the AI cohort is growing faster and there are larger individual ACVs for these customers. And the second difference is that it's a much smaller fraction of our total ARR. So at the time we had a very large number -- very large amount of our revenue that was cloud native companies and consumer companies in the late 10s and early 20s. Today, we just have 6% of our AI in that bucket. So we made that comment because we don't have anything to say in terms of where it's going. We don't -- there's nothing we see in October that tells us like there's big changes but we do think there can be volatility there. Like especially this can move the numbers in the short-term while the mid to long-term growth or the mid to long-term dominant motion we'll see is growth with that customer base. So that's why we made that comment.\nDavid Obstler: Yeah. And as to the fourth quarter I echo the comments we make. Overall, which is we take conservative assumptions relative to usage growth that are lower than we've seen in providing our guidance, of course, where we are in the year, the effect on Q4 is more limited than it would be on next year. And as we report a Q4 and give guidance, we will update everybody on any trends that we do see in this cohort at that time.\nOlivier Pomel: We didn't change guidance principles for this, like, we made an extra comment on it because we want to be transparent, we've seen that, and we see some customers are aware of their commits but we didn't -- we didn't bake anything specific in the guidance.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. That's all very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for the next question. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nKirk Materne: Yeah, thanks very much. Ollie, you mentioned the one federal customer this quarter -- a larger federal customer this quarter. Can you just talk on broader trends for you all within the federal government and sort of the opportunity there and what you're seeing, and I guess if it had any positive impact, obviously it's their fiscal year end in September, so just any comments more generally on Fed would be great? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Look, it's a huge opportunity for us and I would say, quite early with some interesting successes, so we have some exciting logo there. Like, there's this one that we mentioned this quarter, which is an agency we all interact with and which has tremendous opportunity for growth and up sale with us. There's another agency that already has a very large multimillion dollar ACV footprint with Datadog that we didn't talk about this quarter, but that's been a long term customer. So there's plenty of opportunity. We're still very early in terms of capacity building, channel building, and go to market in general in government. So I would say it's still a small part of overall business but we see that there's tons of upside in it. And we're working hard on the product side so that we can capture that fully. So, we over the past few years worked on FedRAMP compliance and we are working further on getting into more regulated even tougher to get into workloads with FedRAMP and IO 5 and other certifications like that. So we have a long roadmap there and big plans to be out and a lot of upside.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham. Mike, your line is now open.\nMike Cikos: Hey, thanks for getting me on the call here guys. I just had two quick questions for you. The first on gross margin, just wanted to get a better understanding, is there anything you can speak to as it relates to those AI native customers, the intensity of those workloads, and then how your products feed into it or maybe even the broader portfolio and the product expansion you've seen, I'm just wondering if those newer products maybe are detracting from gross margin near-term here versus some expansion that we can expect as these products scale? That's the first question. Second question was just great to hear that the usage growth continues to trend higher, especially for those existing customers. Does it feel where we sit today in this \u201cnew environment\u201d like this is par for the course kind of growth when thinking about the usage coming from those existing customers or is there a reason to believe that this can actually accelerate if things can move higher one way or another, what would drive that?\nDavid Obstler: Um, yeah, so on, on gross margins, I would, in general, we are happy with where they are and we did some small moves in it, I wouldn't read too much in the moves. I mean, there's a behind the scenes, like there's a number of things that are under that. We keep raising new functionality, at the same time we keep optimizing our code and use it, we actually use our products to optimize that quite a bit. And then we also keep getting better and better agreements with our cloud providers as we scale. So it is combination of all that is what you see in the gross margin number. We -- internally, we have to make a call always on whether we direct more effort at building new functionality or optimizing. And the way we manage that is when gross margins get a little bit low we put more effort on optimizing and when we are in a happier zone, like we redirect more effort on new products and new functionality into that. There's not a lot of change like, product mix doesn't really matter all that much on a gross margin perspective. And so there's no particular worries there. We think long term there are plenty of opportunities to improve margins, but right now the focus is on really shipping enough products to enough customers, making sure that the products get provided with as much value as possible while staying within a certain happy zone on the overall margin. In terms of the growth of workloads, look, I mean, as we said, we see growth across the customer base pretty much. We see growth of classical workloads in the cloud. We see large growth -- very large growth on the AI native side. We think that the one big catalyst for future acceleration will be those AI native applications or those AI applications, I should say, going into production for non-AI native companies for a much broader set of customers than the customers that are deploying these kind of applications to their -- in production. And as they do, they will also look less like just large cluster of GPUs and more like traditional applications because the GPU needs a database, it needs core application in front of it, it needs layers to secure it and authorize it and all the other things. So it's going to look a lot more like a normal application with some additional more concentrated compute and GPUs.\nMike Cikos: Thank you very much Ollie.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from the line of Gray Powell at BTIG. Your line is now open.\nGray Powell: Alright, great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up on Datadog on call. It was good to hear the commentary on that earlier in the call, and it has been coming up more in our field work. So I'm just curious like how should we think about the opportunity there, is that something that could completely displace a product like PagerDuty or is it more of an add-on feature since my understanding is it mainly works with the Datadog ecosystem versus other tools? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Look, we'll take it where the demand takes us. So we initially built it as a way for customers within our ecosystem to have a fully integrated experience. And really as a step stone towards full automation of incident resolution and full ownership from end-to-end. The part that strategically is the most interesting to us is the automation of the resolution, not physically aging customers. That being said, the response from customers has been so strong that there is very high demand for integrating with many different other sources and plug ourselves into incident resolution loops that we might not have been a part of before even. And so that's definitely something that we're going to build for customers, and we're just very happy to see the demand there.\nGray Powell: Understood. Alright, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks and nice numbers, guys. Ollie, a question for you. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that 15 of your 23 products are now running over $10 million. Maybe if you look at the ones that are still under $100 million or under $50 million, where do you see -- where are you most excited, which ones do you think have the highest odds of crossing the $100 million mark?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, again, I don't want to single out any products for which we didn't disclose metrics in particular. But look, we mentioned in previous calls, like there are products that are growing very fast that we think will reach the scale velocity. We see -- we talked about database monitoring, for example, was a product has been growing very fast, very clear value. And we -- I actually forgot which number we disclosed last time, but we did disclose a number for it. 1% of revenue is what we disclosed. And so this one is clearly headed for north of 50%. There's a number in the other cohort that I -- a number of products across security, user experience that I think are definitely going to get there very soon. So we feel good about all that basically. The point here is pretty much every single one of those products should be above $50 million. Some of them are going to get there faster than others. Some of them will cross $100 million. Some of them will cross $1 billion maybe. So I think we feel good about the product set.\nIttai Kidron: That's great. Maybe as a follow-up for both of you. You didn't provide 2025 guidance, of course, but are there any thoughts you want to leave us with as we think about 2025 and perhaps given where we are in the year. Ollie, your initial conversations with customers and how they think about next year, anything to point out with respect to their behavior or investment areas of focus, which perhaps are different than what they've been in 2024?\nOlivier Pomel: Look, I think the only thing I would say is, I mean, I won't get into second-guessing our guidance or things like that. And we -- in general, also, it's very hard to guess usage ahead of time because that's actually very -- it is very different or can be very different from the intents that are being manifested by customers or their understanding of what the next year is going to look like. But the one thing I will say is we're investing. We're building sales capacity. We're definitely investing heavily in engineering. I think it's a target investment in the industry. Unlike many others, we don't expect at this point to have outsized investments in compute. We're not building absolutely large GPU clusters, but we are building engineering capacity, and we are building sales capacity. And so you should expect that in the numbers we give for next year.\nIttai Kidron: Very good, appreciate it. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: David, anything to add or\u2026?\nDavid Obstler: No, I think we -- I've said that at this point, we've noted that there's been stability to upward trend in usage that many of our clients, particularly in enterprise are getting back to the work of launching digital applications, and that's creating the pipeline and the results for us. And although we still are in an environment that's careful and wants return on their investments. And we'll update everybody as to whether that's what we see. But generally, we're giving comments based on what we see in this environment, which has been good and stable.\nIttai Kidron: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back over to CEO, Olivier Pomel, for closing remarks.\nOlivier Pomel: Well, thank you all for attending the call. I want to give a few shout-outs. Firstly, for the product management team for building great products last quarter, the customers that actually spent all this time with us on getting those products to work right, especially for the new products, and I'm talking about LLM observability, for example, or On Call, and I know we spent a lot of time with customers to get those right. And I also want to give a special shout out to the go-to-market team. We have a very, very, very loaded fourth quarter, very full slate for everyone in the next, let's call it month and half. And so I know everybody is super hard at work. So thank you everyone. And on this, I think we'll wrap the call.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks Yuka and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report an -- Q3 as we continued to execute against our goals to help our customers grow faster, safer, and more efficient as the modernized application. We kept broadening our platform in observability and beyond, including in next gen AI where interest continues to rise. And we added new customers while expanding with existing ones as they grow into the cloud. Let me start with a review of our Q3 financial performance. Revenue was $690 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 29,200 customers, up from about 26,800 a year ago. We had about 3,490 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 3,130 a year ago. And these customers generated about 88% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $204 million with a free cash flow margin of 30%. Turning to platform adoption, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q3, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 82% a year ago. 49% of customers were using four or more products, up from 46% a year ago. 26% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 21% a year ago. And 12% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 8% a year ago. We continue to execute on growth across the three pillars of observability and we are pleased to report that infrastructure monitoring or APM suite and log management together, represent more than $2.5 billion in ARR. As a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, synthetics, real user monitoring, and continuous profiler. We also want to call out our newer products, which are increasingly contributing to our business. Of our 23 products, 15 now exceeded $10 million in ARR. These include even more classical product, as well as CI visibility and cloud cost management. So we have many products beginning to contribute to our revenue growth, and we're continuing to build greater capabilities within those products for our customers. Now, let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, the business environment for Datadog has remained stable, and similar to what we have seen throughout 2024. Our customers overall are growing their cloud usage, while some are continuing to be cost-conscious. In Q3, we continue to see existing customer usage growth broadly in line with our expectations. Our usage growth with existing customers continued to be higher than in the year ago quarter. And we saw healthy growth across our product lines, with newer products growing faster and more mature products of a smaller base. Finally, churn continues to be low, and growth revenue retention was stable in the mid to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers. Moving on to R&D. In the next gen AI space, customers continued to experiment with new AI technologies and as they do, they want to get visibility into their AI use. At the end of Q3, about 3,000 customers use one or more Datadog AI integrations to send us data about their AI, machine learning, and LLM usage. As some of these experiments start turning into production AI applications, we are seeing initial signs of traction for our LLM observability product. Today, hundreds of customers are using LLM observability, with more exploring it every day. And some of our first paying customers have told us that they have cut the time spent investigating LLM latency errors and quality from days of hours to just minutes. Our customers don't only want to understand the performance and cost of the LLM applications, they also want to understand LLM model performance within the context of their entire application. So they are using APM alongside LLM observability to get fully integrated end to end visibility across all the applications and text acts. Meanwhile, we continue to work to make the Datadog platform the best place for customers to monitor secure and take action on their systems, no matter where they deploy. In September, we launched Datadog monitoring for Oracle Cloud infrastructure for general availability. With this launch, our customers get visibility into their OCI stack and they can manage in real time the performance of OCI cloud services, servers, VMs, databases, containers, and apps in Datadog. And customers can now unify their monitoring across OCI, other clouds, and open environments. We also continue to expand our platform in new ways to bring value to our customers. At our Dash User Conference this summer, we announced Datadog on call our newest product in the cloud service management space. As you know, our customers use Datadog extensively during their work days for alerting and troubleshooting, whether that's for observability or security use cases. Now, with Datadog On Call, we are bringing a modern paging experience directly into our unified platform. And we know for a completely integrated solution that covers incidents from end to end, from detection, alerting, and paging, to incident management, troubleshooting, and resolution. Even though On Call is still in limited availability, we are already seeing very strong reception for the product, and we are beginning to see customers with what's on call as part of their deals. In particular, new customers are interested in including paging as part of their LAN with Datadog. So we're working hard to deepen and broaden our platform. And our innovations are rightfully being recognized by independent research firms. We are pleased to see that for the fourth year in a row, Datadog has been named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for observability platforms. We believe that this validates our approach to deliver unified platform, which breaks down silos across teams. And Datadog has also been named a leader in Gartner's very first Magic Quadrant for digital experience monitoring, which includes Datadog's products across synthetic testing, real user monitoring, product analytics, session replay, and error tracking. Now, let's move on to sales and marketing. Our sales team continue to execute this quarter, and we added some exciting new customers while expanding with many more. So let's go through a few examples. First, we'll need a seven-figure annualized deal with the leading e-commerce company in India. With its previous observatory vendor, the customers so quickly increasing costs while lacking the enterprise-grade observability they needed. By switching to Datadog, they expect to support their goals, and we'll rely for that for tracing, granular profiling, and cloud integration support. I will note that we are pleased to have landed a large new logo customer in India, and we are continuing to invest to grow our presence and our opportunities there. Next, we signed a six-figure annualized land with a major U.S. federal agency. This agency is beginning to move some of its workloads to the cloud, and is expanding the service it offers to every single U.S. citizen through cloud applications. They have chosen Datadog to observe and secure their cloud environment, and deliver a faster, better experience to end users. This deal includes eight products on Datadog cloud, including cloud seed and cloud security management. Next, we're going to need a seven-figure annualized deal with a large American financial services company. This customer has a very seasonal business, and experiences thousands of major incidents during the annual peak season, with an average downtime per incident of about five hours. And they estimate millions of dollars of lost revenue for each hour of downtime. By replacing its cloud provider's monitoring through the Datadog and in particular, using a realism monitoring product, this customer targets substantial reductions in downtime. They are starting with five Datadog products and are trailing on network monitoring, database monitoring, cloud security, and cloud cost management products, as they look to consider that dozens of homegrown commercial tools. Next, we'll need a seven-figure annualized expansion with a major airline in Europe. This customer has adopted Datadog's for its customer-facing website. They are now moving hundreds of applications from on-prem to AWS, and they want to de-risk their cloud migration. They estimate that each incident can cost tens of millions of dollars in loss-revenue and customer impact. By using Datadog across five products, this customer expects to significantly improve mean time resolution, and have already seen progress in that respect during our evaluation period with Datadog. Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a division of a hyper-scaler that will bring next-gen AI models. This customer is very technically capable, and already has a homegrown observity solution which requires time-consuming customization and manual configuration. They will be launching new features for their large language more soon, and need a platform that can scale flexibly for supporting proactive incident detection. By expanding the use of Datadog, they expect to efficiently onboard new teams in the environment and support the rapidly increasing adoption of data. Next and last, we find a seven-figure annualized expansion with a leading online food delivery company in Latin America. Before Datadog, this customer suffered from excessive alerting noise, silo teams, and lack of visibility, with each minute of downtime resulting in thousands of loss orders. By using Datadog, this customer has experienced meaningful reductions in mean-time-to-resolution and false alerts, while sitting on hard costs in the community's environment. This customer is expanding to 10 products in the Datadog platform. And that is it for another productive quarter from our go-to market team. Now let me say a few words on a longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change to the multi-year trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration, which we continue to believe are still in early days. We are seeing continued experimentation with new advances, such as next-gen AI. We believe this is one of the many factors that will drive greater use of the cloud and other modern technologies. So we are helping our customers every day to observe, secure, and act on their business critical applications and workloads. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, David. I mean, look, it's definitely a very interesting period to say the least. We see tons of innovation across the customer base, still largely more around experimenting and testing new applications. Though as we reported, we are seeing some customers moving to production and we are seeing production minded availability product, for example, being used by real paying customers, which is real volumes and real applications in real production workload. So that's exciting and healthy. I think it's a great trend for the future. In general, in terms of the workloads, you are right that we're starting to see more inference workloads, but they still tend to be more concentrated across a number of API driven providers. So there are a few others both on airlines and other kinds of models. So this is where I think most of the usage, in production at least is today. We expect that to diversify more over time as companies get further into production with applications and they start to be customizing more on their other models. Yeah, so on the security side, I think we -- there's quite a bit of focus right now on the cloud scene as we see a number of very exciting opportunities there. I think, when you look at the landscape competitively with what other companies are using, because most companies have seen it already, at least for some part of their business. I think there's a very interesting opportunity for us there AND the product is mature enough to win in best of both situations across the existing products. So we are making quite a bit of a push, and we are -- we're still investing quite a bit in the rest of the platform and bringing all the products together to be a unified platform for security. But I would say the tip of the spare for this quarter next is a I think there's a very specific opportunity there. On the -- and we also have a few other product security that are coming online soon that we haven't brought to GA yet, but we think can make a big difference. In service management, we actually see very exciting trends from customers. We mentioned on the call On Call product, which puts us directly to the paging loop and the start of many incidents. The product is getting stronger reception than we initially thought to the point where customers are basically clamoring to buy even though it's still in preview. So we feel good about handling the full loop for them, starting with when we detect something in observability all the way to full incident resolution and automation is a big part of it. So we think On Call can be a bit of a watershed for us to do quite a bit more on that. So we're also excited and we're doing what we can to accelerate the roadmap there because we think there's a very good opportunity. We have a few other building blocks on the service management that we released over the past year, and they're all growing quite nicely I would say from small basis today. But we're very excited in the way they all come together to form an integrity platform where we can fully automate resolution for our customers. So that's, again, still something we're building lastly from those building blocks but something that we think is going to be very exciting in the quarter and years to come. I mean, there's always been innovation and new things. You're right that at least for the deals we talk about in the earnings, there tends to be more consolidation, but that's the nature of it. I mean, innovation typically happens gradually as opposed to being a big bang customer switching $5 billion from five vendors into another vendor. So we talk about these less in the running but that's been happening throughout. We definitely see room for a lot more consolidation moving forward both in terms of existing customers and new logos. And at the same time we are excited to see what's happening with the AI innovation as it gets further down the pipe and away from testing and experimenting and more into production applications. And we have some signs that it's starting to happen. Again, we see that with our LLM observability product. We see that also with some of the workloads we monitor from our customers on the infrastructure side. But I would say it's still very early days in terms of customers being in production with their AI, their next-gen applications. Yeah, I mean, look, the key thing to remind everyone of is, we think the general move of workload growth in the cloud or cloud environments might be public cloud based, but they might also be private cloud. So this growth and move to the cloud is going to last for a very long time and is going to be at fairly high level for a very long time. So you are right that when we look at the numbers from the hyperscalers and when we try to factor out what's GPU driven, the growth looks stable-ish. We think that growth is still high and is going to last for a very long time and that's one of the big underpinning trends that we're going to write for in the years to come. Now on the edge of that, you are right that the -- where the workload could have grown maybe -- instead of growing 20%, they could grow 25%, maybe some of those 5% instead of being invested both in terms of a -- budget or innovation -- time innovation budget all that is going into AI. And that's largely right now in experimentation and model training and that sort of thing. That's probably that. But we see that also as a precursor to further workload growth in the future, like I would say more traditional production and application workload growth. So for us, it doesn't really change the equation. It does create a bit of a de-correlation between all numbers as a whole and the numbers you might see reported from the hyperscalers where a lot of their short term growth rides more on the capacity of GPUs they bring online for those experimentation and training workloads. And we see plenty of opportunity for growth, and we're like -- the plan is to, to keep growing the capacity. There are many markets, many geographies where we are under penetrated. We mentioned India on the core, it is one of them where there's tremendous opportunity and we have very little presence at this point. And in general, there's a question of what we're doing strategically, where we're going and how much we want to invest, and then tactically the question of how we execute against that plan. And it's a -- that one is a lot harder, because it's easy to say, we're going to grow the sales team by 20%, 30%, 40%. It's much harder to then have these people show up in the right region at the right time and be trained and everything else. And I would say, we are doing fairly well there. We say we probably are doing better at the end of the year than we did at the beginning of the year in terms of bringing all of our growing on sales capacity for tactical reasons. But overall, we are executing towards our plan. I can go GPU. Yes. So look, there's two parts. There is -- what can you do for our GPU that's different from a CPU? I think in general there's quite a few things that aren't the same, in terms of understanding how that machine sits with the rest of the application or like system performance, that sort of stuff. And there's quite a bit that's new and differentiated around profiling in general and understanding how you maximize the usage of the GPU bandwidth, which is usually what it's about. I would say we're -- so right now we're working with a number of customers that are real world large inference workloads on how who we can help on the GPU profiling side for inference. We are doing less on the training side, mostly because the training jobs tend to be more bespoke and temporary and there's less of an application that's attached to those that these are just very large clusters of GPUs. So it's closer to HPC in a way than it's to traditional applications. Though we are also experimenting with what we can do there, there is a world where maybe in a durable fashion 60% of workloads are interference and 40% are training. And if that's the case, there's going to be a lot of value to be had by having repeatable training and repeatable tooling for that. So we are also looking into that. Today, as of today, we really don't monetize GPU instances all that well compared to the other CPU instances. So GPU instance is many times the cost of a CPU instance and which is obviously same amount for it. That doesn't have to be the case in the future. If we do things that are particularly interesting, it can have a real impact and deliver value and would put whole customers use and make the best of the GPU in the end save money. So, today that's the current situation. And those really don't relate all that much to the sales pipelines because a lot of those -- I'm putting my CFO hard right now, but yeah -- which I am aware, so bear with me. Everything has to do with when customers recommit and extend their commit and for how long they extend this commit. And there's a high degree of variability there, so they might go from one year to three year. Those three years might actually run out or they might recommit after one year and a half or two years and a half or three years or maybe three years and two months, if it takes longer to figure out what level they want to be at next. And so it adds a ton of viability to the billing numbers in general. And that's why we don't look at them at all for managing the business. We look at usage and we look at the sales pipeline in terms of what new business with new workloads, with new revenue and usage are we getting from customers. Yeah, yeah, do you want to. I can take some of that. I think the, look, what we see there is we, so we have a group of AI like smaller, relatively small number of AI companies or AI native companies. Many of them are model providers or infrastructure providers for AI that serve the rest of the industry. And that's really a proxy for the future growth of the rest of the industry in AI. That group has been growing very fast, and we mentioned it's 6% of our AR, it was about 4% of year-over-year growth in Q3 versus 2% one year ago. So it's been growing very fast. There is some revenue concentration within that group. So customers there are follow up all over in terms of revenue, like the rest of the customer base pretty much. And seeing this very fast growth what we do expect, we've seen that before, is we expect optimization at some point and in better terms, a recommit from those customers because they're all way over, or many of them are way over their last commit with us, which again goes back to the other comment on bookings like their growth doesn't show up at all in the RPOs and the bookings numbers because they're way over their commit. The analogy I would give there is what we've seen with cloud natives in the late 10s, early 20s where we had these numbers of cloud native consumer companies that were growing very fast with two differences. The first one is that the AI cohort is growing faster and there are larger individual ACVs for these customers. And the second difference is that it's a much smaller fraction of our total ARR. So at the time we had a very large number -- very large amount of our revenue that was cloud native companies and consumer companies in the late 10s and early 20s. Today, we just have 6% of our AI in that bucket. So we made that comment because we don't have anything to say in terms of where it's going. We don't -- there's nothing we see in October that tells us like there's big changes but we do think there can be volatility there. Like especially this can move the numbers in the short-term while the mid to long-term growth or the mid to long-term dominant motion we'll see is growth with that customer base. So that's why we made that comment. We didn't change guidance principles for this, like, we made an extra comment on it because we want to be transparent, we've seen that, and we see some customers are aware of their commits but we didn't -- we didn't bake anything specific in the guidance. Look, it's a huge opportunity for us and I would say, quite early with some interesting successes, so we have some exciting logo there. Like, there's this one that we mentioned this quarter, which is an agency we all interact with and which has tremendous opportunity for growth and up sale with us. There's another agency that already has a very large multimillion dollar ACV footprint with Datadog that we didn't talk about this quarter, but that's been a long term customer. So there's plenty of opportunity. We're still very early in terms of capacity building, channel building, and go to market in general in government. So I would say it's still a small part of overall business but we see that there's tons of upside in it. And we're working hard on the product side so that we can capture that fully. So, we over the past few years worked on FedRAMP compliance and we are working further on getting into more regulated even tougher to get into workloads with FedRAMP and IO 5 and other certifications like that. So we have a long roadmap there and big plans to be out and a lot of upside. Look, we'll take it where the demand takes us. So we initially built it as a way for customers within our ecosystem to have a fully integrated experience. And really as a step stone towards full automation of incident resolution and full ownership from end-to-end. The part that strategically is the most interesting to us is the automation of the resolution, not physically aging customers. That being said, the response from customers has been so strong that there is very high demand for integrating with many different other sources and plug ourselves into incident resolution loops that we might not have been a part of before even. And so that's definitely something that we're going to build for customers, and we're just very happy to see the demand there. Well, again, I don't want to single out any products for which we didn't disclose metrics in particular. But look, we mentioned in previous calls, like there are products that are growing very fast that we think will reach the scale velocity. We see -- we talked about database monitoring, for example, was a product has been growing very fast, very clear value. And we -- I actually forgot which number we disclosed last time, but we did disclose a number for it. 1% of revenue is what we disclosed. And so this one is clearly headed for north of 50%. There's a number in the other cohort that I -- a number of products across security, user experience that I think are definitely going to get there very soon. So we feel good about all that basically. The point here is pretty much every single one of those products should be above $50 million. Some of them are going to get there faster than others. Some of them will cross $100 million. Some of them will cross $1 billion maybe. So I think we feel good about the product set. Look, I think the only thing I would say is, I mean, I won't get into second-guessing our guidance or things like that. And we -- in general, also, it's very hard to guess usage ahead of time because that's actually very -- it is very different or can be very different from the intents that are being manifested by customers or their understanding of what the next year is going to look like. But the one thing I will say is we're investing. We're building sales capacity. We're definitely investing heavily in engineering. I think it's a target investment in the industry. Unlike many others, we don't expect at this point to have outsized investments in compute. We're not building absolutely large GPU clusters, but we are building engineering capacity, and we are building sales capacity. And so you should expect that in the numbers we give for next year. David, anything to add or...? Well, thank you all for attending the call. I want to give a few shout-outs. Firstly, for the product management team for building great products last quarter, the customers that actually spent all this time with us on getting those products to work right, especially for the new products, and I'm talking about LLM observability, for example, or On Call, and I know we spent a lot of time with customers to get those right. And I also want to give a special shout out to the go-to-market team. We have a very, very, very loaded fourth quarter, very full slate for everyone in the next, let's call it month and half. And so I know everybody is super hard at work. So thank you everyone. And on this, I think we'll wrap the call."

            "name": "David Obstler",
            "content": "Thanks Olivier and good morning. Q3 revenue was $690 million, up 26% year-over-year, and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of our Q3 revenue growth, overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing customers that were consistent with our expectation. We've seen conditions remain roughly stable throughout 2024, with continued movement to cloud and modern DevOps technologies, and with customers remaining cost-conscious and seeking efficiency and value from their spend. In Q3, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than usage growth in the year ago quarter, as well as higher than usage growth in the prior quarter. Now, some of our growth is coming from AI native customers, who this quarter represented more than 6% of our Q3 ARR, up from more than 4% in Q2 and about 2.5% of our ARR in the year-ago quarter. AI native customers contributed about 4 percentage points of year-over-year growth in Q3 versus about 2 percentage points in the year-ago quarter. While we believe that adoption of AI will continue to benefit Datadog in the long term, we are mindful that some of the large customers in this cohort have ramped extremely rapidly, and that these customers may optimize cloud and observability usage and increase their commitments to us over time with better terms. This may create volatility in our revenue growth in future quarters on the backdrop of long-term volume growth. Now, regarding usage growth by customer size in Q3, similar to the last quarter, we saw the strongest performance among our largest customers who spent multiple millions of dollars with us annually. And as we looked at usage growth by segment, similar to recent quarters, we are seeing the strongest growth from our enterprise customers, where year-over-year growth in usage has accelerated over the past several quarters. Meanwhile, our SMB customers remain solid, with year-over-year growth similar to the past several quarters. As a reminder, we define enterprise customers as our clients with 5,000 employees or more, mid-market customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees, and SMB customers as those companies with less than 1,000 employees. Regarding our retention metrics, our net revenue retention percentage was in the mid-110s in Q3, with continued improvement from last quarter. This is a trailing 12-month measure. Meanwhile, we have continued to see an increase in recent quarters as we look at the NRR quarterly trend. And finally, our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remains stable in the mid-to-high 90s. Now moving on to our financial results. First, buildings were $689 million, up 14% year-over-year. Billings duration decreased slightly year-over-year. Pro forma for changes in billing timing and the slight change in duration, billings growth would have been in the mid-20% range. Our billings and billings growth can be volatile on a quarterly basis depending on the timing of our deals. Our 12-month trailing billing growth is similar to our trailing 12-month revenue growth with both in the mid-20%. Remaining performance obligations or RPO was $1.82 billion up 26% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the high 20% year-over-year. RPO duration was down slightly year-over-year. Normalizing for duration, RPO growth would have been in the high 30% year-over-year. We continue to believe that revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billing an RPO as those fluctuate on a quarterly basis relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $560 million, representing a gross margin of 81.1%. This compares to a gross margin of 82.1% last quarter and 82.3% in the year ago quarter. Our Q3 OPEX grew 21% year-over-year, the same growth as last quarter, although it would have represented an acceleration from last quarter, excluding the impact of our Dash user conference in Q2. As we have said before, we are investing in headcount in 2024 and the acceleration and OPEX reflects our execution on our hiring and sales and marketing and R&D so far this year. Q3 operating income was $173 million or a 25% margin compared to 24% last quarter and 24% in the year ago quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $229 million in the quarter and after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $204 million for a free cash flow margin of 30%. Now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2024. First, our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent quarters and apply conservativism on these growth trends. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $709 million to $713 million, which represents a 20% to 21% year-over-year growth rate. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $163 million to $167 million, which implies an operating margin of 23%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.42 to $0.44 per share based on approximately 361 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the fully fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.656 to $2.660 billion, which represents 25% year-of-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $658 million to $662 million, which implies an operating margin of 25%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.77 per share based on approximately 359 million weighted average diluted shares. Now, finally some additional notes on guidance. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $140 million. Next, we expect cash taxes in 2024 to be in the $20 million to $25 million range and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range for fiscal 2024. Now to conclude, we are continuing to execute on our strategy, investing in our innovation and expanding our platform to deliver more value to our customers. And lastly, I want to thank all Datadog's Worldwide for their efforts as we close out 2024. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yeah, it's really some other dynamic. It's that the timing of billing for last year was slightly different than for this year. And so it was more a factor of timing for billing last year that didn't repeat this year. So, we think that the weighted average, what we talked about, the average over the 12 months is a better indicator of the relationship between billing and revenues. And when you look at that, they're much more closely aligned. Yeah, we think long term our revenue, our sales capacity is highly correlated with our top line growth. And as we said, we've been attempting to increase our sales capacity similar to top line growth rates. And that has to do, as we've mentioned with bottoms up planning, putting sales capacity in areas where we see either under coverage a lot of white space, and then ramping and training our sales people. So our philosophy is to scale our sales capacity roughly in line with the top line. And as to your other question in the period since the closing of Q3, we've seen very similar trends to the year to date in Q3 in terms of customer growth, our strength in enterprise stability and SMB. And we have a strong pipeline for Q4 that we're working hard on harvesting as we get towards year-end. Yeah, I think the -- as we started talking about duration, we had a surge in these period, the period last year of longer term contracts. That was really customer led. We may well have that in the future, but in just comparing the timing of that, it doesn't affect revenues. We had that kind of compare, I would say, when you look at adjusting for duration and looking at over a long term, we do find that all of these metrics are circling around revenue, in the mid-twenties. So I think there's a lot of noise in those, and it has a lot to do with the timing particularly in RPO of multi-year deals. We'll report at the end of Q4 how that progressed. We have a lot of business to do in Q4, particularly in the larger customer and enterprise side. And we'll see where that lands, but I think it's again a best to go back towards revenues as the North Star. I think what Ollie is saying is that output to the natural flow of business, which has more volatility than revenues do. Yeah. And as to the fourth quarter I echo the comments we make. Overall, which is we take conservative assumptions relative to usage growth that are lower than we've seen in providing our guidance, of course, where we are in the year, the effect on Q4 is more limited than it would be on next year. And as we report a Q4 and give guidance, we will update everybody on any trends that we do see in this cohort at that time. Um, yeah, so on, on gross margins, I would, in general, we are happy with where they are and we did some small moves in it, I wouldn't read too much in the moves. I mean, there's a behind the scenes, like there's a number of things that are under that. We keep raising new functionality, at the same time we keep optimizing our code and use it, we actually use our products to optimize that quite a bit. And then we also keep getting better and better agreements with our cloud providers as we scale. So it is combination of all that is what you see in the gross margin number. We -- internally, we have to make a call always on whether we direct more effort at building new functionality or optimizing. And the way we manage that is when gross margins get a little bit low we put more effort on optimizing and when we are in a happier zone, like we redirect more effort on new products and new functionality into that. There's not a lot of change like, product mix doesn't really matter all that much on a gross margin perspective. And so there's no particular worries there. We think long term there are plenty of opportunities to improve margins, but right now the focus is on really shipping enough products to enough customers, making sure that the products get provided with as much value as possible while staying within a certain happy zone on the overall margin. In terms of the growth of workloads, look, I mean, as we said, we see growth across the customer base pretty much. We see growth of classical workloads in the cloud. We see large growth -- very large growth on the AI native side. We think that the one big catalyst for future acceleration will be those AI native applications or those AI applications, I should say, going into production for non-AI native companies for a much broader set of customers than the customers that are deploying these kind of applications to their -- in production. And as they do, they will also look less like just large cluster of GPUs and more like traditional applications because the GPU needs a database, it needs core application in front of it, it needs layers to secure it and authorize it and all the other things. So it's going to look a lot more like a normal application with some additional more concentrated compute and GPUs. No, I think we -- I've said that at this point, we've noted that there's been stability to upward trend in usage that many of our clients, particularly in enterprise are getting back to the work of launching digital applications, and that's creating the pipeline and the results for us. And although we still are in an environment that's careful and wants return on their investments. And we'll update everybody as to whether that's what we see. But generally, we're giving comments based on what we see in this environment, which has been good and stable."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Pomel: Thanks Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a very productive second quarter. First, we welcomed thousands of Datadog users to our DASH conference in June, where we announced a broad range of exciting new products and new features for customers to observe, secure and act in their cloud environment, and we continued to add new customers and help existing ones as they grow in the cloud. Let me start with a review of our Q2 financial performance. Revenue was $645 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 28,700 customers, up from about 26,100 a year ago. We had about 3,390 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,990 last year, and these customers generated about 87% of our ARR, and we generated free cash flow of $144 million with a free cash flow margin of 22%. Turning to platform adoption, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 82% a year ago. Forty-nine percent of customers were using four or more products, up from 45% a year ago. Twenty-five percent of our customers were using six or more products, up from 21% a year ago, and 11% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 7% a year ago. We continue to expand the capabilities of all of our products over time, enabling our customers to solve more of their critical challenges. These include our efforts in digital experience monitoring, an area of observability which includes synthetics and real user monitoring, or ROM, and both synthetics and ROM are seeing growing adoption and each product today represents more than $100 million in ARR, becoming our fourth and fifth products to achieve that milestone. We have also been innovating rapidly in this area with recent capabilities including mobile app testing, feature flag testing, user journey visualization, and retention analysis, and with our recent announcement of [indiscernible] at DASH, we are excited to go further and allow our customers to consolidate of their usage and business insights into Datadog. Now let\u2019s discuss this quarter\u2019s business drivers. Overall, the business environment for Datadog was roughly unchanged from last quarter. More customers overall are growing their cloud usage, while some are continuing to be cost conscious. In Q2, we saw existing customer usage growth that was broadly in line with our expectations and consistent with the overall improved trend that we had experienced over the past several quarters. Our usage growth with existing customers was higher than in the year ago quarter, and we saw continued healthy growth across our product line with newer products growing faster from a smaller base. Finally, churn continues to be low and gross revenue retention was stable in the mid to high 90s, highlighting the mission critical nature of our platform for our customers. Moving onto R&D, we held our DASH user conference in late June and were excited to announce many new products and features for our users. There\u2019s too much for us to cover in detail, but let me review just some of the announcements we made in the past three months. In the next-gen AI space, we announced the general availability of LLM Observability, which allows application developers and machine learning engineers to efficiently monitor, troubleshoot and secure LLM applications. With LLM Observability, companies can accelerate the development of AI applications into production environments and reliably operate and scale them. We also expanded Bits AI with new capabilities. As a reminder, Bits AI is a Datadog built-in AI copilot. In addition to being able to summarize incidents and answer questions, we previewed at DASH the ability for Bits AI to operate as an agent and perform autonomous investigations. With this capability, Bits AI proactively surfaces key information and performs complex tasks such as investigating alerts and coordinating incident response. Taking a step back and looking at our customer base, we continue to see a lot of excitement around AI technology. More customers are telling us that they are levering up on AI and ramping up experimentation with the goal of delivering additional business value with AI, and we can see them doing this. Today about 2,500 customers use one or more of our AI integrations to get visibility into their increasing use of AI. We also continue to grow our business with AI-native customers, which increased to over 4% of our ARR in June. We see this as a sign of the continuing expansion of this ecosystem and of the value of using Datadog to monitor the production environment. I will note that over time, we think these metrics will become less relevant as AI usage and production broadens beyond this group of customers. Last but not least, we announced Toto, our first foundation model for time series forecasting, which delivers state-of-the-art performance on all relevant benchmarks. In addition to the technical innovations devised by our resource team, Toto derives its record performance from the quality of our training datasets and points to our unique ability to train, build and incorporate AI models into a platform that will meaningfully improve operations for our customers. Moving on from AI, we had a lot more to show in Observability. We announced the general availability of Flex Logs, which expands our Logging without Limits approach and allows our customers to scale storage and compute separately for cost efficiency. Our customers can today use our new Log Workspace for log analysis. Log Workspace is an advanced analytic feature that allows users to connect datasets, build and visualize complex queries, and create readable, [indiscernible] views and reports. It is particularly relevant to customers who previously built sophisticated analysis and workflows in legacy log management tools. We announced the general availability of Data Jobs Monitoring, which allows data engineers to detect and fix issues with their Spark and Databricks workloads and to optimize the cost and performance of their data jobs. Moving and transforming large amounts of data has grown importance and become a mission critical capability for many businesses, a trend that we believe will continue with the adoption of AI. With this, our data observability set of products is expanding. Data jobs monitoring works alongside our data streams monitoring product, which helps customers understand their queueing pipeline in moving components such as Kafka or RabbitMQ, and we\u2019re increasingly providing visibility for data lakes and data warehouses such as Snowflake to deliver end-to-end data observability across customer data resources. Moving on from data observability, we introduced Kubernetes Autoscaling to all our customers to optimize forecast and performance while automatically right-sizing Kubernetes resources. For our customers using OpenTelemetry, the Datadog agent will embed a fully configurable OpenTelemetry collector, giving [indiscernible] customers access to Datadog products such as container, network and universal service monitoring, and offering our customers what we believe will be the best fully managed OpenTelemetry experience in the market. In shifting left, our new live debugger enables developers to step through code directly in production environments and find the exact root cause of production errors. As I mentioned earlier, we are building up on our success in digital experience monitoring and [indiscernible] providing in-depth product and user insights for product managers and business owners. In the cloud security space, we launched a new application security capability called Code Security, which allows our customers to detect and prioritize code-level vulnerability in their products and applications. We also announced Data Security, which allows our customers to automatically pinpoint sensitive data, starting in [indiscernible] today and expanding to other environments in the future. For instances where customers can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to deploy agents, our new agent-less scanning capability provides visibility into risks and vulnerabilities within hosts\u2019 containers and [indiscernible] functions without requiring agents to be installed. Finally in the cloud service management space, we\u2019re going further to allow our customers to take actions directly within Datadog\u2019s platform. We announced the general availability of App Builder, which lets teams rapidly create self-service local applications and integrate them securely into their monitoring stacks, and we introduced Datadog On Call, a modern on-call experience with paging and internet management workflows fully integrated with observability. Let\u2019s move on now to sales and marketing. We again saw strong execution from our go-to-market teams this quarter and we added some exciting new customers while expanding with many more, so let\u2019s go through a few examples. First, we landed our largest ever new logo win, a multi-year deal with total contract value in the tens of millions of dollars, with one of the largest banks in South America. This customer was using a commercial observability product as well as open source tools but didn\u2019t have full stack visibility. With Datadog, they will enable end-to-end observability and they expect to transition to modern infrastructure with confidence. They also anticipate better management and predictability of their observability costs thanks to products such as Flex Log. Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized land deal with one of the world\u2019s largest travel management companies. This company was using a commercial log management tool but found it expensive and complex to support. They also worried about stability as the tool would crash and cause fire drills across the organization. By moving to Datadog and replacing this tool, they expect to drive significant savings with log management and will benefit from a unified platform across infrastructure monitoring and APM. Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized land with a security software company. This customer felt they were overspending on their commercial logging tool and lack of visibility led to issues catching incidents, with users notifying them first of outages. This customer is now adopting the Datadog unified platform across all three pillars and displacing one commercial and two open source tools in the process. This customer also expects net savings of half a million dollars every year by switching to Datadog. Next, we signed a seven-figure annual expansion with a leading central bank in Europe. This institution became a Datadog customer three years ago to enable its ambitious plan to move half of its applications to the cloud over a couple of years, and they have been increasing their usage of Datadog as they moved into the cloud, displacing two commercial observability tools which they used in their on-premise environment. They have now adopted a total of 17 Datadog products. Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a large American insurance company. This company had been using Datadog for full stack observability at one business unit. With this expansion, they have chosen Datadog as their enterprise-wide observability provider. In comparing us to the performance of other tools, this customer measured strong [indiscernible] adoption and fewer incidents with Datadog, and in displacing its legacy ATM and log management, they expect to save over $1 million annually on tool costs alone. Finally, we signed a high seven-figure annualized expansion with a leading online gambling and entertainment platform. This long-time customer uses Datadog as its strategic observability partner, enabling full visibility across infrastructure applications, logs, network, and their public [indiscernible] with users spanning from hands on keyboard engineers all the way to their [indiscernible]. This renewal supports this customer\u2019s expansion into new use cases through our security embedded into their operations by using all of our cloud security products, to build a culture of cost accountability with cloud cost management, and to take action using incident management and workflow automation. This customer to date has adopted 19 products in the Datadog platform. That\u2019s it for another productive quarter for our go-to-market teams. Now let me say a few words on our longer term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change to the multi-year trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We are seeing continued experimentation with new technologies, including next-gen AI, and we believe this is just one of the many factors that will drive greater use of the cloud and next-gen infrastructure. As indicated by our many announcements at our DASH user conference, we are delivering rapid innovation at scale and we are helping our customers every day to deploy and scale the modern environment with confidence across observability, digital experience, cloud security, cloud service management, software delivery, and product analytics. Finally, I\u2019d like to welcome two new leaders to our team. Yanbing Li is joining us as our Chief Product Officer. Yanbing has more than 25 years of product, technology and engineering experience spanning enterprise software, cloud infrastructure and AI at companies such as VMware, Google and Aurora. She will lead our product team\u2019s efforts to expand the Datadog platform. David Galloreese is joining us as our Chief People Officer. David has more than 20 years of HR experience at tech companies and large scale high visibility enterprises such as Figma, Wells Fargo, and Wal-Mart. He will help us drive the next chapter of growth and scale at Datadog. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?\nDavid Obstler: Thanks Olivier, and good morning to all. Q2 revenues were $645 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q2 revenue growth, first regarding usage growth from existing customers, the overall trend we saw was consistent with our expectations. In Q2, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than usage growth in the year-ago quarter, and as we look across the first half of 2024, our usage growth was higher than the first half of 2023. We are seeing solid growth across our products. Our three pillar products continue to increase in customer penetration and usage, and our newer products across observability, cloud security and cloud service management are ramping. Regarding usage growth by customer size in Q2, we saw strong performance amongst our largest customers, who spend multiple millions of dollars with us annually as they continue to return to growth and strike a balance between new deployment and focus on optimization. As we look at usage growth by segment, we saw the strongest growth with our enterprise customers, where year-over-year growth in usage has accelerated over the past several quarters. Over the same period, we have seen more steady year-over-year growth trends amongst our SMB and midmarket customers. As a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with 5,000 employees or more, midmarket as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees, and SMB as customers with less than 1,000 employees. Regarding our retention metrics, our net revenue retention percentage was in the mid 110s in Q2, similar to the past couple quarters; but remember, this is a trailing 12-month measure and we\u2019ve seen an increase in recent quarters as we look at the NRR quarterly trend. Finally, our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remained stable in the mid to high 90s. Now moving onto our financial results, billings were $667 million, up 28% year-over-year and similar to the trailing 12 months billing year-over-year growth. Billings duration was roughly flat versus a year ago. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO was $1.79 billion, up 43% year-over-year. As we\u2019ve said before, contract duration has generally been increasing as customers choose more multi-year deals, and contract duration increased modestly in the year-over-year period relative to a year ago. Current RPO growth was in the mid-30% year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO, as those can fluctuate on a quarterly basis relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let\u2019s review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $530 million, representing a gross margin of 82.1%. This compares to a gross margin of 83.3% in the last quarter and 81.3% in the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 opex grew 21% year-over-year and increased from 14% year-over-year growth last quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, Q2 opex included $11 million in expenses related to our DASH user conference, and as we\u2019ve discussed, we are investing in headcount in 2024 and the growth in opex reflects our execution on hiring in sales and marketing and R&D so far this year. Q2 operating income was $158 million, or 24% operating margin compared to 27% last quarter and 21% in the year-ago quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $164 million in the quarter, and after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $144 million for free cash flow margin of 22%. Now for our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2024, first our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $660 million to $664 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $146 million to $150 million, which implies an operating margin of 22% to 23%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.38 to $0.40 per share based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.63 billion, which represents 23% to 24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $620 million to $630 million, which implies an operating margin of 24%, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.66 per share, based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Some additional notes to our guidance, we expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $125 million. Next, we expect to pay cash taxes in the range of $20 million to $25 million, and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenues range in fiscal 2024. Now to conclude, as Oli mentioned, we are pleased with our execution in the first half of 2024 and plan to continue to help our customers observe, secure and act in their modern cloud environments. I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in this. With that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nSanjit Singh: Yes, thank you for taking the questions and congrats on Q2. I wanted to get your assessment of the demand environment, the spend environment, and your description of how the usage trends played out by end market and in-market versus enterprise was super helpful. Microsoft had noted that they saw some weaker usage trends in June. I just want to get a sense of if you look across your geographies, or even across some of your key verticals, anything that stood out sort of positive or negative in June going into July in terms of the usage trends?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, thanks Sanjit, and hello. Again, as I think you\u2019ve noted, we\u2019ve said that we experienced strength in our enterprise segment and stability in our SMB segment, and that continued throughout the quarter. As far as the more recent trends for what we\u2019re seeing towards the end of the quarter and also in July, very similar trends to what we saw in Q2 and for the first half of the year, so a continuation of higher usage growth than we saw in the comparable periods in the previous year.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. Then Oli, maybe for you, I know at the investor day, you sort of outlined the thoughts and strategy on M&A and identified the criteria. It sounds like your corp-dev team sees a lot of opportunity but the bar was pretty high, was the message from investor day a couple of months ago. I wanted to double-check your latest thinking on the M&A strategy with respect to potentially being--looking at more strategic or transformational, larger size deals. Has anything changed in the way you view M&A as part of the Datadog growth strategy?\nOlivier Pomel: No, there\u2019s no change to the way we see things. Because we have this [indiscernible] strategy where we\u2019re building a consolidator and we\u2019re bringing together many different use cases into one shared platform, we have very broad interest and a very ambitious road map in many different directions, so as a result, we cast a very wide net when it comes to M&A. There are many possible potential fits for us. Historically we\u2019ve been very successful with doing a lot of small and medium-sized deals. At any point in time, we are going to look at a lot of deals that might be small or big. We expect the bigger deals to be fewer and far between as the bar is very high for those, and today we\u2019re also not looking into anything that would be very material to the business.\nSanjit Singh: Understood, thank you Oli.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment as we move onto our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect, thank you. Has there been any impact, or what are you seeing in terms of a reaction from customers around the Cloudstrike outage, because that\u2019s obviously an event that impacted the whole industry. You guys, I\u2019m sure, saw some of the ramifications there. Just talk a little bit about how that impacted you in the quarter, but also what it means to customer conversations. Thank you.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, so obviously this is something that was very much in the news, was very visible. It was particularly visible because it affected devices, airport kiosks basically and point of sale, that are in the field in front of consumers, and it was pretty much everywhere at once, so very visible incident. That being said, in the grand scheme of observability, it\u2019s very unremarkable, so the Crowdstrike isn\u2019t very visible to everyone, everywhere, but every single day there\u2019s a hundred or a thousand companies that are having their Crowdstrike moment because they have outdated software--you know, third party software [indiscernible] they have built and that caused large business disruptions [indiscernible] and that\u2019s what we deal with pretty much all the time. What you see in the public eye is really a reflection of the value we provide every single day to our customers when it comes to preventing these issues, and whenever those issues happen, to remediate them extremely quickly. Of course, we had all of the interactions you can imagine with our customers around--you know, in terms of how to use our product to come back online, debug and everything, given the fix in that case was very, very manual - there was really no good way to automate it. But again, we see that every single day, that\u2019s what we do.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Then maybe it was just me, but it did feel like you mentioned logs quite a bit on this earnings call. Do you see any change--like, your product is getting more mature and the innovation that is coming through is obviously very visible, but do you see a change in the market with recent movements in terms of vendors, that that kind of opens up a little bit more from your perspective? Thank you, and congrats from me as well.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, we definitely think there is going to be more opportunity in the future, which is why we\u2019re investing heavily both in terms of making large [indiscernible] to scale, that\u2019s Flex Logs in particular, and also going further in terms of the sophistication of the functionality we can offer to customers so they can build very complex processes around those. We talked about log workspace also in the call, log workspace is particularly interesting for customers who have used other platforms and have built pipelines basically that must process a lot of logs data, and so we build that for them and that\u2019s been very well received so far. All of that is in service of going after these opportunities.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much, and I\u2019ll add my congrats. Olivier, it\u2019s great to see the announcement of LLM Observability reaching GA. I think we\u2019re all looking at this tremendous wave of hyperscaler commitments that are going to be ramping in the second half of this year, and it\u2019s all for training of these next-gen AI models. Since you\u2019re more exposed to the--excuse me, since you\u2019re less exposed to that training and you\u2019re more driven by the inferencing, I\u2019m wondering if you can just help us understand how the spending pattern or activity changes as the AI models go live and reach the inferencing stage. I\u2019m basically looking for any way to assess how much spending is ultimately going to develop into the inferencing, where you have an opportunity.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, look - as you know, it\u2019s still early. We do see customers that are moving increasingly into production, and we have a few of those. We named a couple as early customers of LLM Observability - I think the two we named were WHOOP, the fitness band, and AppFolio. We see many more that are lining up and that are going to do that, but in the grand scheme of things, looking at the whole market, it\u2019s still very early. I would say the best proxy you can get from the future demand there is the growth of the model providers and the AI natives, because they tend to be the ones that currently are being used to provide AI functionality into other applications, and largely in production environments, and so what we said there, the harbinger of what\u2019s to come.\nMark Murphy: Okay, and then as a quick follow-up, maybe for David, a couple of the consumption model software companies had recently commented that in June and July, they were seeing more cloud cost control or optimization, specifically among the digital natives, and so your results are solid. I don\u2019t think you mentioned that, but could you just comment on how the optimization activity is trending now between the digital natives and the enterprises heading into the back half?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, as you know, we\u2019ve said that--so when you look at the time series, the peak of the optimization was in Q2, Q3 last year, and we\u2019ve had a time series of higher usage growth for our clients month to month since then, and that\u2019s continued through the first half of the year and into July. The usage growth, as we talked about, is stronger in the enterprise and in the larger users, but it has been fairly stable in the SMB, so we\u2019re seeing some more--when you look at the chart and the line, enterprise usage growth being higher than it had been and SMB being stable.\nOlivier Pomel: For us, I will add that the digital natives are largely SMB and midmarket, they\u2019re not enterprise. Even when you look at the digital natives, there is two stories depending on whether you talk about the AI natives or the others. The AI natives are inflecting in a way that the others are not at this point, so today we see the higher growth on AI natives from traditional enterprises and stable growth but not accelerating from the rest of the pack.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Hello, thank you very much. Oli, you\u2019ve mentioned I think between--on the call, there\u2019s been repeated instance of enterprise growing faster than SMB. I\u2019m curious why is that the case, and is this something of a change in the trend? Have you seen SMBs actually showing better usage trends in the past, and what could cause the SMBs to start to pick up consumption? What are the things that are holding back their consumption, and what could be the unlocks from [indiscernible], because the enterprise is doing well, so obviously the product portfolio is being well received, so what\u2019s stopping the SMBs? Thank you so much once again.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, I don\u2019t know that there is that much of a trend just yet to look at, or there is too much to say at this point. This is just the way the numbers came up over the past quarter or so. I would say, look, there\u2019s many reasons why the SMBs could be more careful in terms of the macro environment, the fact that they have maybe less runway, immediate runway with consolidation and things like that compared to large enterprises, and some of them may be are further along also in that log journey, so the growth there is more tied to their overall growth, as opposed to they\u2019re still transitioning to a next-gen and cloud environment. These are all potential factors. But look, there is no--at this point, I wouldn\u2019t call it a major, super-important difference. I think we\u2019ll have to see what this looks like in a few quarters.\nKash Rangan: Got it, and one for David, if I could. How strong is the delta between enterprise consumption growth versus SMB? Are we talking orders of magnitude or meaningful percentage, or a big percentage?\nOlivier Pomel: No, no. We\u2019re just [indiscernible] a few points, but different trends. That\u2019s it.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, we\u2019re just basically commenting on the line--you know, as we said, they have been around each others, and we\u2019re really commenting more on, as Oli mentioned, enterprise, things like they may have been more careful in the increase of spending. Consolidation continues to be a factor in going to a common platform, but as Oli mentioned, these are sort of comments on the way things are evolving, but we still have pretty similar metrics in all the different segments.\nOlivier Pomel: It\u2019s something that we noted because we--you know, it\u2019s a little bit counterintuitive in that when you look at the overall market, the enterprise is where we have the most mature competition, the most scaled competition, and we are doing better. That part is scaling faster than, I would call it, the less competitive side of the market. But again, not too much to read into it just yet, we\u2019re just informing you of the trend.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment as we move onto our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much, and I\u2019ll add my congrats on the quarter. Olivier, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the LLM Observability product that Mark referenced. When people are thinking about bringing on LLMs into their organization, do they want the observability product in place already, or are they testing out LLMs and then bringing you on after the fact? I\u2019m just wondering, it\u2019s sort of a chicken and egg question, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re someone they want to talk to before they start moving things into production, or it\u2019s after they get something going, they bring you in after the fact?\nOlivier Pomel: I think the first thing I\u2019d say, we expect this market to change a lot over time because it is far from being mature, and so a lot of things that might happen today in a certain way might happen in two years in a very, very different form. That being said, the way it works typically is customers build applications user developer tools, and there\u2019s a whole industry that has emerged around developer tools and playgrounds and things like that for LMs, and so they use not one but 100 different things to do that, which is fairly similar to what you might find on the IDE side or coded [indiscernible] side for the more traditional development. There\u2019s lots of different--it\u2019s a very fragmented environment on that side. When they start connecting the LLMs to the rest of the application, then they start to need visibility that includes the other components, because the LLM doesn\u2019t work in a vacuum, it\u2019s plugged into a front end, it works with authentication and security, it works with--connects to other systems and databases and other services to get the data, and at that point, they need to be integrated with the rest of the observability. For the customers that use the LLM Observability product, they use us for all the rest of their stacks, and it would make absolutely no sense for them to operate their LLMs in isolation completely separately and not have the visibility across all applications, so at that point it\u2019s a no-brainer that they need everything to be integrated in production.\nKirk Materne: That\u2019s helpful. Then David, we can kind of infer your implied [indiscernible] 4Q. I was just wondering, some of the elections in Europe have come up on a couple other calls in terms of [indiscernible] that have been distractions. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on how you think the U.S. election might impact usage, if at all, or if you have any thoughts on that. I realize you guys were a lot smaller last time we had a presidential election.\nDavid Obstler: No, we are not forecasters like that. As you know, usage growth has many factors. The effect of the election on the operation of modern cloud applications is not something that has been a very significant change in usage patterns, for instance, in the European elections, and we wouldn\u2019t anticipate any here as well.\nOlivier Pomel: No impact. The only impact on us of the U.S. election is we\u2019re trying not to schedule our earnings call on the same day.\nKirk Materne: We would appreciate that! Thank you. Thanks guys.\nDavid Obstler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment as we move onto our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nFatima Boolani: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Oli, I wanted to start with you. You and David both talked about improving usage trends, but I wanted to take a step back and ask you, have you seen the quality of the usage improve by virtue or by extension of your introduction of the cloud cost management SKUs - you talked about the Kubernetes with the Autoscaling, and then the original cloud cost management SKU. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s maybe a spurious correlation now that customers have that much more visibility into the mechanics of what they\u2019re spending with you, they\u2019re actually more inclined to drive usage because it\u2019s higher fidelity. Just any commentary on that would be helpful, and then I have a follow-up for David, please.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, I mean, look - in general, customers have invested a lot in understanding their spend, whether that\u2019s on us or on their cloud providers, and as a result, we can say that there\u2019s less, call it overhang of things customers are spending they don\u2019t understand, which is always bad in the long term, so I think customers understand much better the value of what they\u2019re getting in the cloud in general this year than they did two years ago, before this whole optimization movement started. They want more in terms of visibility into what they spend, what actually creates value for them and where they can optimize in the future, so that\u2019s definitely a virtuous cycle that we embark on with our customers in terms of building the right products for that.\nFatima Boolani: I appreciate that. David, as you all kind of roll out more, what I would call resource-intensive or compute-intensive SKUs, like logs, Flex Logs, logs workspaces, I\u2019m wondering if you can shed a little bit of light on some of the gross margin characteristics differ by product pillar. I\u2019m just looking at some of the sequential compression in gross margin, so just wanted to get a better understanding of what are some of the more resource-intensive products that you\u2019re anticipating scaling, that could keep a lid on gross margins in the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, I\u2019ll just go into the numbers first, and then Oli on the engineering side of it. But essentially what we\u2019ve said consistently is that gross margins have operated in a range, they\u2019ve operated towards the top of the range, but there will be variability quarter to quarter as we launch functionality, often having to do with growing out functionality and then optimizing it, and so the movements, the slight movements that we\u2019ve seen quarter to quarter have been the result of that. I\u2019ll turn it over to Oli for more on the engineering.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, there\u2019s definitely nothing to read into the small movements in the gross margins from the product mix perspective. A lot of what happens is we build new features, maybe some of these new features will have more computing impact, more storage impact or something else, maybe also they won\u2019t be fantastically optimized on day one from a code efficiency perspective, or maybe sometimes we\u2019ll focus more on building more things as opposed to optimizing them, because these are the same people, same resources that work on both. What you should expect to see is some ebbs and flows on that number as we keep shooting new features and we keep optimizing. In general, we feel good about the gross margins. We\u2019re not constrained in terms of what we can build by the margin profile we have, and also should we need them, we have many levers to improve these margins as well, so I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the small changes, and we\u2019d expect some more of those small changes in the future. [Indiscernible] we feel good about that.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nMatt Hedberg: Great, thanks guys. Oli, in your prepared remarks, you talked a lot about security and noted data security as a new growth engine from a product perspective. I\u2019m curious, can you talk about how customers might leverage that offering versus maybe other traditional data security offerings in maybe, like, DLP for instance?\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, it\u2019s interesting because the--in many ways, we\u2019ve been doing data security for a while now. On top of our logging product, we started building essentially data scanning which was very successful with customers. We expanded that to cover data flows inside APM traces, that flows between the front end and the back end and really the monitoring. We basically heard our customers ask for more - basically they wanted to not just do data in transit but also see where data was exposed [indiscernible], and so that\u2019s what we extended to the rest of data security. You can see customers coming to that from two different sides on our end. One is customers adopting our security suite, and data security is little by little becoming part of [indiscernible] security in general. But we also see customers coming to it from the log and ATM side, basically, where they start from the applications and they want to track where the data is, so it serves both sides, basically, and it plays to the strategy we have integrating both observability and security into one platform.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it, super helpful. Then as we get into 3Q and the U.S. Fed spending quarter, what are your thoughts on federal spending just in general might play out in Q3 relative to your assumptions?\nOlivier Pomel: Well, we are building out the capacity for it, so. We have build-up to do on several sides. We have the go-to-market capacity to build, we also are still pursuing more government certifications and government-specific deployments to open up some more of the market there, but that\u2019s definitely [indiscernible] investment for us.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Well done.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nJake Roberge: Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to follow up on the enterprise strength that you saw in the quarter. Are you starting to see enterprises re-engage with their cloud migration efforts which is helping drive that growth, or is the strength more related to just general platform usage and expansion?\nOlivier Pomel: They never stopped their enterprise migrations. I think maybe some of the usage was not growing as quickly for some time, maybe some short term optimization efforts were ongoing, but the direction was always the same. Also, they never stopped growing with us in the cloud, so we definitely saw that throughout the past couple of years. Some of the strength we see today has to do with the fact that to serve their--the emergence of AI has reaffirmed for them the need to go to the cloud sooner rather than later so they can build the right kind of applications, they have the right kind of data available to build these applications. But also, we have more to offer, like we have--we can do more--consolidate more of what they were using before, and that gives us more avenues to grow these customers in the short term.\nDavid Obstler: I think we\u2019ve said over the quarters that one enterprise is very early in their journey, and there is a lot of white space too that we said a couple quarters ago, the enterprises had started to resume more normal activity and deploying of the modern cloud applications, and as Oli mentioned, there\u2019s opportunities also for consolidation in the cloud platform, that we\u2019ve talked about many times.\nOlivier Pomel: I\u2019d point you to the numbers we shared, I think two quarters ago in terms of our enterprise penetration and the average size of our contracts with enterprises, which are still fairly small. There\u2019s a lot of runway there, and the growth--although the count is not predicated on the growth of the enterprises themselves, they\u2019re still early in their transformation.\nJake Roberge: Okay, very helpful. Then you\u2019ve talked a decent amount about the demand you\u2019re seeing from AI native customers, but how are you thinking about driving growth with your own AI solutions, like Bits AI and LLM Observability, and when do you think those start to layer more meaningfully into the model? Thanks.\nOlivier Pomel: Yes, I mean right now, the first area of direct application of Bits AI is in incident management and incident resolution, so that is tied more to the SKUs we\u2019re selling there in terms of incident management. But this area is not the only ingredient of that product. Part of it is what we had already in terms of the mechanics of incident management, part of it is also the new Encore product we announced, and part of it is going to be the [indiscernible] and we\u2019re integrating all that to have a fantastic end-to-end experience for our customers that almost makes them want to have incidents--no, actually they still don\u2019t want to have incidents, but the point here is it should really help them.\nOperator: Thank you, and we\u2019ll move onto our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with BofA. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nKoji Ikeda: Yes, great. Thanks guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one from me. I wanted to ask on the usage growth trends. In the prepared remarks, you said a lot about trends exiting this quarter versus 2Q of last quarter, and the first half of this year being better than the first half of last year. But the question here is, how did Q2 this year compare to Q1 this year? Thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, so we had normal seasonality related to the number of days in the quarter and customer behavior in--as they launch new applications, so we saw--we really look at it because of the seasonality over quarters, so the usage growth exhibited the same patterns improvement over last year\u2019s similar period, looking at the days, as it did in the first quarter.\nKoji Ikeda: Got it, David. One quick follow-up, if I may here. The follow-up would be, I know in the Q, you give a net new revenue growth split between existing and new. I was wondering if we could get that mix now, or maybe at least some color in that mix - last quarter was 70% coming from net new from existing. Was it higher or lower this quarter from that 70% mark?\nDavid Obstler: It\u2019s going to be 75/25 - 25 from new, 75 which would be--what we said all along is that as net retention recovers and usage growth is higher than the previous comparable period, as you go back through our history, you will see that the amount from existing customers relative to new logos has generally increased.\nKoji Ikeda: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Yi Fu Lee with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nYi Fu Lee: Thank you so much for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. In terms of the new products that were launched at DASH, a lot of stuff going on in LLM, AI apps, etc. Olivier and David, which one are you most bullish near term, and then longer term?\nOlivier Pomel: Well you know, it\u2019s always hard to have a favorite child in all of the amazing things that we\u2019re shipping. Look, I think the short term, the ones that are going to have the most impact are the ones that relate to the products that already have scale, so anything we do that facilitates the deployment of [indiscernible] at scale has a large impact. Everything we do that makes--that changes the economics of logs or opens up new markets within our legacy logging area user base has a huge impact. What we\u2019re doing with OpenTelemetry has a large impact because it\u2019s a big trend in the industry, and we\u2019re making bold moves there. Longer term, look - we think there\u2019s a very large opportunity for us to do a lot of automation we have with our customers, and you see that, whether that\u2019s on the observability side or the security side, with all the diverse ways in which we are taking action into the product, we are fixing things for customers, we\u2019re driving them to take the next step. We are organizing the tracking of the workflows that they\u2019re running from end to end, so this is a longer build, but I think in the long run it makes a very large difference in terms of value we can provide to our customers.\nYi Fu Lee: Excellent, Oli. Just a quick follow-up for David - NRR is at the mid 110 level. What needs to happen in order for Datadog to go back to above the 120 level? I mean, it sounds like the trends are very, very healthy month to month, quarter over quarter, so just some commentary around [indiscernible] for me, thank you.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, we don\u2019t give that forecast. The components are the use of existing products and the cross-sell, and so as you mentioned both of those have been stronger in the first half of this year than they were last year, and we\u2019ll see what happens, but we don\u2019t give guidance or forecast on net retention. Thanks.\nYi Fu Lee: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville from Scotiabank. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nPatrick Colville: All right, terrific. Thank you so much for having me on. [Indiscernible], David, one of the themes you\u2019ve talked about in the past is competitive dynamics in observability. There have been a lot of corporate transactions in the space over the past year, so I guess how are you seeing competition versus your open source peers, platform peers, peers that are private versus a couple quarters ago?\nOlivier Pomel: In general, the competition is very much unchanged. There\u2019s nothing super specific to say about that. I think we have some of the scale players that have been disappearing to a certain extent as a result of the transactions you mentioned, but we expect that to play out more in the midterm than in the very short term in the marketplace. We do have scale competition still in terms of product companies that are competing with us on observability, and there\u2019s no change in the posture there. We like the way we\u2019re performing, and a number of the large deals we\u2019ve mentioned, we were displacement or wins against some of these folks - we feel very good about that. Then on the low end, there\u2019s been pretty much a rotating cast of sub-scale companies that are going after that market, and that will also unchanged in the [indiscernible] pretty much, so nothing to report there. I think largely when we build products, we build it with customers, we don\u2019t build it with competition in mind, the few exceptions being when we see large [indiscernible] opportunities in the market because of big changes and big transactions that you mentioned already.\nPatrick Colville: Okay, very helpful. I guess David, looking at the 3Q revenue guidance, it looks like the kind of buoyant trend you saw this quarter will continue. Can you just put a fine pin, if possible, on the trend we saw through July and thus far in August?\nDavid Obstler: Yes, I think what we\u2019ve seen since the quarter, as we mentioned, is a continuation of better usage trends relative to the comparable period last year, so more of the same. In our guidance philosophy, it hasn\u2019t changed - we take those trends, as much information as we have, and apply discount and conservatism, given that we don\u2019t control the consumption of our clients, we observe it. It\u2019s a very similar methodology to what we\u2019ve used in previous quarters and a continuation of the trends we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year.\nPatrick Colville: Terrific, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nTaz Koujalgi: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I have a question for David on your sequential revenue growth this quarter. I\u2019m trying to reconcile the comments you made about the usage growth in this quarter being better than last year, because if you look at the revenue growth sequentially, that\u2019s slowed down. I think it\u2019s the lowest Q2 sequential growth in the longest time. One more question was, if you look at the sequential growth for the last three, four quarters, it\u2019s really accelerating since your optimization trends, and that trend kind of, I guess, it buckled this quarter because the Q-over-Q growth in Q2 was lower than what you had last year, so just trying to reconcile the commentary about usage growth being strong but then the revenue growth sequentially looks a little bit lighter than last year.\nDavid Obstler: Yes, a lot of that has to do with what we said, which is that in the second half of December, clients are not at their desks and new deployments have been frozen, so we generally find that the usage or revenue run rate growth goes down or is the same, and then we find a recovery as people get back to their desks in Q1. Then we find in Q2, a similar linearity pattern that we see in all Q2s, which is how it\u2019s sort of people work, and so we didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary in terms of the time series of Q4 to Q1 to Q2.\nTaz Koujalgi: Got it, and just one follow-up - David, you mentioned that revenue is the best metric for your business, we shouldn\u2019t be looking at billings and RPO bookings. But I\u2019m just wondering, any color your can provide on the first half bookings growth this year? It\u2019s been flat year-over-year but you\u2019re recent increasing it. That\u2019s, I think, the lowest bookings growth again in any first half of your year. Any more commentary beyond what you already provided? Is the renewal base lighter in the first half? Should we expect an acceleration in the second half? Any more color on the bookings momentum?\nDavid Obstler: No. If you look at the latest 12 months of all these trends, they all eventually converge around revenues. It has to do with, as we\u2019ve mentioned in every earnings call, when bills go out, whether the deals are multi-year or single-year, etc., so no, all of that essentially balances out back to the metrics that we direct you to, which is revenue and then ARR, so no, nothing in it.\nTaz Koujalgi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, and I would now like to hand the conference back over to Olivier Pomel for any further remarks.\nOlivier Pomel : Thank you, and just to close the call, I want to thank again everybody who was involved in DASH this year, so that means obviously the product engineering teams who shift these amazing products, and there were lots of them. It means the go-to-market teams that have relayed the message to our customers. That means the marketing and community teams that did such a fantastic job putting on the show, and of course that means the customers who showed up in large numbers with enthusiasm, and who have been the life of the conference. Thank you everyone, and we\u2019ll see you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a very productive second quarter. First, we welcomed thousands of Datadog users to our DASH conference in June, where we announced a broad range of exciting new products and new features for customers to observe, secure and act in their cloud environment, and we continued to add new customers and help existing ones as they grow in the cloud. Let me start with a review of our Q2 financial performance. Revenue was $645 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 28,700 customers, up from about 26,100 a year ago. We had about 3,390 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,990 last year, and these customers generated about 87% of our ARR, and we generated free cash flow of $144 million with a free cash flow margin of 22%. Turning to platform adoption, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 82% a year ago. Forty-nine percent of customers were using four or more products, up from 45% a year ago. Twenty-five percent of our customers were using six or more products, up from 21% a year ago, and 11% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 7% a year ago. We continue to expand the capabilities of all of our products over time, enabling our customers to solve more of their critical challenges. These include our efforts in digital experience monitoring, an area of observability which includes synthetics and real user monitoring, or ROM, and both synthetics and ROM are seeing growing adoption and each product today represents more than $100 million in ARR, becoming our fourth and fifth products to achieve that milestone. We have also been innovating rapidly in this area with recent capabilities including mobile app testing, feature flag testing, user journey visualization, and retention analysis, and with our recent announcement of [indiscernible] at DASH, we are excited to go further and allow our customers to consolidate of their usage and business insights into Datadog. Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, the business environment for Datadog was roughly unchanged from last quarter. More customers overall are growing their cloud usage, while some are continuing to be cost conscious. In Q2, we saw existing customer usage growth that was broadly in line with our expectations and consistent with the overall improved trend that we had experienced over the past several quarters. Our usage growth with existing customers was higher than in the year ago quarter, and we saw continued healthy growth across our product line with newer products growing faster from a smaller base. Finally, churn continues to be low and gross revenue retention was stable in the mid to high 90s, highlighting the mission critical nature of our platform for our customers. Moving onto R&D, we held our DASH user conference in late June and were excited to announce many new products and features for our users. There's too much for us to cover in detail, but let me review just some of the announcements we made in the past three months. In the next-gen AI space, we announced the general availability of LLM Observability, which allows application developers and machine learning engineers to efficiently monitor, troubleshoot and secure LLM applications. With LLM Observability, companies can accelerate the development of AI applications into production environments and reliably operate and scale them. We also expanded Bits AI with new capabilities. As a reminder, Bits AI is a Datadog built-in AI copilot. In addition to being able to summarize incidents and answer questions, we previewed at DASH the ability for Bits AI to operate as an agent and perform autonomous investigations. With this capability, Bits AI proactively surfaces key information and performs complex tasks such as investigating alerts and coordinating incident response. Taking a step back and looking at our customer base, we continue to see a lot of excitement around AI technology. More customers are telling us that they are levering up on AI and ramping up experimentation with the goal of delivering additional business value with AI, and we can see them doing this. Today about 2,500 customers use one or more of our AI integrations to get visibility into their increasing use of AI. We also continue to grow our business with AI-native customers, which increased to over 4% of our ARR in June. We see this as a sign of the continuing expansion of this ecosystem and of the value of using Datadog to monitor the production environment. I will note that over time, we think these metrics will become less relevant as AI usage and production broadens beyond this group of customers. Last but not least, we announced Toto, our first foundation model for time series forecasting, which delivers state-of-the-art performance on all relevant benchmarks. In addition to the technical innovations devised by our resource team, Toto derives its record performance from the quality of our training datasets and points to our unique ability to train, build and incorporate AI models into a platform that will meaningfully improve operations for our customers. Moving on from AI, we had a lot more to show in Observability. We announced the general availability of Flex Logs, which expands our Logging without Limits approach and allows our customers to scale storage and compute separately for cost efficiency. Our customers can today use our new Log Workspace for log analysis. Log Workspace is an advanced analytic feature that allows users to connect datasets, build and visualize complex queries, and create readable, [indiscernible] views and reports. It is particularly relevant to customers who previously built sophisticated analysis and workflows in legacy log management tools. We announced the general availability of Data Jobs Monitoring, which allows data engineers to detect and fix issues with their Spark and Databricks workloads and to optimize the cost and performance of their data jobs. Moving and transforming large amounts of data has grown importance and become a mission critical capability for many businesses, a trend that we believe will continue with the adoption of AI. With this, our data observability set of products is expanding. Data jobs monitoring works alongside our data streams monitoring product, which helps customers understand their queueing pipeline in moving components such as Kafka or RabbitMQ, and we're increasingly providing visibility for data lakes and data warehouses such as Snowflake to deliver end-to-end data observability across customer data resources. Moving on from data observability, we introduced Kubernetes Autoscaling to all our customers to optimize forecast and performance while automatically right-sizing Kubernetes resources. For our customers using OpenTelemetry, the Datadog agent will embed a fully configurable OpenTelemetry collector, giving [indiscernible] customers access to Datadog products such as container, network and universal service monitoring, and offering our customers what we believe will be the best fully managed OpenTelemetry experience in the market. In shifting left, our new live debugger enables developers to step through code directly in production environments and find the exact root cause of production errors. As I mentioned earlier, we are building up on our success in digital experience monitoring and [indiscernible] providing in-depth product and user insights for product managers and business owners. In the cloud security space, we launched a new application security capability called Code Security, which allows our customers to detect and prioritize code-level vulnerability in their products and applications. We also announced Data Security, which allows our customers to automatically pinpoint sensitive data, starting in [indiscernible] today and expanding to other environments in the future. For instances where customers can't or don't want to deploy agents, our new agent-less scanning capability provides visibility into risks and vulnerabilities within hosts' containers and [indiscernible] functions without requiring agents to be installed. Finally in the cloud service management space, we're going further to allow our customers to take actions directly within Datadog's platform. We announced the general availability of App Builder, which lets teams rapidly create self-service local applications and integrate them securely into their monitoring stacks, and we introduced Datadog On Call, a modern on-call experience with paging and internet management workflows fully integrated with observability. Let's move on now to sales and marketing. We again saw strong execution from our go-to-market teams this quarter and we added some exciting new customers while expanding with many more, so let's go through a few examples. First, we landed our largest ever new logo win, a multi-year deal with total contract value in the tens of millions of dollars, with one of the largest banks in South America. This customer was using a commercial observability product as well as open source tools but didn't have full stack visibility. With Datadog, they will enable end-to-end observability and they expect to transition to modern infrastructure with confidence. They also anticipate better management and predictability of their observability costs thanks to products such as Flex Log. Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized land deal with one of the world's largest travel management companies. This company was using a commercial log management tool but found it expensive and complex to support. They also worried about stability as the tool would crash and cause fire drills across the organization. By moving to Datadog and replacing this tool, they expect to drive significant savings with log management and will benefit from a unified platform across infrastructure monitoring and APM. Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized land with a security software company. This customer felt they were overspending on their commercial logging tool and lack of visibility led to issues catching incidents, with users notifying them first of outages. This customer is now adopting the Datadog unified platform across all three pillars and displacing one commercial and two open source tools in the process. This customer also expects net savings of half a million dollars every year by switching to Datadog. Next, we signed a seven-figure annual expansion with a leading central bank in Europe. This institution became a Datadog customer three years ago to enable its ambitious plan to move half of its applications to the cloud over a couple of years, and they have been increasing their usage of Datadog as they moved into the cloud, displacing two commercial observability tools which they used in their on-premise environment. They have now adopted a total of 17 Datadog products. Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a large American insurance company. This company had been using Datadog for full stack observability at one business unit. With this expansion, they have chosen Datadog as their enterprise-wide observability provider. In comparing us to the performance of other tools, this customer measured strong [indiscernible] adoption and fewer incidents with Datadog, and in displacing its legacy ATM and log management, they expect to save over $1 million annually on tool costs alone. Finally, we signed a high seven-figure annualized expansion with a leading online gambling and entertainment platform. This long-time customer uses Datadog as its strategic observability partner, enabling full visibility across infrastructure applications, logs, network, and their public [indiscernible] with users spanning from hands on keyboard engineers all the way to their [indiscernible]. This renewal supports this customer's expansion into new use cases through our security embedded into their operations by using all of our cloud security products, to build a culture of cost accountability with cloud cost management, and to take action using incident management and workflow automation. This customer to date has adopted 19 products in the Datadog platform. That's it for another productive quarter for our go-to-market teams. Now let me say a few words on our longer term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change to the multi-year trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We are seeing continued experimentation with new technologies, including next-gen AI, and we believe this is just one of the many factors that will drive greater use of the cloud and next-gen infrastructure. As indicated by our many announcements at our DASH user conference, we are delivering rapid innovation at scale and we are helping our customers every day to deploy and scale the modern environment with confidence across observability, digital experience, cloud security, cloud service management, software delivery, and product analytics. Finally, I'd like to welcome two new leaders to our team. Yanbing Li is joining us as our Chief Product Officer. Yanbing has more than 25 years of product, technology and engineering experience spanning enterprise software, cloud infrastructure and AI at companies such as VMware, Google and Aurora. She will lead our product team's efforts to expand the Datadog platform. David Galloreese is joining us as our Chief People Officer. David has more than 20 years of HR experience at tech companies and large scale high visibility enterprises such as Figma, Wells Fargo, and Wal-Mart. He will help us drive the next chapter of growth and scale at Datadog. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David? No, there's no change to the way we see things. Because we have this [indiscernible] strategy where we're building a consolidator and we're bringing together many different use cases into one shared platform, we have very broad interest and a very ambitious road map in many different directions, so as a result, we cast a very wide net when it comes to M&A. There are many possible potential fits for us. Historically we've been very successful with doing a lot of small and medium-sized deals. At any point in time, we are going to look at a lot of deals that might be small or big. We expect the bigger deals to be fewer and far between as the bar is very high for those, and today we're also not looking into anything that would be very material to the business. Yes, so obviously this is something that was very much in the news, was very visible. It was particularly visible because it affected devices, airport kiosks basically and point of sale, that are in the field in front of consumers, and it was pretty much everywhere at once, so very visible incident. That being said, in the grand scheme of observability, it's very unremarkable, so the Crowdstrike isn't very visible to everyone, everywhere, but every single day there's a hundred or a thousand companies that are having their Crowdstrike moment because they have outdated software--you know, third party software [indiscernible] they have built and that caused large business disruptions [indiscernible] and that's what we deal with pretty much all the time. What you see in the public eye is really a reflection of the value we provide every single day to our customers when it comes to preventing these issues, and whenever those issues happen, to remediate them extremely quickly. Of course, we had all of the interactions you can imagine with our customers around--you know, in terms of how to use our product to come back online, debug and everything, given the fix in that case was very, very manual - there was really no good way to automate it. But again, we see that every single day, that's what we do. Yes, we definitely think there is going to be more opportunity in the future, which is why we're investing heavily both in terms of making large [indiscernible] to scale, that's Flex Logs in particular, and also going further in terms of the sophistication of the functionality we can offer to customers so they can build very complex processes around those. We talked about log workspace also in the call, log workspace is particularly interesting for customers who have used other platforms and have built pipelines basically that must process a lot of logs data, and so we build that for them and that's been very well received so far. All of that is in service of going after these opportunities. Yes, look - as you know, it's still early. We do see customers that are moving increasingly into production, and we have a few of those. We named a couple as early customers of LLM Observability - I think the two we named were WHOOP, the fitness band, and AppFolio. We see many more that are lining up and that are going to do that, but in the grand scheme of things, looking at the whole market, it's still very early. I would say the best proxy you can get from the future demand there is the growth of the model providers and the AI natives, because they tend to be the ones that currently are being used to provide AI functionality into other applications, and largely in production environments, and so what we said there, the harbinger of what's to come. For us, I will add that the digital natives are largely SMB and midmarket, they're not enterprise. Even when you look at the digital natives, there is two stories depending on whether you talk about the AI natives or the others. The AI natives are inflecting in a way that the others are not at this point, so today we see the higher growth on AI natives from traditional enterprises and stable growth but not accelerating from the rest of the pack. Yes, I don't know that there is that much of a trend just yet to look at, or there is too much to say at this point. This is just the way the numbers came up over the past quarter or so. I would say, look, there's many reasons why the SMBs could be more careful in terms of the macro environment, the fact that they have maybe less runway, immediate runway with consolidation and things like that compared to large enterprises, and some of them may be are further along also in that log journey, so the growth there is more tied to their overall growth, as opposed to they're still transitioning to a next-gen and cloud environment. These are all potential factors. But look, there is no--at this point, I wouldn't call it a major, super-important difference. I think we'll have to see what this looks like in a few quarters. No, no. We're just [indiscernible] a few points, but different trends. That's it. It's something that we noted because we--you know, it's a little bit counterintuitive in that when you look at the overall market, the enterprise is where we have the most mature competition, the most scaled competition, and we are doing better. That part is scaling faster than, I would call it, the less competitive side of the market. But again, not too much to read into it just yet, we're just informing you of the trend. I think the first thing I'd say, we expect this market to change a lot over time because it is far from being mature, and so a lot of things that might happen today in a certain way might happen in two years in a very, very different form. That being said, the way it works typically is customers build applications user developer tools, and there's a whole industry that has emerged around developer tools and playgrounds and things like that for LMs, and so they use not one but 100 different things to do that, which is fairly similar to what you might find on the IDE side or coded [indiscernible] side for the more traditional development. There's lots of different--it's a very fragmented environment on that side. When they start connecting the LLMs to the rest of the application, then they start to need visibility that includes the other components, because the LLM doesn't work in a vacuum, it's plugged into a front end, it works with authentication and security, it works with--connects to other systems and databases and other services to get the data, and at that point, they need to be integrated with the rest of the observability. For the customers that use the LLM Observability product, they use us for all the rest of their stacks, and it would make absolutely no sense for them to operate their LLMs in isolation completely separately and not have the visibility across all applications, so at that point it's a no-brainer that they need everything to be integrated in production. No impact. The only impact on us of the U.S. election is we're trying not to schedule our earnings call on the same day. Yes, I mean, look - in general, customers have invested a lot in understanding their spend, whether that's on us or on their cloud providers, and as a result, we can say that there's less, call it overhang of things customers are spending they don't understand, which is always bad in the long term, so I think customers understand much better the value of what they're getting in the cloud in general this year than they did two years ago, before this whole optimization movement started. They want more in terms of visibility into what they spend, what actually creates value for them and where they can optimize in the future, so that's definitely a virtuous cycle that we embark on with our customers in terms of building the right products for that. Yes, there's definitely nothing to read into the small movements in the gross margins from the product mix perspective. A lot of what happens is we build new features, maybe some of these new features will have more computing impact, more storage impact or something else, maybe also they won't be fantastically optimized on day one from a code efficiency perspective, or maybe sometimes we'll focus more on building more things as opposed to optimizing them, because these are the same people, same resources that work on both. What you should expect to see is some ebbs and flows on that number as we keep shooting new features and we keep optimizing. In general, we feel good about the gross margins. We're not constrained in terms of what we can build by the margin profile we have, and also should we need them, we have many levers to improve these margins as well, so I wouldn't read too much into the small changes, and we'd expect some more of those small changes in the future. [Indiscernible] we feel good about that. Yes, it's interesting because the--in many ways, we've been doing data security for a while now. On top of our logging product, we started building essentially data scanning which was very successful with customers. We expanded that to cover data flows inside APM traces, that flows between the front end and the back end and really the monitoring. We basically heard our customers ask for more - basically they wanted to not just do data in transit but also see where data was exposed [indiscernible], and so that's what we extended to the rest of data security. You can see customers coming to that from two different sides on our end. One is customers adopting our security suite, and data security is little by little becoming part of [indiscernible] security in general. But we also see customers coming to it from the log and ATM side, basically, where they start from the applications and they want to track where the data is, so it serves both sides, basically, and it plays to the strategy we have integrating both observability and security into one platform. Well, we are building out the capacity for it, so. We have build-up to do on several sides. We have the go-to-market capacity to build, we also are still pursuing more government certifications and government-specific deployments to open up some more of the market there, but that's definitely [indiscernible] investment for us. They never stopped their enterprise migrations. I think maybe some of the usage was not growing as quickly for some time, maybe some short term optimization efforts were ongoing, but the direction was always the same. Also, they never stopped growing with us in the cloud, so we definitely saw that throughout the past couple of years. Some of the strength we see today has to do with the fact that to serve their--the emergence of AI has reaffirmed for them the need to go to the cloud sooner rather than later so they can build the right kind of applications, they have the right kind of data available to build these applications. But also, we have more to offer, like we have--we can do more--consolidate more of what they were using before, and that gives us more avenues to grow these customers in the short term. I'd point you to the numbers we shared, I think two quarters ago in terms of our enterprise penetration and the average size of our contracts with enterprises, which are still fairly small. There's a lot of runway there, and the growth--although the count is not predicated on the growth of the enterprises themselves, they're still early in their transformation. Yes, I mean right now, the first area of direct application of Bits AI is in incident management and incident resolution, so that is tied more to the SKUs we're selling there in terms of incident management. But this area is not the only ingredient of that product. Part of it is what we had already in terms of the mechanics of incident management, part of it is also the new Encore product we announced, and part of it is going to be the [indiscernible] and we're integrating all that to have a fantastic end-to-end experience for our customers that almost makes them want to have incidents--no, actually they still don't want to have incidents, but the point here is it should really help them. Well you know, it's always hard to have a favorite child in all of the amazing things that we're shipping. Look, I think the short term, the ones that are going to have the most impact are the ones that relate to the products that already have scale, so anything we do that facilitates the deployment of [indiscernible] at scale has a large impact. Everything we do that makes--that changes the economics of logs or opens up new markets within our legacy logging area user base has a huge impact. What we're doing with OpenTelemetry has a large impact because it's a big trend in the industry, and we're making bold moves there. Longer term, look - we think there's a very large opportunity for us to do a lot of automation we have with our customers, and you see that, whether that's on the observability side or the security side, with all the diverse ways in which we are taking action into the product, we are fixing things for customers, we're driving them to take the next step. We are organizing the tracking of the workflows that they're running from end to end, so this is a longer build, but I think in the long run it makes a very large difference in terms of value we can provide to our customers. In general, the competition is very much unchanged. There's nothing super specific to say about that. I think we have some of the scale players that have been disappearing to a certain extent as a result of the transactions you mentioned, but we expect that to play out more in the midterm than in the very short term in the marketplace. We do have scale competition still in terms of product companies that are competing with us on observability, and there's no change in the posture there. We like the way we're performing, and a number of the large deals we've mentioned, we were displacement or wins against some of these folks - we feel very good about that. Then on the low end, there's been pretty much a rotating cast of sub-scale companies that are going after that market, and that will also unchanged in the [indiscernible] pretty much, so nothing to report there. I think largely when we build products, we build it with customers, we don't build it with competition in mind, the few exceptions being when we see large [indiscernible] opportunities in the market because of big changes and big transactions that you mentioned already. Thank you, and just to close the call, I want to thank again everybody who was involved in DASH this year, so that means obviously the product engineering teams who shift these amazing products, and there were lots of them. It means the go-to-market teams that have relayed the message to our customers. That means the marketing and community teams that did such a fantastic job putting on the show, and of course that means the customers who showed up in large numbers with enthusiasm, and who have been the life of the conference. Thank you everyone, and we'll see you next quarter."

            "name": "David Obstler",
            "content": "Thanks Olivier, and good morning to all. Q2 revenues were $645 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q2 revenue growth, first regarding usage growth from existing customers, the overall trend we saw was consistent with our expectations. In Q2, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than usage growth in the year-ago quarter, and as we look across the first half of 2024, our usage growth was higher than the first half of 2023. We are seeing solid growth across our products. Our three pillar products continue to increase in customer penetration and usage, and our newer products across observability, cloud security and cloud service management are ramping. Regarding usage growth by customer size in Q2, we saw strong performance amongst our largest customers, who spend multiple millions of dollars with us annually as they continue to return to growth and strike a balance between new deployment and focus on optimization. As we look at usage growth by segment, we saw the strongest growth with our enterprise customers, where year-over-year growth in usage has accelerated over the past several quarters. Over the same period, we have seen more steady year-over-year growth trends amongst our SMB and midmarket customers. As a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with 5,000 employees or more, midmarket as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees, and SMB as customers with less than 1,000 employees. Regarding our retention metrics, our net revenue retention percentage was in the mid 110s in Q2, similar to the past couple quarters; but remember, this is a trailing 12-month measure and we've seen an increase in recent quarters as we look at the NRR quarterly trend. Finally, our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remained stable in the mid to high 90s. Now moving onto our financial results, billings were $667 million, up 28% year-over-year and similar to the trailing 12 months billing year-over-year growth. Billings duration was roughly flat versus a year ago. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO was $1.79 billion, up 43% year-over-year. As we've said before, contract duration has generally been increasing as customers choose more multi-year deals, and contract duration increased modestly in the year-over-year period relative to a year ago. Current RPO growth was in the mid-30% year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO, as those can fluctuate on a quarterly basis relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts. Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $530 million, representing a gross margin of 82.1%. This compares to a gross margin of 83.3% in the last quarter and 81.3% in the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 opex grew 21% year-over-year and increased from 14% year-over-year growth last quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, Q2 opex included $11 million in expenses related to our DASH user conference, and as we've discussed, we are investing in headcount in 2024 and the growth in opex reflects our execution on hiring in sales and marketing and R&D so far this year. Q2 operating income was $158 million, or 24% operating margin compared to 27% last quarter and 21% in the year-ago quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $164 million in the quarter, and after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $144 million for free cash flow margin of 22%. Now for our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2024, first our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $660 million to $664 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $146 million to $150 million, which implies an operating margin of 22% to 23%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.38 to $0.40 per share based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.63 billion, which represents 23% to 24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $620 million to $630 million, which implies an operating margin of 24%, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.66 per share, based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Some additional notes to our guidance, we expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $125 million. Next, we expect to pay cash taxes in the range of $20 million to $25 million, and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenues range in fiscal 2024. Now to conclude, as Oli mentioned, we are pleased with our execution in the first half of 2024 and plan to continue to help our customers observe, secure and act in their modern cloud environments. I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in this. With that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yes, thanks Sanjit, and hello. Again, as I think you've noted, we've said that we experienced strength in our enterprise segment and stability in our SMB segment, and that continued throughout the quarter. As far as the more recent trends for what we're seeing towards the end of the quarter and also in July, very similar trends to what we saw in Q2 and for the first half of the year, so a continuation of higher usage growth than we saw in the comparable periods in the previous year. Yes, as you know, we've said that--so when you look at the time series, the peak of the optimization was in Q2, Q3 last year, and we've had a time series of higher usage growth for our clients month to month since then, and that's continued through the first half of the year and into July. The usage growth, as we talked about, is stronger in the enterprise and in the larger users, but it has been fairly stable in the SMB, so we're seeing some more--when you look at the chart and the line, enterprise usage growth being higher than it had been and SMB being stable. Yes, we're just basically commenting on the line--you know, as we said, they have been around each others, and we're really commenting more on, as Oli mentioned, enterprise, things like they may have been more careful in the increase of spending. Consolidation continues to be a factor in going to a common platform, but as Oli mentioned, these are sort of comments on the way things are evolving, but we still have pretty similar metrics in all the different segments. No, we are not forecasters like that. As you know, usage growth has many factors. The effect of the election on the operation of modern cloud applications is not something that has been a very significant change in usage patterns, for instance, in the European elections, and we wouldn't anticipate any here as well. Thank you. Yes, I'll just go into the numbers first, and then Oli on the engineering side of it. But essentially what we've said consistently is that gross margins have operated in a range, they've operated towards the top of the range, but there will be variability quarter to quarter as we launch functionality, often having to do with growing out functionality and then optimizing it, and so the movements, the slight movements that we've seen quarter to quarter have been the result of that. I'll turn it over to Oli for more on the engineering. I think we've said over the quarters that one enterprise is very early in their journey, and there is a lot of white space too that we said a couple quarters ago, the enterprises had started to resume more normal activity and deploying of the modern cloud applications, and as Oli mentioned, there's opportunities also for consolidation in the cloud platform, that we've talked about many times. Yes, so we had normal seasonality related to the number of days in the quarter and customer behavior in--as they launch new applications, so we saw--we really look at it because of the seasonality over quarters, so the usage growth exhibited the same patterns improvement over last year's similar period, looking at the days, as it did in the first quarter. It's going to be 75/25 - 25 from new, 75 which would be--what we said all along is that as net retention recovers and usage growth is higher than the previous comparable period, as you go back through our history, you will see that the amount from existing customers relative to new logos has generally increased. Yes, we don't give that forecast. The components are the use of existing products and the cross-sell, and so as you mentioned both of those have been stronger in the first half of this year than they were last year, and we'll see what happens, but we don't give guidance or forecast on net retention. Thanks. Yes, I think what we've seen since the quarter, as we mentioned, is a continuation of better usage trends relative to the comparable period last year, so more of the same. In our guidance philosophy, it hasn't changed - we take those trends, as much information as we have, and apply discount and conservatism, given that we don't control the consumption of our clients, we observe it. It's a very similar methodology to what we've used in previous quarters and a continuation of the trends we've seen in the first half of the year. Yes, a lot of that has to do with what we said, which is that in the second half of December, clients are not at their desks and new deployments have been frozen, so we generally find that the usage or revenue run rate growth goes down or is the same, and then we find a recovery as people get back to their desks in Q1. Then we find in Q2, a similar linearity pattern that we see in all Q2s, which is how it's sort of people work, and so we didn't see anything out of the ordinary in terms of the time series of Q4 to Q1 to Q2. No. If you look at the latest 12 months of all these trends, they all eventually converge around revenues. It has to do with, as we've mentioned in every earnings call, when bills go out, whether the deals are multi-year or single-year, etc., so no, all of that essentially balances out back to the metrics that we direct you to, which is revenue and then ARR, so no, nothing in it."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nYuka Broderick: Thank you, Marvin. Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's First Quarter 2024 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.\n During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage optimization trends. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\n For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.\n We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. \nOlivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution at the start of 2024. First, we have continued to broaden our platform across observability, cloud security, software delivery as well as closing the loop with cloud service management. We also kept supporting our customers' adoption of new technologies including next-gen AI and large language models. And we have continued to add new customers and to see existing customers increase their usage growth and product adoption.\n Let me start with a review of our Q1 financial performance. Revenue was $611 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 28,000 customers, up from about 25,500 last year. We had about 3,340 customers, with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,910 last year. These customers generated about 87% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $187 million, with a free cash flow margin of 31%.\n Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 82% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 81% a year ago. 47% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 43% a year ago. 23% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 19% a year ago. And 10% of our customers were using 8 or more products, up from 7% last year.\n We continue to see robust growth in our 3 pillars of observability: Infrastructure monitoring, APM and log management. But we also have many younger products that are becoming more meaningful contributors to our business over time. For example, our products outside of infrastructure monitoring, APM suite and Log Management exceeded $200 million in ARR in Q1. And as a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, Synthetics, RUM and Continuous Profiler. And as we look at the 12 products that we launched between 2020 and 2022, those now contribute about 11% to our ARR.\n Of those 12 products, 8 are over $10 million in ARR, which is a nice milestone for these relatively new additions. And we are seeing some products grow faster than we initially expected. For example, Database Monitoring is already 1% of our revenue with strong and growing product penetration across our customer base. So we are very pleased with the progress of our newer products, even though we know we have much further to go with them.\n Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q1, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than in Q4. And this usage growth in Q1 was similar to what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of 2022. As a reminder, that was a period when we started to see a normalization of usage following the accelerated growth we had experienced in 2021. Overall, we saw healthy growth across our product lines. And as usual, our newer products grew at a faster rate from a smaller base.\n While some of our customers are continuing to be cost conscious, we are seeing optimization activity reduce in intensity. As an illustration, the optimizing cohort we identified several quarters ago did grow sequentially again this quarter. We also see that customers are adopting more products and increasing usage with us. We think this shows that they are moving forward with their cloud migration and digital transformation plans, and that we are executing on opportunities to consolidate point solutions into our platform.\n And finally, churn continues to be low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.\n Moving on to R&D. We had another very productive quarter. In the next-gen AI space, we announced general availability of Bits AI for incident management. By using Bits AI for incident management, incident responders get auto-generated incident summaries to quickly understand the context and scope of a complex incident. And users can also query Bits AI to ask about relative incidents and perform tasks on the fly from incident creation to resolution.\n We're also continuing to see more interest in AI from our customers. As a data point, ARR for our next-gen AI customers was about 3.5% of our total, a strong sign of the growing ecosystem of companies in this area.\n To help customers understand AI technologies and bring them into production applications, our AI integrations allow customers to put their AI data into the Datadog platform. And today, about 2,000 of our customers are using 1 or more of these AI integrations. And we've continued to keep up with the rapid innovation in this space. For example, adding a new integration in Q1 with the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.\n In the cloud service management area, we released Event Management in general availability. Our customers face increasing complexity at scale, causing the volume of alerts and events to explode, which makes it difficult for teams to identify, prioritize, summarize and route issue to the right responders. Event Management addresses this challenge by automatically reducing a massive volume of events and alerts into actionable insights. These are then used to generate tickets, call an incident or trigger an automated remediation.\n And by combining Event Management with Watchdog, Bits AI and Workflow Automations, Datadog now provides a full AIOps solution that helps teams automate remediation, proactively prevent outages and reduce the impact of incidents.\n In the observability space, our Log Management product continues to expand in capability. In March, we made error tracking for logs generally available. Error tracking intelligently combines millions of errors from logs into a manageable number of issues for customers. And beyond error tracking, we are delivering new features to allow our customers to do more with their logs within the Datadog platform, starting with new core capabilities such as enhanced full-text search and support for advanced subqueries, both highly desired by our customers.\n We also continue to make progress with Flex Logs. As a reminder, Flex Logs allow customers to easily scale storage and compute separately which in turn allows for new, very high-volume use cases in a cost-effective manner. While Flex Logs remains in limited availability, we are seeing a high level of interest from customers, many of whom want to retain logs for long-term purposes such as audit, security and compliance. And we're pleased to see that with only a limited set of customers so far, Flex Logs already exceed $10 million in ARR today.\n In the digital experience area, we launched mobile app testing in general availability, giving access to fast, no code, reliable testing on real mobile devices, which was a big challenge for customers given the wide range of devices and operating systems in use by consumers. And in Cloud Cost Management, we've added full support for Google Cloud, so FinOps and DevOps teams can optimize their cloud spend across their AWS, Azure and GCP footprint. Cloud Cost Management is another of our newer products that exceeds the $10 million ARR milestone, and we believe there's significantly more opportunity for us to have our customers there.\n As usual, I'd like to thank our product and engineering teams for the quarter, and I'm looking forward to the many announcements we'll make at our DASH user conference in late June, here in New York.\n Now let's move on to sales and marketing. We've been pleased to once again add some exciting new customers and expand with many more. So let's go through a few examples. First, we signed a 3-year, 7-figure expansion with a leading online grocery business. This customer has used Datadog as their platform of choice for several years now. And as they migrate to Azure, they are looking to ensure reliability and security as they deploy at scale. With this renewal, they are adding Cloud Security Management, Application Security Management and Cloud SIEM to enable a shift to a DevSecOps culture in the organization. And this customer expects to add 7 products for a total of 14 across the Datadog platform.\n Next, in 2 deals over the past 6 months, we had a 7-figure expansion with a medical device company. This customer was primarily using our infrastructure monitoring and APM suite, but its legacy logging solution was becoming cost prohibitive, while the lack of correlation across siloed teams was causing frustration and higher times to resolution. With this expansion, the customer plans to add up 9 products and consolidate its log management tool as well as 4 other commercial and cloud-native tools into Datadog.\n Next, we signed a high 6-figure expansion with an athletic apparel company. This company had a dozen disparate monitoring tools, which wasted time and was impacting operations, revenue and customer experience. With this expansion, the company plans to consolidate out of 4 commercial and open-source point solutions. They also expect to save millions of dollars over the next several years, while providing a great consumer experience.\n Next, we signed a high 6-figure expansion with a European division of 1 of the world's largest car makers. This customer has chosen Datadog as its observability vendor in many business units globally. And in Europe, they currently monitor about 1/4 of their applications with us and are migrating hundreds of applications to fully move to Datadog in the next 2 years. With this expansion, this customer is using [ Edge ] products in the Datadog platform.\n Next, we signed a 6-figure land with a division of a Fortune 500 industrial company. The company is moving its e-commerce application to Google Cloud. They felt that using on-prem monitoring tools would not transition well to the cloud and are starting with 3 of our products as they are confident in Datadog's ability to keep innovating in modern cloud and serverless environments.\n Finally, we signed a 6-figure land with 1 of the world's largest communication infrastructure companies. This company started cloud migration a couple of years ago and found itself limited by fragmented tooling and lack of data correlation. In contrast, the Datadog service catalog gives them a single view for performance, ownership, security, SLOs and KPIs, which customer believes is a unique capability among the vendors it considered, and which aligns with their goal of delivering centralized observability across the business. And this customer is adopting 7 Datadog products initially and consolidating out of 4 tools.\n And that's it for another productive quarter for [ mobile ] to market teams.\n Let me now say a few words on our longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change in the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We are seeing improved usage growth with less impact from optimization than we had seen in the last few quarters. For those customers who are remaining cost focused, we are very happy to help them get value from their observability solutions and consolidate into the Datadog platform to achieve time and cost savings.\n Meanwhile, we are seeing continued experimentation with new technologies, including a growing adoption of AI, which we believe will be an accelerator of technical innovation and cloud migration over time. And we're working every day to innovate and help our customers adopt new technologies with confidence and become better businesses in the process.\n With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David? \nDavid Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. Q1 revenue was $611 million, up 27% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q1 performance, first, regarding usage growth, in Q1, we saw sequential usage growth from existing customers that was higher than the usage growth in Q4. Q1's usage growth was similar to what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of 2022. And given this steep growth and off a larger base, our sequential ARR dollars added was the highest since Q4 2021. During Q1, we experienced a linearity pattern that was very typical for us, which included usage growth in March that was higher than January and February. \n Regarding usage growth by customer size in Q1, we saw usage growth accelerate across our larger customers, those with $100,000 of annual spend or higher. And we saw particularly strong usage growth with our largest customers who spend multiple millions of dollars with us annually. Geographically, we experienced stronger year-over-year revenue growth in international markets than in North America. And finally, for our retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue retention was in the mid-100s in Q1 -- sorry, in the mid-110s in Q1, similar to last quarter. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid- to high 90s.\n Now moving on to our financial results. Billings were $618 million, up 21% year-over-year. Billings duration increased year-over-year. Sequential billings growth was seasonally lower as it was in Q1 2023. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.73 billion, up 52% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the low 40% growth year-over-year. RPO duration increased year-over-year but was down quarter-over-quarter as we saw fewer multiyear deals relative to last quarter.\n In general, we are continuing to see an increasing interest with our larger customers in multiyear commitments, which results in longer RPO duration in both total and current RPO. As a reminder, our RPO has been and continues to be lumpy, an effect that may be amplified as our customers move towards multiyear deals.\n We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\n Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\n First, gross profit in the quarter was $509 million, representing a gross margin of 83.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 83.4% last quarter and 80.5% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency projects.\n Our Q1 OpEx grew 14% year-over-year and increased from 10% year-over-year growth last quarter. As discussed last quarter, we intend to invest in headcount in 2024, and we have accelerated hiring in sales and marketing and R&D to execute on our growth plans. Q1 operating income was $164 million, or a 27% operating margin compared to 28% last quarter and 18% in the year-ago quarter.\n And now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $212 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $187 million for a free cash flow margin of 31%.\n Now for our outlook for the second quarter and the fiscal year 2024. Our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends. So for the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $620 million to $624 million, which represents a 22% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $134 million to $138 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. In Q2, we will be holding our DASH user conference, which we estimate to cost about $11 million. Our operating income guidance reflects this event.\n Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.34 to $0.36 per share based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.61 billion, which represents 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $585 million to $605 million, which implies an operating margin of 23%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.51 to $1.57 per share based on approximately 361 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\n Now for some additional notes on our guidance. First, we expect net interest income and other income together for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $110 million. Next, we expect cash taxes in 2024 to be in the $20 million to $25 million range, and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward. And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 3% to 4% of revenues in fiscal 2024.\n To summarize, we are pleased with how we started 2024. And I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts. And now with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. \nSanjit Singh: It was encouraging to see that usage trends continue to improve, at least sequentially Q1 over Q4. I wanted to see if you could put like the usage trends you're seeing in your business in context of like the broader cloud landscape. And we're seeing some really nice results out of the hyperscalers. Obviously, there's -- those are much larger businesses and in different -- can be in different product areas. But when we think about the tailwinds of like cloud migrations and also AI workloads starting to come on board, how does that -- how is that playing out in Datadog's business versus what we may be seeing from like the hyperscales who are -- who seem to be accelerating to a higher degree? \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Sanjit, this is Olivier. So I think, in general, it's hard to be -- to do a precise quarter-by-quarter one-to-one mapping between the revenue and the cloud providers and our revenue. I think you pointed out, there are things in their products that don't relate to us directly or things in their internal revenue that don't relate to us directly. We have products that don't tie one-to-one with infrastructure on their end. But in general, over the longer term, we are very exposed to the growth trend you will see with the cloud providers, and the correlation you've seen in the past between our businesses, we expect will remain in some form in the future.\n We also are very exposed to the same tailwinds, obviously, cloud migration, but also AI adoption. I will say also on AI adoption that some of the revenue jumps you might see from the cloud providers might relate to supply of GPUs coming online and a lot of training clusters being provisioned. And those typically won't generate a lot of new usage for us. We tend to be more correlative with the live applications, production applications and inference workloads that tend to follow after that, and that are more tied to all of these applications going into production. So these are the things to factor. But overall, same trends, just not a one-to-one timing. \nSanjit Singh: That makes complete sense. And I was wondering if you had any comments on how usage trends coming out of March would seem to be stronger than in the beginning of Q1, how that sort of played out in April? \nDavid Obstler: Sure. Sanjit, it's David here. As we always say, we try to look into the next month, but that's a small-time set. In this case, the April trends continue to exhibit higher sequential growth rates than the year-ago quarter. But we caution everybody that 1 month does not a quarter make, and we'll continue to update that next quarter as we report. \nOlivier Pomel: And the seasonality in Q1 was very usual. Every year, there's a drop around the holidays in Q1 and January starts slowly, and then it accelerates into March, and we've seen that pretty much every year so far and we're seeing it this year as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. \nMark Murphy: Congratulations on the revenue acceleration during the quarter. Olivier, I'm wondering how commonly are customers in your gen AI cohort using Datadog to monitor for bias and hallucinations within their AI models as opposed to just keeping the systems running? And also, do you see more concentration of customers within that cohort? Or is there actually more diversity as more of the models move beyond the training stage and into the inferencing stage? \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So we have products for monitoring, not just the infrastructure, but what the LLMs are doing. Those products are still not in GA, so we're working with a smaller number of design partners for that. As I think not only these products are maturing, but also the industry around us is maturing and more of these applications are getting into production. You should expect to hear more from us on that topic in the near future.\n The customers we have that are the most scaled on AI workloads are the model providers themselves, and they tend to have their own infrastructure for monitoring the quality of the models. But we think there are good/bad weather in terms of what the adoption of AI is going to be from all the other companies, and we definitely see a trend where customers start with an API-driven or API-accessible model, build applications and then offload some of that application to other models that typically come from the open source and they might train, fine-tune themselves to get to a lower cost and lower time to respond. \nMark Murphy: I understand. Okay. And then, David, you had mentioned, I think, last quarter that the cloud-native spending had rebounded. It was outpacing the broader business. And just to clarify, are you saying that the traditional large enterprise business during Q1 you picked up in terms of the cloud migration activity as the hyperscalers might have suggested, was that -- I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment and whether there was something really noticeable, intangible there among the large enterprise, more traditional businesses? \nDavid Obstler: Yes, we saw -- as said, we saw growth accelerate in our larger customers including the larger cloud natives and enterprise. So we did see more normal activity, including new workloads in both of those cohorts. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of GS. \nKasthuri Rangan: Congratulations to the team on very good results here. Olivier, I was wondering if you could talk about the consolidation trend that you're talking about. It looks like the pace of consolidation and also, the intensity of lands and expense seems to be a bit more remarkable at the starting point of this [indiscernible]. So if you could expand on that a little bit.\n And one for you, David, our cRPO has been accelerating. I think at low 20s to 30s to 40s over the last few quarters. but revenue expectations have not edged up pretty significantly. So can you just talk about the lead lag effect, granted that you always try to tell us that revenue is best indicator but none the less it's hard to dismiss the cRPO acceleration we've seen off of -- in the last few quarters. \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So I'll let David speak about the cRPO dynamics, but the -- so look, we've seen over the couple of years really, but really the past few quarters, more consolidation than we've seen in the past, in part driven by customers wanting to -- being cost conscious, wanting to save money, but in part also by customers getting a little bit further into their cloud migration and rationalizing what they're using as they do that. So we keep seeing that. We've mentioned a number of those deals in the examples we've given. That's a large part of what our enterprise business is doing in particular. There's no particular change in Q1 compared to what we've seen in Q4 before. Q1 is -- we typically do a lot of larger deals in Q1 -- in Q4 compared to Q1, seasonally in general.\n To the point you made earlier, we do see typically a bit of a lag between these big consolidation deals and the moment where we see our revenue recognized. Typically, when we consolidate products, what we'll see is, we'll assume the ramp time for moving usage from other products to our platform over what can be a number of quarters or even years sometimes. And it might take some time for those deals to or those numbers to materialize in the revenue.\n On the flip side, we also have a number of deals where customers are growing very quickly into their usage, and we capture new commitments with them. That might lag a little bit their consumption and the revenue we recognize, so we see a little bit of both.\n David, do you want to speak a little bit more? \nDavid Obstler: Sure. Similar to what we said last time, we are seeing our customers, particularly our larger customers commit longer to us. That can be multiyear deals or even out towards -- the weighted average towards annual deals as opposed to shorter-term deals. So basically, it is a positive in that it does connote that clients are committing to Datadog more as their core platform. It is a trend that we're seeing, particularly in larger customers. But we repeat what we said that really how we contract, and bill is not necessarily one-to-one correlated with our revenues. Our revenues are correlated with our usage. So it's a positive, but I think that we want to keep everybody grounded on our revenues as the most important metric, and then secondarily, our ARR as predicting future revenue growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. \nRaimo Lenschow: Going back to the workload migration that seems to be kicking back in again from listening to the hyperscalers and you talked about the timing difference there. I wanted to kind of ask on a different aspect here and that's kind of your sales capacity and the ramp in sales capacity that we should think about it. Like can you speak about like where you are at the moment in terms of capacity? And then as the market reaccelerates, like what sort of investments should we think about there? \nOlivier Pomel: So we're growing sales capacity. We've been growing it for the past few years. We grew it a little bit slower -- more slowly last year as we were careful about profitability and not getting too far ahead of ourselves in what looked like a tough market, but we're definitely growing sales capacity. And there's a ramp model that is associated with that. So the capacity typically lags a little bit the growth in terms of headcount. It takes time for people to get productive. But we're investing. We're growing and... \nDavid Obstler: Long-term sales capacity is very much calibrated to revenue and UAR growth. As Oli mentioned, there are periods where it will move higher than that as we make investments, and there's periods where we might optimize. I think last year was a period where we digested previous investments, optimized a bit. And we said, this year, we're leaning into expansion of our sales capacity and investment. But long term, it correlates with revenue. And we look at that. We look at do we have enough sales capacity relative to what we see as the demand in the market, the territories and the expected ARR growth. \nOlivier Pomel: To give you just a -- kind of a bit more color, like one of the big areas of focus inside the company is ramping up recruiting again. So we're recruiting a lot faster, a lot more than we were last year. And so we had to rev up that recruiting engine again. I won't -- I think they're listening to us, I want to congratulate our business recruiting team there for doing a fantastic job, really bringing that engine back up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC. \nMatthew Hedberg: Oli, you mentioned newer products continue to do really, really well. You gave some interesting data on Database Monitoring, for instance. I'm wondering, are these newer products resonating up and down your customer base? Or are these -- some of these cross-sell statistics stronger with some of your bigger customers? \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So it really depends on the product. Some products are extremely broad based in terms of their appeal. And some others are really more directed to that -- certain types of customers. For example, all products that have to do with monitoring physical networks, they tend to be more appealing to larger, older enterprises because they are the ones with large physical footprint, whereas products like Cloud Cost Management, for example, or even Database Monitoring have very, very broad appeal because every single customer cares about their cloud cost. And every single customer is using databases that are at the center of their applications, and that are absolutely critical to understand.\n And we mentioned those products because really like we see that as our efforts paying off in terms of broadening the offering and investing in R&D. And these are green shoots that we expect to grow into the future. Some of those products, we have extremely high expectations for because they correspond to very large categories, which we can think can be very meaningful to the business in the long run. Some others are surprising us a little bit. That's why we mentioned Database Monitoring. We were not sure if it was going to be a huge category in cloud environment, but it turns out, not only is there a very big problem our customers need us to solve there, but also this product hit that problem on the head from day 1 really, and we expect -- now we expect a lot more from it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. \nFatima Boolani: David, you explicitly mentioned that the international book of business and activity was stronger than domestic. So I wanted to better understand some of the more intrinsic and maybe extrinsic dynamics that are driving that divergence in terms of [ geographically ] your performance? And if you could sort of help us understand if it's an end market, a product based or a budgetary based set of distinctions that would be very helpful. \nDavid Obstler: Yes. It's very similar to what we've been saying over time. The international markets have been more immature as to their cloud migrations and their deployment of digital applications than the North American markets, and we've been more immature in terms of our footprint. So we've talked about some examples in Investor Day and otherwise of places like Brazil and Korea to name just a couple, where we are seeing an increase of activity as well as an increase of our deployment of our capacity, which has resulted in an uptick of the international demand over time. \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. For us to be successful, there are two factors that are needed. So the first one is cloud adoption needs to happen because we can't outrun it really. And the second one is we need to deploy sales capacity and grow sales capacity, and that's really combination of the two. In most markets today, cloud adoption is happening. There still may be a few holdouts that are a little bit slower. And -- but we're not yet deploying enough sales capacity everywhere, and that's one of our big areas of focus, as I mentioned earlier. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. \nBrent Thill: David, good margins, 27%, but you're guiding full year to 23%. I know you mentioned you're stepping on the sales investments, but anything else that's coming into the investment mix this year that is different than we've seen in the past years to drive that margin lower throughout the year? \nDavid Obstler: Sales and R&D investment, we are -- we have both the sales capacity and the whole ecosystem that we've been talking about. And as Oli often says, we have more high-return product projects than we always have capacity and are attempting to make the appropriate investments. So it's really that we are layering in. We said all along that this can't be changed, headcount can't be changed as quickly as revenues. So we have periods where we're investing more than revenue growth or less. And this year is the one where we're coming from a more conservative posture of last year into more investment in both R&D and sales and marketing. There's nothing onetime or special. It relates to both sales capacity and R&D projects. Oli, anything else? \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. Again, I mean, I -- bringing it back to what I was saying earlier, a big focus internally is recruiting and making sure that we go fast enough there. I would say one more thing. Last year, when the market was slowing down, most of our peers have laid off their recruiting teams, and we didn't do that because we knew we need to -- our success will depend on revving the recruiting engine back up and growing the engineering and the sales team fast enough for us to go after the gen AI market opportunity we have. So we are very happy we haven't done that, but we still have a lot of work to do to recruit enough of the right people fast enough. \nDavid Obstler: I'd add as we always have said that we have a very efficient, scalable business, and we control the pace of our investments. And we -- at the same time, that we're investing, we've been investing in efficiency projects, like we talked about in the cloud to balance those things to deliver a strong profitability posture with strong investment. \nBrent Thill: David, can I just ask a quick clarification on commitment overage and usage. I think you had a roughly 75%, 25% split across commit coverage and usage. Is that still in the same ballpark? \nDavid Obstler: Yes. I think we said it's been in the range of sort of upper teens to mid-20s over time. But that type of posture of clients under-committing and evolving into their usage hasn't changed over time. So that is still in the range that we've talked about since we went public. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge of William Blair. \nJacob Roberge: Great to hear that AI-native customers represented 3.5% of ARR. I'm curious on what you're seeing on the demand front for your own AI products like AIOps and cloud service management? And then you mentioned that the model providers have built their own tools to monitor the training of their models. As you start to roll out your own LLM observability solutions, do you see that trend changing? And is that something that customers have been asking you to build? \nOlivier Pomel: So on the first question, so we -- so look, we see a lot of interest in the new products. These are new products so we just announced in GA, the Event Management product, which is the main missing building block we had for AIOps platform. And we also just released into GA, Bits for incident management. So there's a lot of demand for it. The products are actually, I will say it, for Bits for incident management is a joy to use. So that's great. But you should also expect to hear more from us on that topic in the next 12 months. So this is all very exciting.\n On the tooling, I would say there's a handful of players that have been building that tooling for a few years for -- in a way that's very specialized to what they do internally. They are not necessarily the representative of the bulk of the market. So in those situations, we're always careful about overfitting products to a group that might not be the right target customer group in the end in the same way that building infrastructure monitoring for the cloud providers to use internally might not be an exact fit for what the rest of the world needs.\n That being said, I mean, look, we work a lot with those companies, and they have a number of needs that some of them they can meet internally and some of them, they don't. And if I go back to the example of hyperscalers, we actually have teams at the hyperscalers that use us for application or infrastructure or logs internally, even though they've built a lot of that tooling themselves. So I think everything is possible in the long run. But our focus is really on the vast majority of the customer base that's going to either use those API-based products or tune and run their own models. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS. \nKarl Keirstead: Great. Maybe to Olivier. Could you give a little context to the President stepping down into the Board, he's obviously been there a long time and has been a big part of the Datadog story.\n And then for David, you've done a great job over the years dissuading us from over-indexing on DR and billings. But as you actually pointed out, the sequential decline in DR and billings was quite a bit larger than normal. I'm just curious if there's a story there? \nOlivier Pomel: So I'll start with Amit, our President. So Amit wanted to stop working as a full-time operator but wants to stay close to the company and we want to stay close to him, too. I mean, he's been, as you pointed out, a big part of the Datadog story, and we definitely want to keep him involved in the company and keep working with him.\n So the plan is for him to join the Board. You should expect him to maybe reappear at some point as a VC investor, something that's less operational than what he's doing today. And we expect him to be a part of the company for the future as well. I've always said, I will miss him every day in the office.\n David, do you want to comment on the... \nDavid Obstler: Yes. Now to the more mundane topic of billings. So yes, I think that we did see a decel. We had a very strong Q4 in terms of commitments to us, which manifests itself in billings. We talked about the larger customers committing to multiyear deals and committing to us. We do have a sequential factor, not in our revenues, which are based on usage as must, but basically in our billings and operations like that, usually in Q1 as clients sort of commit. So in some ways, we don't have the seasonality to speak of in the revenues, but like we talked about in billings and RPO, we do have variations in billings.\n We're not reading that much into it. In that -- overall weighted, it's going to vary, and we point everyone back towards ARR and revenues, but acknowledge that, that seasonality may have been a little more pronounced in this cycle than in the previous one. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. \nBrad Reback: Oli, one of the fastest ways to recruit quickly is via larger acquisitions. So maybe you can give us your thoughts on potentially going a little bigger here given that you're generating close to $1 billion of OCF a year right now? \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So look, everything is on the table for us. Like we're very busy on the M&A side. We have a team that is, at any point in time, reviewing multiple deals. And everything is possible. I would say the larger the acquisition, the less likely it is to happen because we're extremely selective in terms of, not only the economics of any deal, but also the fit and whether we think it's truly going to accelerate us in the mid- to long term. But everything is possible.\n We are very fortunate to have a very efficient business. As we pointed, they're generating quite a bit of cash now, and that opens a number of doors for us, and we fully intend to use that if we have the right opportunity. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda of Bank of America Securities. \nKoji Ikeda: I wanted to ask a question on AI. You mentioned in the prepared remarks about 3.5% of ARR, last quarter about 3%. So it looks like the trend is about plus 50 basis points a quarter right now. So really great to see the ongoing expansion there. So from a big-picture perspective, in your view, what needs to happen for this metric to start expanding, say, 1, 2, 3 points a quarter? \nOlivier Pomel: I mean, look, it's -- so first of all, I'm not sure this is a metric we'll keep bringing up. It was interesting for us to look at this small group of early AI-native companies to get a sense of what might come next in the world of AI. But I think as we -- as time goes by and as AI adoption broadens, I think it becomes less and less relevant.\n But the one thing I will say is, we -- so we try to compare our exposure to AI to what we see from the hyperscalers because they are upstream from us in that respect. The hyperscaler that is the most open by is -- or transparent by in terms of numbers is Microsoft as they disclose how much of their growth comes from AI more specifically. And I will say that if you compare our business to theirs, the Azure part of our business is growing faster than Azure itself. And the AI-driven part of our Azure business itself is also growing faster than what you see on the on the overall Azure number. So we think we have similar exposure, and we track to the same trends broadly.\n The other cloud providers are not as forthcoming with metrics so it's harder to do a direct comparison. But in the longer term, we expect the same trends to apply. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter M. Weed of Bernstein. \nPeter Weed: One of the things that jumped out at me is you saw some improvement in net new customer adds quarter-over-quarter kind of for the first time maybe over the last year or so, which is pretty exciting. Obviously, I know there's a long tail effect with this. But as you look at that, do you see that as kind of a reflection of momentum in kind of the larger enterprise or a rebound in kind of the digital native venture-backed community, perhaps from that broadened AI. And if you think about pipeline going forward, should we anticipate kind of this bottoming and strength to continue and maybe accelerate? \nOlivier Pomel: So I mean, yes, the number of customers going up faster than it was the past few quarters. I would say it's hard to read too much into it because we have a large number of smaller customers. And there's more variability into the number of those smaller customers we get, and we lose at any point in time and without really having a very large impact on the business. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I will say that the trends are -- all in customer acquisitions and retention are good.\n Another number we reported on, which I think is worth mentioning is we saw also a higher number of customers above $100,000, cross that mark, basically cross that mark of $100,000 in revenue. And that's a return to the mean of what we had seen before, I think last quarter that number was a little bit lower. And it really shows what we were saying last quarter, which is that customers are growing on that revenue curve. And sometimes, there are little peaks and valleys in that, in the distribution of customers across the revenue curve for us. But overall, the motion is still the same. Customers are landing with us small and they're growing and they're getting bigger. And as a result, we're getting a larger and larger number of customers above $100,000 and above $1 million and are driving the major ratio of our revenue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. \nEric Heath: Oli, in your prepared remarks, I don't think you talked too much on security and just given we're out here at RSA this week. I was curious if you could talk about traction you're seeing there. And then maybe any feedback on adoption trends following the new packaging you rolled out a couple of quarters ago? \nOlivier Pomel: Yes. So the -- so far, the news are pretty good on the -- these new packages. Again, we want to wait to have seen them in the market for a few quarters before we comment too much on those, but the uptake is good. They seem to resonate well with customers, response to the right need, and they're fairly easy to insert into the sales process. So all that are good news so far.\n I realize we didn't put too much in the script on security. We actually have a few things coming out. As there's RSA this week in San Francisco and our team is there to meet with customers. One of the new piece of functionality we've announced last week was the agentless scanning for cloud security products, which we think is going to help a lot of customers deploy our product much more broadly, much more quickly. So we're very excited about that. It's in beta right now.\n And yes, overall, the same trends we commented on last quarter are still true, thousands of customers [ building ] on security, revenue growth, growth on a number of different pillars at the same time, which is very exciting and really speaks to our platform approach for security as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. \nAndrew Nowinski: I had a question on guidance for Q2. You had strong net new ARR in Q1. And you said you're seeing improved usage growth and less optimization. But based on your Q2 revenue guidance, it looks like you're assuming net new ARR in Q2 declines pretty significantly. I guess did you have some deals that pulled into Q1? And if not, why would net new ARR in Q2 be down year-over-year? \nDavid Obstler: No. I mean, we -- it's the same thing that we've said in every quarter that our guidance is taking the trends both in terms of usage growth and new business accumulation and it discounts them. And that's exactly the same as we said since we've been a public company. So that's what we do in providing the guidance and continue to do that in this quarter. \nAndrew Nowinski: All right, and I'm wondering if you're seeing any sort of uptick in consolidation in the log management and SIEM markets given the M&A activity in that space? \nOlivier Pomel: Yes, there are definitely opportunities there. And so we spoke on the, I think, in the script on the -- about some of the advanced query functionalities, we're adding to logs. We spoke about Flex Logs. So those are all geared towards going after this opportunity. And we think also there's more specifically an opportunity around SIEM workloads, which is why we are investing heavily in our Cloud SIEM product. And so we think there's definitely a lot of opportunities there, and the teams are very focused on that.\n I don't expect these opportunities to make a big dent in our numbers in the next couple of quarters. But in the next year or so, definitely, we expect to see more. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham. \nMichael Cikos: Just one topic, a bit of a 2-parter here, but I think in the prepared remarks, management incited improving trends for the number of or the cohort of customers who are moving past optimization sequentially. So I guess the question is really, can you help us think about the rate or pace of customers that are moving into this cohort, is the first piece of the question.\n And then the second piece, what kind of assumptions do you have for sustained improvement or additional customers entering that cohort as we think about the guidance that we have here today. I'm wondering how much needs to happen on that front for you guys to get more comfortable with the guidance? Or are you guys assuming steady state here and anything else is kind of really just upside? \nDavid Obstler: Yes. No, we said that we don't provide guidance on the percentage of customers that are in this cohort. We just are commenting that the trends that we mentioned last quarter of the abatement of optimization in this cohort manifested itself again, and they continue to grow. Like always, our guidance takes conservative assumptions and looks across the trends in the business and assumes that there would be more conservative drivers of the business than we've had in the last quarters. So we continue with that methodology. \nOlivier Pomel: And look, we mentioned that cohort because we thought it was a bad weather, right? We thought they were the first to really optimize and they felt they exhibited all the highest need, I would say, for a quick turnaround on their own financial profile, but there are other pockets of optimization in the business. There are other customers that are going through that later. There are customers that are still going through it. It's an ongoing -- it's going to be an ongoing phenomenon. It's been throughout the history of the company. So as we get further and further from the macro situation last year -- from last year, I think this cohort will lose in relevance in terms of its -- what we can read into it for the rest of the business. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to CEO, Olivier Pomel for closing remarks. \nOlivier Pomel: All right. Thank you. So again, I want to thank the whole team for what was a great quarter. And I know many of our customers and users are listening to the earnings call. So I want to make sure everybody knows we're having our DASH Conference in June in New York. You can go to dashcon.io, and we really look forward to seeing you there. So thank you all. \nDavid Obstler: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Olivier Pomel",
            "content": "Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution at the start of 2024. First, we have continued to broaden our platform across observability, cloud security, software delivery as well as closing the loop with cloud service management. We also kept supporting our customers' adoption of new technologies including next-gen AI and large language models. And we have continued to add new customers and to see existing customers increase their usage growth and product adoption.\n Let me start with a review of our Q1 financial performance. Revenue was $611 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 28,000 customers, up from about 25,500 last year. We had about 3,340 customers, with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,910 last year. These customers generated about 87% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $187 million, with a free cash flow margin of 31%.\n Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 82% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 81% a year ago. 47% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 43% a year ago. 23% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 19% a year ago. And 10% of our customers were using 8 or more products, up from 7% last year.\n We continue to see robust growth in our 3 pillars of observability: Infrastructure monitoring, APM and log management. But we also have many younger products that are becoming more meaningful contributors to our business over time. For example, our products outside of infrastructure monitoring, APM suite and Log Management exceeded $200 million in ARR in Q1. And as a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, Synthetics, RUM and Continuous Profiler. And as we look at the 12 products that we launched between 2020 and 2022, those now contribute about 11% to our ARR.\n Of those 12 products, 8 are over $10 million in ARR, which is a nice milestone for these relatively new additions. And we are seeing some products grow faster than we initially expected. For example, Database Monitoring is already 1% of our revenue with strong and growing product penetration across our customer base. So we are very pleased with the progress of our newer products, even though we know we have much further to go with them.\n Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q1, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than in Q4. And this usage growth in Q1 was similar to what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of 2022. As a reminder, that was a period when we started to see a normalization of usage following the accelerated growth we had experienced in 2021. Overall, we saw healthy growth across our product lines. And as usual, our newer products grew at a faster rate from a smaller base.\n While some of our customers are continuing to be cost conscious, we are seeing optimization activity reduce in intensity. As an illustration, the optimizing cohort we identified several quarters ago did grow sequentially again this quarter. We also see that customers are adopting more products and increasing usage with us. We think this shows that they are moving forward with their cloud migration and digital transformation plans, and that we are executing on opportunities to consolidate point solutions into our platform.\n And finally, churn continues to be low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.\n Moving on to R&D. We had another very productive quarter. In the next-gen AI space, we announced general availability of Bits AI for incident management. By using Bits AI for incident management, incident responders get auto-generated incident summaries to quickly understand the context and scope of a complex incident. And users can also query Bits AI to ask about relative incidents and perform tasks on the fly from incident creation to resolution.\n We're also continuing to see more interest in AI from our customers. As a data point, ARR for our next-gen AI customers was about 3.5% of our total, a strong sign of the growing ecosystem of companies in this area.\n To help customers understand AI technologies and bring them into production applications, our AI integrations allow customers to put their AI data into the Datadog platform. And today, about 2,000 of our customers are using 1 or more of these AI integrations. And we've continued to keep up with the rapid innovation in this space. For example, adding a new integration in Q1 with the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.\n In the cloud service management area, we released Event Management in general availability. Our customers face increasing complexity at scale, causing the volume of alerts and events to explode, which makes it difficult for teams to identify, prioritize, summarize and route issue to the right responders. Event Management addresses this challenge by automatically reducing a massive volume of events and alerts into actionable insights. These are then used to generate tickets, call an incident or trigger an automated remediation.\n And by combining Event Management with Watchdog, Bits AI and Workflow Automations, Datadog now provides a full AIOps solution that helps teams automate remediation, proactively prevent outages and reduce the impact of incidents.\n In the observability space, our Log Management product continues to expand in capability. In March, we made error tracking for logs generally available. Error tracking intelligently combines millions of errors from logs into a manageable number of issues for customers. And beyond error tracking, we are delivering new features to allow our customers to do more with their logs within the Datadog platform, starting with new core capabilities such as enhanced full-text search and support for advanced subqueries, both highly desired by our customers.\n We also continue to make progress with Flex Logs. As a reminder, Flex Logs allow customers to easily scale storage and compute separately which in turn allows for new, very high-volume use cases in a cost-effective manner. While Flex Logs remains in limited availability, we are seeing a high level of interest from customers, many of whom want to retain logs for long-term purposes such as audit, security and compliance. And we're pleased to see that with only a limited set of customers so far, Flex Logs already exceed $10 million in ARR today.\n In the digital experience area, we launched mobile app testing in general availability, giving access to fast, no code, reliable testing on real mobile devices, which was a big challenge for customers given the wide range of devices and operating systems in use by consumers. And in Cloud Cost Management, we've added full support for Google Cloud, so FinOps and DevOps teams can optimize their cloud spend across their AWS, Azure and GCP footprint. Cloud Cost Management is another of our newer products that exceeds the $10 million ARR milestone, and we believe there's significantly more opportunity for us to have our customers there.\n As usual, I'd like to thank our product and engineering teams for the quarter, and I'm looking forward to the many announcements we'll make at our DASH user conference in late June, here in New York.\n Now let's move on to sales and marketing. We've been pleased to once again add some exciting new customers and expand with many more. So let's go through a few examples. First, we signed a 3-year, 7-figure expansion with a leading online grocery business. This customer has used Datadog as their platform of choice for several years now. And as they migrate to Azure, they are looking to ensure reliability and security as they deploy at scale. With this renewal, they are adding Cloud Security Management, Application Security Management and Cloud SIEM to enable a shift to a DevSecOps culture in the organization. And this customer expects to add 7 products for a total of 14 across the Datadog platform.\n Next, in 2 deals over the past 6 months, we had a 7-figure expansion with a medical device company. This customer was primarily using our infrastructure monitoring and APM suite, but its legacy logging solution was becoming cost prohibitive, while the lack of correlation across siloed teams was causing frustration and higher times to resolution. With this expansion, the customer plans to add up 9 products and consolidate its log management tool as well as 4 other commercial and cloud-native tools into Datadog.\n Next, we signed a high 6-figure expansion with an athletic apparel company. This company had a dozen disparate monitoring tools, which wasted time and was impacting operations, revenue and customer experience. With this expansion, the company plans to consolidate out of 4 commercial and open-source point solutions. They also expect to save millions of dollars over the next several years, while providing a great consumer experience.\n Next, we signed a high 6-figure expansion with a European division of 1 of the world's largest car makers. This customer has chosen Datadog as its observability vendor in many business units globally. And in Europe, they currently monitor about 1/4 of their applications with us and are migrating hundreds of applications to fully move to Datadog in the next 2 years. With this expansion, this customer is using [ Edge ] products in the Datadog platform.\n Next, we signed a 6-figure land with a division of a Fortune 500 industrial company. The company is moving its e-commerce application to Google Cloud. They felt that using on-prem monitoring tools would not transition well to the cloud and are starting with 3 of our products as they are confident in Datadog's ability to keep innovating in modern cloud and serverless environments.\n Finally, we signed a 6-figure land with 1 of the world's largest communication infrastructure companies. This company started cloud migration a couple of years ago and found itself limited by fragmented tooling and lack of data correlation. In contrast, the Datadog service catalog gives them a single view for performance, ownership, security, SLOs and KPIs, which customer believes is a unique capability among the vendors it considered, and which aligns with their goal of delivering centralized observability across the business. And this customer is adopting 7 Datadog products initially and consolidating out of 4 tools.\n And that's it for another productive quarter for [ mobile ] to market teams.\n Let me now say a few words on our longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change in the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We are seeing improved usage growth with less impact from optimization than we had seen in the last few quarters. For those customers who are remaining cost focused, we are very happy to help them get value from their observability solutions and consolidate into the Datadog platform to achieve time and cost savings.\n Meanwhile, we are seeing continued experimentation with new technologies, including a growing adoption of AI, which we believe will be an accelerator of technical innovation and cloud migration over time. And we're working every day to innovate and help our customers adopt new technologies with confidence and become better businesses in the process.\n With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David? Yes. Sanjit, this is Olivier. So I think, in general, it's hard to be -- to do a precise quarter-by-quarter one-to-one mapping between the revenue and the cloud providers and our revenue. I think you pointed out, there are things in their products that don't relate to us directly or things in their internal revenue that don't relate to us directly. We have products that don't tie one-to-one with infrastructure on their end. But in general, over the longer term, we are very exposed to the growth trend you will see with the cloud providers, and the correlation you've seen in the past between our businesses, we expect will remain in some form in the future.\n We also are very exposed to the same tailwinds, obviously, cloud migration, but also AI adoption. I will say also on AI adoption that some of the revenue jumps you might see from the cloud providers might relate to supply of GPUs coming online and a lot of training clusters being provisioned. And those typically won't generate a lot of new usage for us. We tend to be more correlative with the live applications, production applications and inference workloads that tend to follow after that, and that are more tied to all of these applications going into production. So these are the things to factor. But overall, same trends, just not a one-to-one timing. And the seasonality in Q1 was very usual. Every year, there's a drop around the holidays in Q1 and January starts slowly, and then it accelerates into March, and we've seen that pretty much every year so far and we're seeing it this year as well. Yes. So we have products for monitoring, not just the infrastructure, but what the LLMs are doing. Those products are still not in GA, so we're working with a smaller number of design partners for that. As I think not only these products are maturing, but also the industry around us is maturing and more of these applications are getting into production. You should expect to hear more from us on that topic in the near future.\n The customers we have that are the most scaled on AI workloads are the model providers themselves, and they tend to have their own infrastructure for monitoring the quality of the models. But we think there are good/bad weather in terms of what the adoption of AI is going to be from all the other companies, and we definitely see a trend where customers start with an API-driven or API-accessible model, build applications and then offload some of that application to other models that typically come from the open source and they might train, fine-tune themselves to get to a lower cost and lower time to respond. Yes. So I'll let David speak about the cRPO dynamics, but the -- so look, we've seen over the couple of years really, but really the past few quarters, more consolidation than we've seen in the past, in part driven by customers wanting to -- being cost conscious, wanting to save money, but in part also by customers getting a little bit further into their cloud migration and rationalizing what they're using as they do that. So we keep seeing that. We've mentioned a number of those deals in the examples we've given. That's a large part of what our enterprise business is doing in particular. There's no particular change in Q1 compared to what we've seen in Q4 before. Q1 is -- we typically do a lot of larger deals in Q1 -- in Q4 compared to Q1, seasonally in general.\n To the point you made earlier, we do see typically a bit of a lag between these big consolidation deals and the moment where we see our revenue recognized. Typically, when we consolidate products, what we'll see is, we'll assume the ramp time for moving usage from other products to our platform over what can be a number of quarters or even years sometimes. And it might take some time for those deals to or those numbers to materialize in the revenue.\n On the flip side, we also have a number of deals where customers are growing very quickly into their usage, and we capture new commitments with them. That might lag a little bit their consumption and the revenue we recognize, so we see a little bit of both.\n David, do you want to speak a little bit more? So we're growing sales capacity. We've been growing it for the past few years. We grew it a little bit slower -- more slowly last year as we were careful about profitability and not getting too far ahead of ourselves in what looked like a tough market, but we're definitely growing sales capacity. And there's a ramp model that is associated with that. So the capacity typically lags a little bit the growth in terms of headcount. It takes time for people to get productive. But we're investing. We're growing and... To give you just a -- kind of a bit more color, like one of the big areas of focus inside the company is ramping up recruiting again. So we're recruiting a lot faster, a lot more than we were last year. And so we had to rev up that recruiting engine again. I won't -- I think they're listening to us, I want to congratulate our business recruiting team there for doing a fantastic job, really bringing that engine back up. Yes. So it really depends on the product. Some products are extremely broad based in terms of their appeal. And some others are really more directed to that -- certain types of customers. For example, all products that have to do with monitoring physical networks, they tend to be more appealing to larger, older enterprises because they are the ones with large physical footprint, whereas products like Cloud Cost Management, for example, or even Database Monitoring have very, very broad appeal because every single customer cares about their cloud cost. And every single customer is using databases that are at the center of their applications, and that are absolutely critical to understand.\n And we mentioned those products because really like we see that as our efforts paying off in terms of broadening the offering and investing in R&D. And these are green shoots that we expect to grow into the future. Some of those products, we have extremely high expectations for because they correspond to very large categories, which we can think can be very meaningful to the business in the long run. Some others are surprising us a little bit. That's why we mentioned Database Monitoring. We were not sure if it was going to be a huge category in cloud environment, but it turns out, not only is there a very big problem our customers need us to solve there, but also this product hit that problem on the head from day 1 really, and we expect -- now we expect a lot more from it. Yes. For us to be successful, there are two factors that are needed. So the first one is cloud adoption needs to happen because we can't outrun it really. And the second one is we need to deploy sales capacity and grow sales capacity, and that's really combination of the two. In most markets today, cloud adoption is happening. There still may be a few holdouts that are a little bit slower. And -- but we're not yet deploying enough sales capacity everywhere, and that's one of our big areas of focus, as I mentioned earlier. Yes. Again, I mean, I -- bringing it back to what I was saying earlier, a big focus internally is recruiting and making sure that we go fast enough there. I would say one more thing. Last year, when the market was slowing down, most of our peers have laid off their recruiting teams, and we didn't do that because we knew we need to -- our success will depend on revving the recruiting engine back up and growing the engineering and the sales team fast enough for us to go after the gen AI market opportunity we have. So we are very happy we haven't done that, but we still have a lot of work to do to recruit enough of the right people fast enough. So on the first question, so we -- so look, we see a lot of interest in the new products. These are new products so we just announced in GA, the Event Management product, which is the main missing building block we had for AIOps platform. And we also just released into GA, Bits for incident management. So there's a lot of demand for it. The products are actually, I will say it, for Bits for incident management is a joy to use. So that's great. But you should also expect to hear more from us on that topic in the next 12 months. So this is all very exciting.\n On the tooling, I would say there's a handful of players that have been building that tooling for a few years for -- in a way that's very specialized to what they do internally. They are not necessarily the representative of the bulk of the market. So in those situations, we're always careful about overfitting products to a group that might not be the right target customer group in the end in the same way that building infrastructure monitoring for the cloud providers to use internally might not be an exact fit for what the rest of the world needs.\n That being said, I mean, look, we work a lot with those companies, and they have a number of needs that some of them they can meet internally and some of them, they don't. And if I go back to the example of hyperscalers, we actually have teams at the hyperscalers that use us for application or infrastructure or logs internally, even though they've built a lot of that tooling themselves. So I think everything is possible in the long run. But our focus is really on the vast majority of the customer base that's going to either use those API-based products or tune and run their own models. So I'll start with Amit, our President. So Amit wanted to stop working as a full-time operator but wants to stay close to the company and we want to stay close to him, too. I mean, he's been, as you pointed out, a big part of the Datadog story, and we definitely want to keep him involved in the company and keep working with him.\n So the plan is for him to join the Board. You should expect him to maybe reappear at some point as a VC investor, something that's less operational than what he's doing today. And we expect him to be a part of the company for the future as well. I've always said, I will miss him every day in the office.\n David, do you want to comment on the... Yes. So look, everything is on the table for us. Like we're very busy on the M&A side. We have a team that is, at any point in time, reviewing multiple deals. And everything is possible. I would say the larger the acquisition, the less likely it is to happen because we're extremely selective in terms of, not only the economics of any deal, but also the fit and whether we think it's truly going to accelerate us in the mid- to long term. But everything is possible.\n We are very fortunate to have a very efficient business. As we pointed, they're generating quite a bit of cash now, and that opens a number of doors for us, and we fully intend to use that if we have the right opportunity. I mean, look, it's -- so first of all, I'm not sure this is a metric we'll keep bringing up. It was interesting for us to look at this small group of early AI-native companies to get a sense of what might come next in the world of AI. But I think as we -- as time goes by and as AI adoption broadens, I think it becomes less and less relevant.\n But the one thing I will say is, we -- so we try to compare our exposure to AI to what we see from the hyperscalers because they are upstream from us in that respect. The hyperscaler that is the most open by is -- or transparent by in terms of numbers is Microsoft as they disclose how much of their growth comes from AI more specifically. And I will say that if you compare our business to theirs, the Azure part of our business is growing faster than Azure itself. And the AI-driven part of our Azure business itself is also growing faster than what you see on the on the overall Azure number. So we think we have similar exposure, and we track to the same trends broadly.\n The other cloud providers are not as forthcoming with metrics so it's harder to do a direct comparison. But in the longer term, we expect the same trends to apply. So I mean, yes, the number of customers going up faster than it was the past few quarters. I would say it's hard to read too much into it because we have a large number of smaller customers. And there's more variability into the number of those smaller customers we get, and we lose at any point in time and without really having a very large impact on the business. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I will say that the trends are -- all in customer acquisitions and retention are good.\n Another number we reported on, which I think is worth mentioning is we saw also a higher number of customers above $100,000, cross that mark, basically cross that mark of $100,000 in revenue. And that's a return to the mean of what we had seen before, I think last quarter that number was a little bit lower. And it really shows what we were saying last quarter, which is that customers are growing on that revenue curve. And sometimes, there are little peaks and valleys in that, in the distribution of customers across the revenue curve for us. But overall, the motion is still the same. Customers are landing with us small and they're growing and they're getting bigger. And as a result, we're getting a larger and larger number of customers above $100,000 and above $1 million and are driving the major ratio of our revenue. Yes. So the -- so far, the news are pretty good on the -- these new packages. Again, we want to wait to have seen them in the market for a few quarters before we comment too much on those, but the uptake is good. They seem to resonate well with customers, response to the right need, and they're fairly easy to insert into the sales process. So all that are good news so far.\n I realize we didn't put too much in the script on security. We actually have a few things coming out. As there's RSA this week in San Francisco and our team is there to meet with customers. One of the new piece of functionality we've announced last week was the agentless scanning for cloud security products, which we think is going to help a lot of customers deploy our product much more broadly, much more quickly. So we're very excited about that. It's in beta right now.\n And yes, overall, the same trends we commented on last quarter are still true, thousands of customers [ building ] on security, revenue growth, growth on a number of different pillars at the same time, which is very exciting and really speaks to our platform approach for security as well. Yes, there are definitely opportunities there. And so we spoke on the, I think, in the script on the -- about some of the advanced query functionalities, we're adding to logs. We spoke about Flex Logs. So those are all geared towards going after this opportunity. And we think also there's more specifically an opportunity around SIEM workloads, which is why we are investing heavily in our Cloud SIEM product. And so we think there's definitely a lot of opportunities there, and the teams are very focused on that.\n I don't expect these opportunities to make a big dent in our numbers in the next couple of quarters. But in the next year or so, definitely, we expect to see more. And look, we mentioned that cohort because we thought it was a bad weather, right? We thought they were the first to really optimize and they felt they exhibited all the highest need, I would say, for a quick turnaround on their own financial profile, but there are other pockets of optimization in the business. There are other customers that are going through that later. There are customers that are still going through it. It's an ongoing -- it's going to be an ongoing phenomenon. It's been throughout the history of the company. So as we get further and further from the macro situation last year -- from last year, I think this cohort will lose in relevance in terms of its -- what we can read into it for the rest of the business. All right. Thank you. So again, I want to thank the whole team for what was a great quarter. And I know many of our customers and users are listening to the earnings call. So I want to make sure everybody knows we're having our DASH Conference in June in New York. You can go to dashcon.io, and we really look forward to seeing you there. So thank you all."

            "content": "Thanks, Olivier. Q1 revenue was $611 million, up 27% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q1 performance, first, regarding usage growth, in Q1, we saw sequential usage growth from existing customers that was higher than the usage growth in Q4. Q1's usage growth was similar to what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of 2022. And given this steep growth and off a larger base, our sequential ARR dollars added was the highest since Q4 2021. During Q1, we experienced a linearity pattern that was very typical for us, which included usage growth in March that was higher than January and February. \n Regarding usage growth by customer size in Q1, we saw usage growth accelerate across our larger customers, those with $100,000 of annual spend or higher. And we saw particularly strong usage growth with our largest customers who spend multiple millions of dollars with us annually. Geographically, we experienced stronger year-over-year revenue growth in international markets than in North America. And finally, for our retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue retention was in the mid-100s in Q1 -- sorry, in the mid-110s in Q1, similar to last quarter. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid- to high 90s.\n Now moving on to our financial results. Billings were $618 million, up 21% year-over-year. Billings duration increased year-over-year. Sequential billings growth was seasonally lower as it was in Q1 2023. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.73 billion, up 52% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the low 40% growth year-over-year. RPO duration increased year-over-year but was down quarter-over-quarter as we saw fewer multiyear deals relative to last quarter.\n In general, we are continuing to see an increasing interest with our larger customers in multiyear commitments, which results in longer RPO duration in both total and current RPO. As a reminder, our RPO has been and continues to be lumpy, an effect that may be amplified as our customers move towards multiyear deals.\n We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\n Now let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\n First, gross profit in the quarter was $509 million, representing a gross margin of 83.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 83.4% last quarter and 80.5% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency projects.\n Our Q1 OpEx grew 14% year-over-year and increased from 10% year-over-year growth last quarter. As discussed last quarter, we intend to invest in headcount in 2024, and we have accelerated hiring in sales and marketing and R&D to execute on our growth plans. Q1 operating income was $164 million, or a 27% operating margin compared to 28% last quarter and 18% in the year-ago quarter.\n And now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $212 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $187 million for a free cash flow margin of 31%.\n Now for our outlook for the second quarter and the fiscal year 2024. Our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends. So for the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $620 million to $624 million, which represents a 22% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $134 million to $138 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. In Q2, we will be holding our DASH user conference, which we estimate to cost about $11 million. Our operating income guidance reflects this event.\n Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.34 to $0.36 per share based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.61 billion, which represents 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $585 million to $605 million, which implies an operating margin of 23%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.51 to $1.57 per share based on approximately 361 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\n Now for some additional notes on our guidance. First, we expect net interest income and other income together for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $110 million. Next, we expect cash taxes in 2024 to be in the $20 million to $25 million range, and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward. And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 3% to 4% of revenues in fiscal 2024.\n To summarize, we are pleased with how we started 2024. And I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts. And now with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Sure. Sanjit, it's David here. As we always say, we try to look into the next month, but that's a small-time set. In this case, the April trends continue to exhibit higher sequential growth rates than the year-ago quarter. But we caution everybody that 1 month does not a quarter make, and we'll continue to update that next quarter as we report. Yes, we saw -- as said, we saw growth accelerate in our larger customers including the larger cloud natives and enterprise. So we did see more normal activity, including new workloads in both of those cohorts. Sure. Similar to what we said last time, we are seeing our customers, particularly our larger customers commit longer to us. That can be multiyear deals or even out towards -- the weighted average towards annual deals as opposed to shorter-term deals. So basically, it is a positive in that it does connote that clients are committing to Datadog more as their core platform. It is a trend that we're seeing, particularly in larger customers. But we repeat what we said that really how we contract, and bill is not necessarily one-to-one correlated with our revenues. Our revenues are correlated with our usage. So it's a positive, but I think that we want to keep everybody grounded on our revenues as the most important metric, and then secondarily, our ARR as predicting future revenue growth. Long-term sales capacity is very much calibrated to revenue and UAR growth. As Oli mentioned, there are periods where it will move higher than that as we make investments, and there's periods where we might optimize. I think last year was a period where we digested previous investments, optimized a bit. And we said, this year, we're leaning into expansion of our sales capacity and investment. But long term, it correlates with revenue. And we look at that. We look at do we have enough sales capacity relative to what we see as the demand in the market, the territories and the expected ARR growth. Yes. It's very similar to what we've been saying over time. The international markets have been more immature as to their cloud migrations and their deployment of digital applications than the North American markets, and we've been more immature in terms of our footprint. So we've talked about some examples in Investor Day and otherwise of places like Brazil and Korea to name just a couple, where we are seeing an increase of activity as well as an increase of our deployment of our capacity, which has resulted in an uptick of the international demand over time. Sales and R&D investment, we are -- we have both the sales capacity and the whole ecosystem that we've been talking about. And as Oli often says, we have more high-return product projects than we always have capacity and are attempting to make the appropriate investments. So it's really that we are layering in. We said all along that this can't be changed, headcount can't be changed as quickly as revenues. So we have periods where we're investing more than revenue growth or less. And this year is the one where we're coming from a more conservative posture of last year into more investment in both R&D and sales and marketing. There's nothing onetime or special. It relates to both sales capacity and R&D projects. Oli, anything else? I'd add as we always have said that we have a very efficient, scalable business, and we control the pace of our investments. And we -- at the same time, that we're investing, we've been investing in efficiency projects, like we talked about in the cloud to balance those things to deliver a strong profitability posture with strong investment. Yes. I think we said it's been in the range of sort of upper teens to mid-20s over time. But that type of posture of clients under-committing and evolving into their usage hasn't changed over time. So that is still in the range that we've talked about since we went public. Yes. Now to the more mundane topic of billings. So yes, I think that we did see a decel. We had a very strong Q4 in terms of commitments to us, which manifests itself in billings. We talked about the larger customers committing to multiyear deals and committing to us. We do have a sequential factor, not in our revenues, which are based on usage as must, but basically in our billings and operations like that, usually in Q1 as clients sort of commit. So in some ways, we don't have the seasonality to speak of in the revenues, but like we talked about in billings and RPO, we do have variations in billings.\n We're not reading that much into it. In that -- overall weighted, it's going to vary, and we point everyone back towards ARR and revenues, but acknowledge that, that seasonality may have been a little more pronounced in this cycle than in the previous one. No. I mean, we -- it's the same thing that we've said in every quarter that our guidance is taking the trends both in terms of usage growth and new business accumulation and it discounts them. And that's exactly the same as we said since we've been a public company. So that's what we do in providing the guidance and continue to do that in this quarter. Yes. No, we said that we don't provide guidance on the percentage of customers that are in this cohort. We just are commenting that the trends that we mentioned last quarter of the abatement of optimization in this cohort manifested itself again, and they continue to grow. Like always, our guidance takes conservative assumptions and looks across the trends in the business and assumes that there would be more conservative drivers of the business than we've had in the last quarters. So we continue with that methodology. Thank you."
