Hosting today\u2019s call are Max Levchin, Affirm\u2019s Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us in today's call. Before we get into the results, I want to start by talking about what we're actually building at Affirm. Around 10 years ago, we founded Affirm with a simple mission to deliver honest financial products that improve lives. We started by reinventing payments to make them transparent, simpler, smarter, and more delightful. Our core insight was that the generations coming of age after the financial crisis of 2008 were no longer willing to tolerate getting into permanent debt by putting it all in the card, or getting burned by late fees and deferred interest. These young consumers and many likeminded older ones, grew fundamentally suspicious of credit and retreated into the simplicity of their debit cards. This created no less than a once in a generation opportunity to transform credit, and thus, began the great unbundling of the credit card. The credit card was the ultimate buying bundle, a single product allowing you to put purchases of all sizes together in a one basket with the freedom to pay for them later. Unfortunately, if you couldn't pay for them later, and in full, endless debt became nearly inevitable and that credit card could quickly become the financial equivalent of a ball and chain. That's where Affirm came in. We deconstructed rather we unbundled the credit card, starting with the largest purchases. We made these easier, more transparent and helped consumers be smarter about buying now and paying later. In order to do all of this, we built proprietary technology from the ground up and developed sophisticated capital markets expertise. Our game plan was always simple, obsessed over consumer happiness, and use superior tech to give more people confidence to buy without resorting to the kind of dirty tricks the credit card industry is infamous for, late fees, fine print, deferred interest to name a few. We believe this would earn us the right to partner with the best most important online and offline retailers. After creating in my personal opinion, the best imaginable alternative to using a credit card for the kind of larger purchases that are most likely to get you into long-term revolving debt, such as plane tickets, homewear, sporting goods, auto parts, we sought to bring the convenience and flexibility of our longer-term pay overtime solutions to shorter-term lower price transaction. Consumer demand for simpler, more transparent payments was growing rapidly in these new segments such as fashion and apparel. These purchases naturally happen more frequently and are great opportunities to meet consumers where they shop and offer them a smarter alternative. By partnering with merchants and e-commerce platforms to offer these solutions, Affirm is able to deliver meaningful incremental sales volume via increased product sizes, improved checkout conversion, and new customer acquisition, thus enabling our partners to achieve more predictable and sustainable revenue growth. Today, we offer both the long-term pay monthly and short-term pay later solutions to our merchant partners, often as a bundle. And unlike our competitors that only offer the latter, we are neither constrained by the amount the consumer wants to spend, nor the time they need to pay us back. Thanks to our investments in technology and capital management. We leverage this technology as well as our deep merchant partnerships to bring forward the best options to consumer, always with an eye towards the fact that we will never offer a loan that we don't believe can be repaid. Our breadth of offerings enables our partners to offer their specific shoppers the right payment solution for the right item at the right moment. Our consistent results, a culture of engineering excellence, focused on intelligent risk management, depth of capital markets execution, and relentless search for opportunities to delight our shared consumers have earned the trust and partnership of some of the world's largest commerce platforms. These businesses depend on having the best technology to support their needs, and that is why they overwhelmingly choose Affirm. Our technology enables superior experiences, provide unrivaled flexibility and customization, and can address the most complex requirements. And we're constantly adding to those services. In fact, Affirm's roadmap for new merchant services is very long. We see natural product expansion opportunities wherever access to capital, risk, or complex engineering requirements prevent merchants from delighting their consumers. Our acquisition of Returnly and its unique returns management capabilities is a great example of one such idea. Another is the merchant marketplace built directly into the Affirm app and website. Purchases originating on these Affirm owned and operated services amounted to nearly one-third of transactions we facilitated in the fiscal year 2021. And these transactions are particularly valuable to our merchant partners. Merchants love our marketplace because the reach can be highly targeted, and effective in driving conversion. In this use case, Affirm is both the provider of purchasing power to the consumer and the demand generation platform for merchants. We expect to continue to find many more opportunities like these to build and buy and offer these high value services for our merchant partners. Meanwhile, the great credit card unbundling continues to accelerate in both the United States and internationally. The next frontier of unbundled payment is daily spent, groceries restaurants, incidental purchases. This is why we're so excited to be rolling out the very first card of its kind, the Affirm Debit+ card. I will tell you a lot more about it in a moment. As we speed into our fiscal year \u201922, I believe Affirm is strongly positioned to capture much more of the vast opportunity in front of us. We will do that by remaining obsessively focused on our two constituents, the merchant and the consumer, and by leveraging our core strengths to continue building products that delight both sides of our network. As we look back upon our fiscal year 2021, we made great progress on executing our strategy. We facilitated purchases for more than 7 million consumers, nearly twice the number of consumers we served in the prior fiscal year. At the same time, we delivered a fivefold increase in our active merchant base. That is merchants that transacted on our platform over the prior 12-months, thanks to several large partnerships, including Williams Sonoma, Dick's Sporting Goods, Neiman Marcus, as well as the launch of Shop Pay Installment, all of which helped add over 23,000 active merchants to our platform. We also expanded our product offerings. The savings products we introduced at the start of the fiscal year demonstrated the power of our platform to drive consumer engagement. By simply adding savings to the Affirm app, we've attracted total deposits of approximately $300 million, with no fanfare and no promotion, simply through organic engagement and a great product offering. Many of Affirm's savers have gone on to use our platform to also discover great deals with our affiliate partners and manage their financial life. On the merchant side, our recent acquisition of Returnly has meaningfully expanded our addressable market. Not only does Returnly solve one of the merchants most critical pain points, it also provides us with another unique offering for higher velocity merchants, especially in categories such as fashion and apparel, where returns are quite frequent. And of course, we extended our presence in North America by closing the acquisition of the leading pay later brand in Canada, Paybright in January. Paybright has not only expanded our presence in Canada, it is also winning exciting new business with powerful consumer brands and delighting Canadian consumers. And we're developing deep connection with our consumers. Brand awareness increased approximately 70% in fiscal year 2021, and was particularly strong among Gen Z and millennial consumers with awareness increased 94% and 60%, respectively. All these wins help us create a more valuable two sided network for our consumers and merchants, as we facilitated more than 16 million transactions totaling more than $8 billion in GMV in fiscal year \u201821. So what comes next, we have an ambitious plan for the fiscal year, and more importantly, for the decade ahead. To feel the expansion of our business and to increase our share of the growing market, we're focusing on three key areas for fiscal year \u201822. Increasing our consumer reach and frequency, growing our merchant and partner network, and extending our product offering. Our partnerships with enterprise merchants and platforms like Shopify introduced more consumers and high velocity merchants to Affirm's honest and transparent offering. In our current fiscal year, we have continued to ramp merchant activation of Shop Pay Installment. When we reported earnings back in May, we shared with you that we had on boarded 12,500 Shopify merchants at the time. And today, that number stands at hundreds of thousands. Our focus now is to drive more consumers to experience Shop Pay Installment. To do so, we're activating both Shopify and Affirm's consumer networks via range of marketing channels. To our host of integrated partnerships with the largest merchants in e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail, Affirm will be offered as a payment option for merchants representing more than half of U.S. e-commerce, which we believe will ultimately enable us to demonstrate Affirm's powerful value proposition to millions of new to Affirm consumers, and grow active consumers meaningfully in fiscal year \u201822. What excites me the most about the year ahead, is the Affirm Debit+ card. Currently in the hands of several hundred people, we've worked very hard to create a product design to meet the bar of convenience set by the best card people have in their wallet today. But we didn't stop there. Our team has designed and developed the most meaningful innovation debit card since its inception more than 50-years ago, putting unparalleled choice and flexibility directly into the hands of the consumer. The consumer can use the Affirm Debit+ card in place of the regular debit card, it connects seamlessly to their existing bank account, and no new checking account is required. Once you swipe or tap your card, you can use the intuitive debit plus companion app to turn any eligible transaction into an Affirm pay-over-time product. All it takes is a couple of taps within day after the transaction occurs. It's just that simple. This effortless access to a smarter, more transparent way of paying overtime at brick-and-mortar and online is very close to being indistinguishable from magic. But as always with Affirm, there are no magic tricks, or tricks of any kind, just excellent technology. The beauty of our card is that it's powered by software, which means that you can expect us to regularly add new features and functionality via app update. I believe Debit+ is a revolutionary idea that can truly help millions of people enjoy life with a lot less anxiety about spending and saving money. With a beta test wrapping up this month, we're very excited to bring this card out the nearly million strong waiting list of existing Affirm customers and then to the general public. I invite you to sign up for yours at affirm.com/card. It\u2019s pretty awesome, but don't take my word for it, try it yourself. On the merchant side, expanding our solutions provides greater monetization by providing cross-selling opportunities designed to also increase retention. Following the acquisition of Returnly, in the coming year, we plan to accelerate its adoption among existing Affirm merchants through our cross-selling effort. We believe the combination of Affirm's flexibility in terms of durations and Returnly\u2019s elegant solution to returns problem will deliver significant value to retailers, particularly in higher velocity categories. Beyond Returnly, we believe we can do a lot more to expand upon our strong merchant relationships, and are working on additional opportunities to leverage our technology chops and underwriting expertise to address more of our merchants need. Combined with the momentum we generated in 2021, we believe these initiatives will deliver yet another year of strong growth at scale in fiscal year \u201922, with expected year-over-year GMV growth of at least 50% based on our outlook. And, as we launch unique new offerings, such as Affirm Debit+, and activate exciting new merchant partnerships, we see a very bright, long-term future for Affirm. In closing, I've never been more excited about how well Affirm is positioned to win. Even at our blistering pace of growth, the opportunity before us is fast. Adoption by consumers and merchants alike continues to accelerate, yet, at the same time, we're just getting started. With our company's deep roots in product development and engineering, we are at our happiest and most productive when building and innovating. With so many new ways to delight consumers and solve merchants problems planned for the coming years, we're poised to expand our addressable market to grow Affirm and delivering our ambitious mission to improve lives. I want to thank our team for continually delivering for our consumers, our merchants and our shareholders. \u201821 has been a monumental year for Affirm, from preparing us to go public to integrating with some of the largest players in U.S. retail and e-commerce. The Affirm team has surmounted countless challenges with a flow. Without Affirm's hard work and continued dedication, none of this would be a reality. And I'm truly grateful for the hustle and the sacrifice. Before I turn it over to Michael, I have a quick announcement that I want to make. On September 28, Affirm will hold a virtual investor event after the market closed. We plan to share more detail about our business, our strategy and our product plans at this special events, including and especially the Affirm Debit+ card. I'd like to invite you to join us. Please look out for more information at our Investor Relations website, at investors.affirm.com. And with that, I will turn it over to Michael, to take you through the numbers.\nMichael Linford: Thanks, Max, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another set of strong results to close out our fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, we accelerated year-over-year growth rate both GMV and revenue for the second consecutive quarter to 106% and 71%, respectively. Excluding our largest merchant Peloton, which saw GMV growth of over 328% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020, our fourth quarter GMV grew 178%. We also delivered strong unit economic, excluding the provision for credit losses revenue less transaction costs reached 7% of GMV. And even as we delivered these strong results, we continue to improve the capital efficiency of our business. The equity capital used to fund our loans decreased by another 19% to $178 million, despite more than doubling GMV and nearly doubling total platform portfolio. We also continue to deliver excellent credit performance. Our allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment declined to just 5.8% down from 9.2% last year, even as we expanded credit availability within our monthly installment in slip pay loan offer. And while we are pleased with the progress we've made in the fourth quarter, we are even more excited about how our product roadmap and recent merchant partnership set us up for another year of effective strong growth in the fiscal year ahead. I will discuss our financial outlook for the fiscal year \u201822 in a moment, but let me walk you through the key highlight of the fourth quarter first. Unless stated otherwise, all period to period comparative data refers to our fourth fiscal quarter of 2021 compared to our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020. Fourth quarter GMV grew 106% to $2.5 billion, exceeding our outlook. The momentum in GMV was stronger than categories leveraged to the reopening of the economy, while we began to anniversary the steep acceleration in the growth that categories have benefited from social distancing. For the first time, fashion and beauty was our largest category, thanks to our focus in expanding into lower AOV segments, while travel and ticketing continue to grow rapidly, contributing 14% of GMV, up from 9% in our fiscal third quarter of 2021. Owing to the strong growth of our business, merchant concentration continues to decline, as Peloton contributed 9% fourth quarter GMV compared to 32% in the prior year's fourth quarter. GMV growth came for both new and existing merchant relationships as well as our direct to consumer virtual card product. Merchant signed in fiscal year \u201821 delivered 15% of our fourth quarter GMV, excluding Paybright and Returnly. Merchants launched prior to fiscal \u201821 also grew quickly, delivering more than 100% dollar based merchant retention. And excluding Peloton, our GMV from these merchants grew 92% in fiscal Q4. Additionally, our non-integrated virtual card product grew 452% this quarter. More and more consumers are choosing the Affirm's honest and transparent payment alternatives. Broken active consumers, which we measure over the prior 12-month period accelerated, effectively doubling 7.1 million. Not only are we seeing strong growth in new consumers, we are also seeing encouraging trend among existing consumers. And while we've expanded into higher frequency and lower AOV category, transactions for active consumer has increased by 8% to 2.1% to 2.3%. At the end of the fourth quarter, active merchants, those merchants who have transacted on the platform over the prior 12-months, increased to almost 29,000 compared to just 5,700 in the prior year. Thanks in large part to our partnership with Shopify. Even though, Shop Pay Installment only became generally available to Shopify merchants in the last 20 days of the fiscal year and quarter. As Max indicated, with hundreds of thousands of merchants now unable to Shop Pay Installment, we're working closely with Shopify to drive consumer awareness and get even more consumers to try Shop Pay Installment. I would also note that the overall active merchant count includes roughly 3,000 incremental Paybright and Returnly merchants, following the close of those acquisitions in January and May, respectively. Turning to the mix of our offering, we derive 38% of GMV from our 0% APR product, down from 54% in the fourth quarter of 2020. While the GMV contribution from interest bearing products increased to 62% from 46% last year. The mix shift was primarily driven by the strong growth in categories like travel, which have fewer 0% merchants and the moderation of Peloton volume. Loans with a term length of greater than 12-months accounted for 22%, down from 43% last year. While AOV declined from $672 to $495, different by the same category mix shift. As Max noted, we continue to drive a large portion of our GMV on our platform to our merchant partners from our owned properties. In the fourth quarter, 29% transactions originated on Affirm's owned and operated property with 32% if you exclude Returnly and Paybright, Strong fourth quarter GMV also helped accelerate growth and revenue. Fourth quarter net revenue of $252 million grew 71% year-over-year, up from 57% in our fiscal third quarter, and 57% in our fiscal second quarter. These results reflect the diversity of our product offering, which enable us to deliver consistent revenue growth by giving merchants and consumers greater flexibility in terms, duration, and of course, purchase size. Our ability to offer a wide range of options is one of the many reasons why so many merchants, especially many in the retails largest enterprises, choose Affirm. That flexibility, including being able to pivot from 0% APR offers to interest bearing offers, has also enabled us to quickly adapt to major changes in the environment on behalf of our merchants over the past year and a half. Total network revenue grew 23% to $108 million in the fourth quarter. However, excluding Peloton, total network revenue grew 106%. As a percentage GMV total network revenue declined 300 basis points year-over-year, and was roughly consistent on a sequential basis and reflects our growth in our interest bearing products, especially in the travel category, and our direct to consumer virtual card product. Revenue as a percentage of GMV, our total revenue take rate was 10.5%, ahead of our expectation. While down versus last year, the overwhelming majority of the year-over-year change was due to the mix of loans originated on our platform. Last year's take rate also benefited from temporary increases in MDRs as certain high AOV merchants elected to pay increase MDRs in order to secure additional revenue in the early days of the pandemic. Excluding those two factors, revenue take rates were roughly stable year-over-year. Interest income grew 111% to $104 million. However, it is important to note 40% of the increase of interest income was driven by 212% year-on-year increase, and the amortization of the discount on loans held for investment on the balance sheet, rather than consumer interest payment. The portion of interest income related to consumer interest payments grew 77%, which is roughly in line with the total revenue growth reported in the period. Revenue from gain on sales loans of $43 million, increased from $12 million in the year ago quarter, as a result of more favorable loan sale pricing and the increase in the volume of loans we sold to third parties and our 2021 non-consolidated 0% securitization transaction. Finally, servicing income of $7 million increased from $5 million in the prior year, as the average unpaid principal balance of loans owned by third parties through year-end. Now turning to expenses, total transaction cost of $114 million came in better than our outlook of $135 million to $140 million in the fourth quarter. While transaction costs grew 149% year-over-year, nearly all of the increase was related to a $58 million year to year swing in the provision for credit losses, which I will discuss in a moment. Excluding the impact of provision we continue to drive the improvement in our unit economic. Transaction costs, excluding the provision for credit losses grew just 14% compared to the total revenue growth at 71%. Looking at the components of total transaction costs, loss on loan purchase commitment was $51 million, compared to $55 million in the prior year. Loss on loan purchase commitment directly correlated to the level of longer duration 0% APR GMV originated. Provision for credit losses was $25 million, compared to a gain of $32 million in the prior year, reflecting better than expected repayment, reduced stress multiples in the year ago quarter in the context of sizable loss allowance that was established at the end of the third fiscal quarter 2020, in the very early days of pandemic. Funding costs increased from $8 million to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, consistent with the growth of loans held for investment. The increase reflects the issuance of securitization trusts, which bear an interest at a fixed rate as well as an increase in average funding debt offset by a lower average interest rate. Finally, processing and servicing cost grew 48% to $22 million, despite platform portfolio growing at 88%, reflecting the ongoing scale efficiencies we are achieving. The combination of strong top-line performance and reduced transaction cost resulted in much better than expected revenue less transaction costs of $148 million, compared to our fourth quarter outlook of $80 million to $85 million. Looking beyond transaction costs to operating expenses, our strong growth in the fourth quarter enabled us to invest long-term growth of our business. Technology and data analytics expense, which is primarily composed of personnel expenses in our product and engineering organization grew 124% to $71 million. As a percentage of total revenue, technology and data analytics increased from 21% to 27%. However, excluding the impact of stock based compensation, technology and data analytics as a percent of revenue declined by 50 basis points compared to last year. The year-over-year cash increase in technology and data analytics was driven by higher engineering headcount dedicated to deliver the exciting slate of products and technology initiatives that Max discussed. Delta marketing expenses, which include both personnel and our marketing activity, increased from $5 million to $54 million, or from 3% to 24% total revenue. Majority of the dollar growth was driven by consumer branding to drive awareness and adoption, while SBC contributed $6 million of year-over-year increase, and the warrants we issued to Shopify in conjunction with our commercial agreement, contributed $17 million. General, administrative expenses increased from $31 million last year to $138 million, or from 21% to 53% of total revenue. However, excluding stock based compensation G&A was 21% of net revenue, compared to 19% in the year ago quarter. The cash increase in G&A was primarily the result of increased headcount to support the company's long-term growth and public company operation. Including these expenses, GAAP operating loss was $125 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to a GAAP operating income of $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Despite making these significant investments in our long-term growth, we delivered positive adjusted operating income. Adding back G&A, stock based compensation, the amortization of Shopify\u2019s warrant, and other one-time expenses, adjusted operating income was $14 million, compared to $47 million in the prior year, or 5.4% of total revenue. Turning to our balance sheet, we delivered triple digit GMV growth, while driving even more efficiency from a capital perspective. Total platform portfolio, which we define as the unpaid principal balance outstanding for all loans facilitated through our platform, including those loans owned by third-party increased $2.2 billion from June 30, 2020, $4.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Half of the $2.2 billion increase was funded on a non-consolidated basis through a combination of forward flow and our first unconsolidated securitization transaction. The rest was funded through consolidation, securitization, and warehouse facility. In terms of our overall funding mix, warehouse financing continued to shrink from $1.0 billion to $0.7 billion at June 30, 2021. We expect to fund future growth primarily through a combination of loan sales and securitization transaction, which continue to garner strong demand in the ABS market from a diverse array of large institutional investors. As alluded to previously, during the quarter, we successfully closed 2021 Z-1, our first unconsolidated securitization transaction. In addition, we recently issued our six ABS transaction 2021 B, at a very attractive financing terms, resulting in minimal equity capital required by Affirm. By establishing ourselves as a programmatic ABS issuer, the securitization, in conjunction with our committed forward flow agreements and warehouse facilities provide us with financial flexibility to support our GMV growth aspirations, by creating meaningful capacity to efficiently fund billions of dollars of loan with negligible incremental equity capital requirements. A material noteworthy results of our approach to funding optimization across these channels is the reduction of equity capital we use to fund our business. Equity capital required declined by 19% in the year ago quarter, from $221 million to $178 million, despite growing our loans and the balance sheet by $1 billion. Accordingly, as a percentage of total platform portfolio, equity capital required fell to below 4% from 9% in the year ago quarter. Now turning to the year ahead, we expect the strategic progress we made in the fiscal year 2021 and the accelerating consumer and merchant adoption of our offering will drive strong growth once again in fiscal year 2022. Before I dive in the numbers let me share some color on our outlook. After a year of explosive growth, we expect the moderation and Peloton GMV in fiscal Year 2022. Our Peloton business benefited from strong pandemic-related tailwind last year, as well as the introduction of new products, including the highly successful Bike+ [ph] and lower price Tread in September of 2020. Additionally, we have not included any GMV or revenue from the Amazon partnership we have recently announced. We are currently in the early stages of integration. We will update you on the progress and the incremental impact to our outlook each quarter. Finally, while we are very excited about the rollout of the Affirm Debit+ card, our outlook for fiscal year \u201822 also does not include a contribution from this new product. GMV and revenue from this new product would also the incremental to our outlook. With that context in mind, for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, we expect gross merchandise volume to increase between 50% and 54% from fiscal year \u201821, to between $12.45 billion to $12.75 billion. Excluding Peloton, we expect GMV growth of 70% to 75%. We also expect our split pay offering contribute 10% to 15% of our fiscal year 2022 GMV. The largest contributor of this volume coming from the Shop Pay Installment program. Importantly, we expect revenue of $1.16 billion to $1.19 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 33% to 37%. Owing to the ongoing mix shift, we expect modest contraction in total revenue as a percentage of GMV in fiscal year 2022, as implied in our outlook. Turning to expenses, we expect transaction costs of $605 million to $620 million. As a percentage of total revenue, we also expect modest deleverage in transaction cost as a percentage of revenue. As a result, we expect revenue less transaction cost of $555 million to $570 million. As Max said in his comment, we plan to deliver an exciting slate of consumer and merchant product offering in fiscal year 2022, as well as over the next several years. To drive the success of these initiatives, we are investing in engineering and product talent here in the United States, and deploying a new Engineering Center in Poland. As a result, we have significant investment in technology and data analytics in fiscal year \u201822. We're also increasing our spending and marketing to drive consumer awareness and adoption. Accordingly, we expect an adjusted operating loss of $145 million to $135 million. Finally, we expect weighted average shares of approximately $290 million for the year. For our first quarter ending September 30, 2021, we expect GMV to grow 64% to 67% to $2.42 billion to $2.52 billion. We expect that the growth to drive total revenue of $240 million to $250 million. Our outlook for the first quarter also contemplates transaction costs of $145 million to $150 million. Revenue less transaction costs of $95 million to $100 million, adjusted operating loss of $68 million to $63 million, and weighted average shares outstanding of $275 million. In closing, we have made another year of excellent progress on our mission to bring consumers and merchants together with honest financial product. Like Max, I'm extremely proud of the team's accomplishments over the last year. We are shaping the future of finance for the better. And every day more and more consumers and merchants are coming to Affirm for honest, transparent and delightful product experiences. I have never been more confident in our competitive position, nor more excited about the future that lies ahead. Here's to another year of the extraordinary achievements to come. And with that, we're happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is for Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question this evening, and congratulations on these impressive results. I wanted to ask about your Shopify relationship. And in terms of signing new merchants I mean, the quarter saw such a huge step up in active merchants. How far penetrated do you think you are at this term in terms of the merchant base available to you? Sort of what inning are you in with the process of rolling out Shopify?\nMax Levchin: Asking me about innings will immediately highlight\u2026\nRamsey El-Assal: Any sports metaphor you want to\u2026\nMax Levchin: I'm only good for one. We're like the day before the rest day \u2013 the first week of Tour de France, the only sport I'm good for. I have no idea how many innings exists in any base first, if I\u2019m honest. I would say early. So just to give you a sense how the process actually works. So you first have to educate the merchant base, then you have to onboard them, then you start activating them both for marketing and just exposure to consumers and then eventually start processing volume. And so you can kind of think of it in these four stages. The number we highlighted in both Michael\u2019s remark and mine is the tens of thousands of actives across our territories, but obviously Shopify question here. If you look at the on boarded, which is the stage before that number is in the hundreds of thousands now. And so we will start ramping the next stages of that process for the merchants, but it will take time. So it's early, very happy with how it's going. Lots more to cover.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And then I wanted to ask you a kind of a higher elevation question about all the M&A we\u2019ve seen in the space over the last few months. It seems like there's kind of an accelerating trend towards bundling buy now pay later and with other financial services. And I know you guys are sort of embarking on that from sort of the other direction, but can you give us your thoughts on industry consolidation what maybe the end state of the industry looks like and sort of the different strategic paths available to you guys?\nMax Levchin: I can certainly try. I think if we want to speculate. So first of all, just to level set, the e-commerce is $800 billion in the U.S. or so. And I think, buy now pay later, and the various names I\u2019ll refer to, in my mind unbundled credit card, because we're really trying to make that point in my little speech. But the whole idea here is the industry is very rapidly unbundling the credit card product into a bunch of different connected services. All that said, it's still like in the 3% to 4% of the overall e-commerce and then of course, non e-commerce part, and so long road to go. But that's really, really important to understand. So I think companies like Affirm that have a vision that extends past handful of years, really does have a lot of growth and a lot of product building to do. So from that point of view, we are very keen observers of the industry. We think ourselves, great technologists, obviously, really careful risk managers, manager and really thoughtful builders of things. And we're not bad at all markets. Those are kind of the key notes in our chord that we're trying to strike with the industry, wherever we can build, or buy more merchant services that speaks to those strengths. That's what we're looking for. And Returnly is kind of great highlight, it's just a beautiful, complimentary service that fits into all those strengths, instantly benefited from cross sell to merchants, instantly benefitted from our depth of capital markets. They're not bad risk managers themselves. But obviously, we have to share those now. So that you will see us do more and more often, and we think there is just a lot to do there. Not necessarily always buying, but we are very keen on creating this ultimate merchant bundle with those three key areas as the guiding principles. The industry itself, I think, to be completely honest, I'm a little surprised by the earliness. That's a word of the consolidation. But that said, usually harsh relations, the aggravating specifically, I think these guys are building really cool barriers to the product. And I'm pleased to see that the market creating value is important. We are obviously a much, much, much wider impact surface. We cover both the short-term pain for it all the way out to multiyear monthly payments, both interest bearing and interest free. We involve manufacturers and subsidizing some of the interest payments for consumers, I think just a much, much, much broader rounded out offering. And so the opportunities for us to extend well beyond sort of plugging our point solution into someone else's larger vision.  We will decide on their own. That said, I do think that the entire financial ecosystem, well beyond the startup, really everyone has now fully woken up to the idea that buy now pay later unbundled credit card is a huge opportunity and consumers are driving that change. And so that's just really important. It's happening very, very quickly. And we happen to be surfing that wave. But there's a lot more companies that are now playing there as well. That's what we really can see.\nRamsey El-Assal: That\u2019s hugely helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, thanks, guys. Congrats on the numbers here. I wanted to start with a question just on the revs transaction expenses for \u201822 is going to be 4.5% of GMV. And I know that that's materially higher than the low to mid 3% range that I think you had historically targeted. So should we think of the mid 4%s as kind of a new normal? Or are there some anomalies that you would call out for fiscal \u201822? I mean, I know the number was even higher the last couple of quarters, but just wanted to see how we should think about it on a more normalized basis.\nMichael Linford: Yeah, I think there's a couple things to think about here. It has been higher recently, although we have benefited from continued improvement and credit outlook that has contributed nicely. When you look forward, as you model out the split pay low AOV business, you will see numbers coming down there just a start to the much smaller revenue base. So as a percentage of GMV you do have revenue less transaction costs of those transactions. We've indicated that we expect 10% to 15% of next year's number to be there. Over the longer term, we do expect that to continue to grow faster. And so I think we'd like to maintain the kind of longer term indication we've given everybody.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. So we should still think about that really mid 3% just based on mix over the longer term.\nMichael Linford: That's right.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And then, just following the Amazon announcement how your pipeline works for other potential large merchant wins. And then maybe as part of that, can you just talk a little bit about the availability on Amazon? I think press releases that kind of upcoming month, but would you encourage us to think about that, as you know next quarter or is it more like two to three quarters out?\nMax Levchin: So I think we try to be as disclosive and as careful as we can be, when we talk about such large important partnerships. The testing is ongoing, literally day in out, we're in that phase of a partnership. And I think the opportunity to offer is enormous, the exact contours availability, both where and when, a little bit beyond the scope of this particular conversation. In terms of enterprise pipeline, what I want to do my own horn too much here, but we have become sort of the undisputed provider of the service to the enterprises, because we are really that good. We think that any enterprise thinking about offering buy now pay later, or pay monthly looks at Affirm as the gold standard. And we intend to provide those services to people like them. Always a terrible idea to pre-announce deals or pre announce deals that aren\u2019t closed, shouldn't really be coming to the pipeline. But certainly have extreme conviction that what we built resonates with folks that care about technology, scalability, availability, delivery of full suite of products, or the postal port solution. So in essence, I think the market is meeting us where we are with our suite of services.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Well, thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please, proceed.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. And let me add my congratulations, as well. Max I wanted to maybe dive in a little bit onto that last question a bit. And the question really, is the nature of which Amazon chose you guys. You threw off a couple things there. But I mean, is it ultimately the breadth of product? Is it that you solve kind of the sweet spot for them and helping them convert? And is it also that there's this parallel kind of roadmap that you might share with them, but just any, I think incremental color in terms of maybe why that relationship was born would be very helpful. Thanks.\nMax Levchin: Again, I think it is important to say that as announced it is a test we are working very hard to make sure the test is successful. The reason companies have the scale and customer obsession, which, by the way, one reason why companies of this type, perhaps to this. Everything I said technology, risk management, conversion all of that is true, but at the very core it is with the end consumer. We want to deliver the best possible service. Sorry, I'm getting feedback that it's very hard to hear me. Is this any better?\nDan Perlin: I can hear you fine.\nMax Levchin: Sorry. I'll try to add more microphones too. So the punchline is we are obsessed with consumer delight. We want to make sure that we are driving sales, increasing conversion, improving the size of cards, all of that while being on the consumer side, without charging them late fees, without burying gotchas and fine print and things like that. And I think that is typically the cornerstone of our most successful partnerships. That is where these enterprise merchants that expect to live for hundreds of years and have lots of repeat transactions, they want to know that we will treat their consumers right that their consumer doesn't become just a footnote in chase for revenue, et cetera. So I think that that's really, really important. And that's where a lot of the relationships are forged, that's what we bring in. That's we take that very seriously. And certainly as do they. Sorry, I'll stop ranting. But the other thing, perhaps worth noting, I think that's the important thing here is I think the wave of the industry that I highlighted is what's driving a lot of these widgets as well. We are divested technology, we are really the most scalable provider here, as these very, very large retailers say, you know what, this isn't going away. It's not a cool feature. It's a real product. They look to us to provide.\nDan Perlin: And then my follow-up just briefly, kind of as an extension to that, as you aptly noted, you're winning a lot of these enterprise platform deals. The question I guess, longer term is, how do you think about and this is a high quality problem, obviously, but how do you think about the potential concentration risk that a company like shop and Amazon Peloton will come back and you probably will win other large scale enterprise relationships? I'm just wondering how you think about that? And what are those discussions like internally about how to mitigate some of those risk concerns? Thank you.\nMax Levchin: It's a great question. I'm honest, I think our job is to build exceptional product and maintain our leadership, both intellectually and at the product level. Enterprises, you inevitably run some level of concentration risk. I think we've demonstrated simply looking at Peloton that we're quite good at diversifying those concentration risks. So I can say, we don't know what to do about risks in general. But at the very core, our success depends on our ability to build great products and run it successfully at great unit economics, et cetera. So that\u2019s what we will do.\nDan Perlin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Max, I want to kind of build on the theme of adding new merchants, et cetera. In our own research, we saw a bit slower growth among the largest online merchants, which is probably understandable and largest online ones outside of Amazon. But that's understandable, given the push to bring shop merchants on et cetera. How should we think about just more generally merchant growth dynamics going forward? And I think this builds a little bit on the last question, should we expect a lot more bigger merchants near-term? Or is it still like building up a broader base just kind of help us think through what you're targeting, and where you're putting effort?\nMax Levchin: Yeah, we think this product makes a lot of sense for consumers, first and foremost. And, at this point, the premier provider of the services to platforms of various kinds, we intend to bring products to market with them. And that is really important to us. But that's fueling a fair amount of our excitement here. That said, we very much care about smaller merchants. In fact, we are investing in areas of merchants self-service, making sure that we can bring someone live from near interest in Affirm to accepting transactions as quickly as possible. One of the core metrics we review literally every week is hey, how long did it take to go from an interested Affirm to take in first transaction and that's something that we are concentrated, minimize. It really matters for these little shops that do not have a legal team, and so on, and so forth. So we see ourselves as providers, not just to the very largest, but also to everyone, mid tail, long tail. All those are great customers. And frankly, the impact that we have on the long tail base is really staggering. That's where you can have share of cards that can number in sort of the staggering high double digit numbers. Now, we're so interested and so invested in these platinum partnerships, because a lot of them carry enormous amount of long tail. So building our service in a way that consumable and installable really easy, really high converting both at the consumer end, but at the really small merchant is really important to us. Merchants' self-service pipeline works really well by way of integrating with all the platforms, all the e-commerce platforms out there at this point. I can think of one where we're not supportive, but it also through these partnerships. And so we intend to go after every imaginable merchant out there, both online and also we have our design to offer.\nJames Faucette: That's great. And just as a quick follow-up, this is for you, Michael. Can you give a little bit more color on, I guess, kind of the activity mix during the quarter. I asked, because number of users was a lot better than we had modeled and things like virtual card network revenue was better as well as gain on sale. But on the flip side, like the merchant network revenues were a little less. So just wondering how we should think about like, what caused that during the course of the quarter perhaps, and then how we should kind of think about that next volatility, if you will, going forward?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. So the change in which income statement lines the revenue hits is very much a function of the product. So as we mix away from longer term 0% loan, you'll see loans that are coming into the interest bearing side, as we talked about, we did have a higher maximum interest bearing this quarter. And, when we put those on our balance sheet, we are an interest income. And when we tell them, we get the gain on sale, and you saw that big growth and gain on sale there. And the underlying reasons are related to the segments that saw the strongest growth. And so we had segments like travel and ticketing, which obviously, as early stages of the reopening saw explosive growth. But also we had our direct to consumer virtual card product, Affirm Anywhere, grow substantially. And that product has a little bit of virtual card network revenue, and then obviously, interest bearing activity behind it. And so really, it's the mix of products that shows up with driving those results. And as we've said many times before, we really don't look at or try to manage those deadlines, we target a total revenue number and try to deliver that. And we keep a keen eye on that revenue, less transaction cost number to make sure we're delivering really strong unit economics, that we can generate the revenue and generate the unit economics, the rest of itself sorts it out.\nJames Faucette: That's really good context. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. Max, I'm intrigued by the Affirm Debit+ product and recognizing that you're not including any GMV or revenue in your guidance. I wonder if you could just flush out a couple things for us. One, what do you think is the most likely use case mix of Affirm split a purchases or Affirm loan purchases versus sort of broad use. And then also, how do you think that product affects repayment tender? Does it definitionally results in a debit based loan repayment? Or is there more of an ACH characteristic? I'm just trying to think through the dynamics as this product takes hold and gains traction?\nMax Levchin: That's a great question. Sure, I can hit them all. But this is like, this was going to be awesome. It\u2019s a great set of questions. But I am tempering my excitement for the product because I know our lawyer watching. But it is hard to tempering, it\u2019s a great product. First of all, the use cases are that we envisioned is the one I've been testing the product more or less daily for the last month or two. And I bought an incredible amount of coffee, public service announcement do not buy pre ground beans. I buy all beans only, but it's in the tens of pounds at this point. That is my closest walk through for recognizing the debit card. And it's pretty cool. It works with my existing checking accounts. So when I do nothing, it just settled against that period of time. And when I feel like swiping left, turning into a pay-over-time transaction, that's what it does. And it's super smooth, very quick to physical card. So no different from one that your bank gave you. The expectation and the intent that we have for this product is that it really takes place as your top of wallet, primary transacting device, stepping back further and I'll allow myself a little bit of storytelling. One way of analyzing this whole BNPL revolution is actually is \u2013 there was like 100 million plus people that basically said, I'm just going to use my debit card because I don't understand credit cards, but I know they're good partners. And, those people can disagree, but I generally think decide that you put it all on a piece of plastic and then revolve then you pay interest on your lot size and your coffee beans. And your more expensive purchases, you're doing it wrong, like you shouldn't be paying interest in those things. And as a result that will these people basically said, yeah, I kind of get it, I don't have a better alternative. So I'm just going to live within my means and use my debit card. And every once in a while somebody like Affirm or one of our competitors would come along and say, hey, you're buying this thing, and it doesn't fit into your debit card budget, that's cool. You can use this every temper time solution that we've developed, it's available at the point of sale. That\u2019s what they call math Olympiad a partial solution, like, yeah, it's great, but you don't get full marks for that. What do you really want is a ubiquitous tool that allows you to say, hey, anytime I want to use a debit, I'm just going to use my debit. And anytime I want to turn it into a pay-over-time transaction, it's got to be very easy. It can't be harder than using a credit card. It has to be as simple and really, really convenient. And that's what we built with Debit+, and so that's the most important thing to understand.  We fundamentally connected the dots between this partial solution of buy now pay later at the point of sale, by moving into the hands of the end consumer built right into a debit card without asking them to change their accounts, et cetera. And so that's why I'm so jazzed about it, probably partially to do with just the sheer amount of coffee that I bought. But that's sort of part one. I would lie if I told you that I know exactly what's going to happen with all the different pertinent modalities et cetera. Still, in early beta, a lot of its consumers are telling us it's awesome. And we're learning a lot about how they're using this. But generally speaking, the goal is to delight the end customer.  And this is a big group of people that says, hey, I love the idea of having very tight control sense of financial responsibility and sanity by just paying for things with this really, really simple pay-over-time instruments, and mostly not. And what we have built is something that marries the two, really elegantly. That's what we're launching and sort of bringing to market. And over time, we think there's a lot of other cool stuff to add. And, I sort of use this software defined payments as a jargony thing that I came up with, but that's the idea. We will continue adding features to the card and the app by software updates. There'll be a lot of fun stuff to add to it. Not announcing any of those yet, but you can imagine how the output possibility.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Maybe to follow-up on that and some of the previous questions. As you expand, as a Affirm is able to expand its marketplace and the consumers that shop there and now with the debit card, can you talk about how I mean the expansion of the TAM, that that would provide essentially and how often can you earn affiliate Bs? How often not? Like, how do we think about the underlying economics perhaps, as you're able to expand in those ways?\nMax Levchin: That's a really good question. So, again, without -- I realized I'm sounding a little bit like a child high in a pile of sugar, but I think this bed is busting it's pretty awesome. And we wanted to be the primary transactional device for our consumers. So the TAM is they're spend, 20 times a month on food and things like that. So it's shopping, or it's purchasing, whatever you call it. In that sense, we have infinite ambition. In terms of affiliate fees, I think the important thing there is, obviously we've done pretty well, we can sort of see that in our numbers or at least from our numbers there. We are not yet focused on that to be completely transparent. We're trying to build an amazing experience. We\u2019re trying to convince our consumers that this is a far better way of buying things. Over time, obviously, a tremendous value for our merchant partners or whoever our consumers choose to go to and shop, if we brought that customer to them, it's a service that we bundle, if you will, with the transaction itself. There's plenty of sort of advertising or marketing revenue to compete for there. But it served the -- that's part two. Part one is we want the consumer that picks up that across to say this is the best thing ever. I don't really need to use my real debit card anymore because this is better and I certainly don't have to touch my credit card ever again. That assuming we hit that \u2013 I was just going to say hit that out of the park, but I realized that I know what I'm talking about, again. Assuming we deliver on that I think affiliate fees will come. We'll start forecasting that as we measure the actual penetration. But the TAM itself is enormous.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up on the Amazon relationship or test. Could you talk about how that will be presented to the consumer, like, because there are multiple products that Amazon does offer, from a payments standpoint, and anything that you can kind of tell us as to whether how Amazon is going to be choosing to do that or how that process works? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: I'm afraid that's what tests are for to figure out the best presentation, best user interface and ultimately, we all know what works best. And then we're all here.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.\nRob Wildhack: Hey, guys, thanks for fitting me in. Just a question on funding. Michael, you called out drivers in gain on sale for this quarter. But just wanted to get your latest outlook for the demand and pricing trends on home loans from here? And how that could potentially flow through to the level of equity capital required going forward?\nMichael Linford: Yeah, so we fund our business with now four different funding tools, securitizations that both get consolidated, and then our non-consolidated board flow and on the warehouse side. In our earning supplement, we show a pretty good breakdown of the funding mix by channel. And, the growth that you saw this quarter was predominantly in securitizations, but not consolidated and consolidated. When the securitization is consolidated, it does show up on the balance sheet as an asset, but it's really efficient. If you look at the last two deals we've done, we're kind of borrowing 97% or 98%, on average of the consumer balances, which is obviously just an extremely efficient way to fund it with respect to equity capital. But to answer your question, specifically around the market and the reaction and pricing around forward flow, it remains very strong. I think the demand for Affirm Paper in the market is really high. They desire the asset type, which is really short in duration. And they acknowledge that we've been really good at underwriting, and so they really liked the credit quality we can generate.\nRob Wildhack: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us in today's call. Before we get into the results, I want to start by talking about what we're actually building at Affirm. Around 10 years ago, we founded Affirm with a simple mission to deliver honest financial products that improve lives. We started by reinventing payments to make them transparent, simpler, smarter, and more delightful. Our core insight was that the generations coming of age after the financial crisis of 2008 were no longer willing to tolerate getting into permanent debt by putting it all in the card, or getting burned by late fees and deferred interest. These young consumers and many likeminded older ones, grew fundamentally suspicious of credit and retreated into the simplicity of their debit cards. This created no less than a once in a generation opportunity to transform credit, and thus, began the great unbundling of the credit card. The credit card was the ultimate buying bundle, a single product allowing you to put purchases of all sizes together in a one basket with the freedom to pay for them later. Unfortunately, if you couldn't pay for them later, and in full, endless debt became nearly inevitable and that credit card could quickly become the financial equivalent of a ball and chain. That's where Affirm came in. We deconstructed rather we unbundled the credit card, starting with the largest purchases. We made these easier, more transparent and helped consumers be smarter about buying now and paying later. In order to do all of this, we built proprietary technology from the ground up and developed sophisticated capital markets expertise. Our game plan was always simple, obsessed over consumer happiness, and use superior tech to give more people confidence to buy without resorting to the kind of dirty tricks the credit card industry is infamous for, late fees, fine print, deferred interest to name a few. We believe this would earn us the right to partner with the best most important online and offline retailers. After creating in my personal opinion, the best imaginable alternative to using a credit card for the kind of larger purchases that are most likely to get you into long-term revolving debt, such as plane tickets, homewear, sporting goods, auto parts, we sought to bring the convenience and flexibility of our longer-term pay overtime solutions to shorter-term lower price transaction. Consumer demand for simpler, more transparent payments was growing rapidly in these new segments such as fashion and apparel. These purchases naturally happen more frequently and are great opportunities to meet consumers where they shop and offer them a smarter alternative. By partnering with merchants and e-commerce platforms to offer these solutions, Affirm is able to deliver meaningful incremental sales volume via increased product sizes, improved checkout conversion, and new customer acquisition, thus enabling our partners to achieve more predictable and sustainable revenue growth. Today, we offer both the long-term pay monthly and short-term pay later solutions to our merchant partners, often as a bundle. And unlike our competitors that only offer the latter, we are neither constrained by the amount the consumer wants to spend, nor the time they need to pay us back. Thanks to our investments in technology and capital management. We leverage this technology as well as our deep merchant partnerships to bring forward the best options to consumer, always with an eye towards the fact that we will never offer a loan that we don't believe can be repaid. Our breadth of offerings enables our partners to offer their specific shoppers the right payment solution for the right item at the right moment. Our consistent results, a culture of engineering excellence, focused on intelligent risk management, depth of capital markets execution, and relentless search for opportunities to delight our shared consumers have earned the trust and partnership of some of the world's largest commerce platforms. These businesses depend on having the best technology to support their needs, and that is why they overwhelmingly choose Affirm. Our technology enables superior experiences, provide unrivaled flexibility and customization, and can address the most complex requirements. And we're constantly adding to those services. In fact, Affirm's roadmap for new merchant services is very long. We see natural product expansion opportunities wherever access to capital, risk, or complex engineering requirements prevent merchants from delighting their consumers. Our acquisition of Returnly and its unique returns management capabilities is a great example of one such idea. Another is the merchant marketplace built directly into the Affirm app and website. Purchases originating on these Affirm owned and operated services amounted to nearly one-third of transactions we facilitated in the fiscal year 2021. And these transactions are particularly valuable to our merchant partners. Merchants love our marketplace because the reach can be highly targeted, and effective in driving conversion. In this use case, Affirm is both the provider of purchasing power to the consumer and the demand generation platform for merchants. We expect to continue to find many more opportunities like these to build and buy and offer these high value services for our merchant partners. Meanwhile, the great credit card unbundling continues to accelerate in both the United States and internationally. The next frontier of unbundled payment is daily spent, groceries restaurants, incidental purchases. This is why we're so excited to be rolling out the very first card of its kind, the Affirm Debit+ card. I will tell you a lot more about it in a moment. As we speed into our fiscal year \u201922, I believe Affirm is strongly positioned to capture much more of the vast opportunity in front of us. We will do that by remaining obsessively focused on our two constituents, the merchant and the consumer, and by leveraging our core strengths to continue building products that delight both sides of our network. As we look back upon our fiscal year 2021, we made great progress on executing our strategy. We facilitated purchases for more than 7 million consumers, nearly twice the number of consumers we served in the prior fiscal year. At the same time, we delivered a fivefold increase in our active merchant base. That is merchants that transacted on our platform over the prior 12-months, thanks to several large partnerships, including Williams Sonoma, Dick's Sporting Goods, Neiman Marcus, as well as the launch of Shop Pay Installment, all of which helped add over 23,000 active merchants to our platform. We also expanded our product offerings. The savings products we introduced at the start of the fiscal year demonstrated the power of our platform to drive consumer engagement. By simply adding savings to the Affirm app, we've attracted total deposits of approximately $300 million, with no fanfare and no promotion, simply through organic engagement and a great product offering. Many of Affirm's savers have gone on to use our platform to also discover great deals with our affiliate partners and manage their financial life. On the merchant side, our recent acquisition of Returnly has meaningfully expanded our addressable market. Not only does Returnly solve one of the merchants most critical pain points, it also provides us with another unique offering for higher velocity merchants, especially in categories such as fashion and apparel, where returns are quite frequent. And of course, we extended our presence in North America by closing the acquisition of the leading pay later brand in Canada, Paybright in January. Paybright has not only expanded our presence in Canada, it is also winning exciting new business with powerful consumer brands and delighting Canadian consumers. And we're developing deep connection with our consumers. Brand awareness increased approximately 70% in fiscal year 2021, and was particularly strong among Gen Z and millennial consumers with awareness increased 94% and 60%, respectively. All these wins help us create a more valuable two sided network for our consumers and merchants, as we facilitated more than 16 million transactions totaling more than $8 billion in GMV in fiscal year \u201821. So what comes next, we have an ambitious plan for the fiscal year, and more importantly, for the decade ahead. To feel the expansion of our business and to increase our share of the growing market, we're focusing on three key areas for fiscal year \u201822. Increasing our consumer reach and frequency, growing our merchant and partner network, and extending our product offering. Our partnerships with enterprise merchants and platforms like Shopify introduced more consumers and high velocity merchants to Affirm's honest and transparent offering. In our current fiscal year, we have continued to ramp merchant activation of Shop Pay Installment. When we reported earnings back in May, we shared with you that we had on boarded 12,500 Shopify merchants at the time. And today, that number stands at hundreds of thousands. Our focus now is to drive more consumers to experience Shop Pay Installment. To do so, we're activating both Shopify and Affirm's consumer networks via range of marketing channels. To our host of integrated partnerships with the largest merchants in e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail, Affirm will be offered as a payment option for merchants representing more than half of U.S. e-commerce, which we believe will ultimately enable us to demonstrate Affirm's powerful value proposition to millions of new to Affirm consumers, and grow active consumers meaningfully in fiscal year \u201822. What excites me the most about the year ahead, is the Affirm Debit+ card. Currently in the hands of several hundred people, we've worked very hard to create a product design to meet the bar of convenience set by the best card people have in their wallet today. But we didn't stop there. Our team has designed and developed the most meaningful innovation debit card since its inception more than 50-years ago, putting unparalleled choice and flexibility directly into the hands of the consumer. The consumer can use the Affirm Debit+ card in place of the regular debit card, it connects seamlessly to their existing bank account, and no new checking account is required. Once you swipe or tap your card, you can use the intuitive debit plus companion app to turn any eligible transaction into an Affirm pay-over-time product. All it takes is a couple of taps within day after the transaction occurs. It's just that simple. This effortless access to a smarter, more transparent way of paying overtime at brick-and-mortar and online is very close to being indistinguishable from magic. But as always with Affirm, there are no magic tricks, or tricks of any kind, just excellent technology. The beauty of our card is that it's powered by software, which means that you can expect us to regularly add new features and functionality via app update. I believe Debit+ is a revolutionary idea that can truly help millions of people enjoy life with a lot less anxiety about spending and saving money. With a beta test wrapping up this month, we're very excited to bring this card out the nearly million strong waiting list of existing Affirm customers and then to the general public. I invite you to sign up for yours at affirm.com/card. It\u2019s pretty awesome, but don't take my word for it, try it yourself. On the merchant side, expanding our solutions provides greater monetization by providing cross-selling opportunities designed to also increase retention. Following the acquisition of Returnly, in the coming year, we plan to accelerate its adoption among existing Affirm merchants through our cross-selling effort. We believe the combination of Affirm's flexibility in terms of durations and Returnly\u2019s elegant solution to returns problem will deliver significant value to retailers, particularly in higher velocity categories. Beyond Returnly, we believe we can do a lot more to expand upon our strong merchant relationships, and are working on additional opportunities to leverage our technology chops and underwriting expertise to address more of our merchants need. Combined with the momentum we generated in 2021, we believe these initiatives will deliver yet another year of strong growth at scale in fiscal year \u201922, with expected year-over-year GMV growth of at least 50% based on our outlook. And, as we launch unique new offerings, such as Affirm Debit+, and activate exciting new merchant partnerships, we see a very bright, long-term future for Affirm. In closing, I've never been more excited about how well Affirm is positioned to win. Even at our blistering pace of growth, the opportunity before us is fast. Adoption by consumers and merchants alike continues to accelerate, yet, at the same time, we're just getting started. With our company's deep roots in product development and engineering, we are at our happiest and most productive when building and innovating. With so many new ways to delight consumers and solve merchants problems planned for the coming years, we're poised to expand our addressable market to grow Affirm and delivering our ambitious mission to improve lives. I want to thank our team for continually delivering for our consumers, our merchants and our shareholders. \u201821 has been a monumental year for Affirm, from preparing us to go public to integrating with some of the largest players in U.S. retail and e-commerce. The Affirm team has surmounted countless challenges with a flow. Without Affirm's hard work and continued dedication, none of this would be a reality. And I'm truly grateful for the hustle and the sacrifice. Before I turn it over to Michael, I have a quick announcement that I want to make. On September 28, Affirm will hold a virtual investor event after the market closed. We plan to share more detail about our business, our strategy and our product plans at this special events, including and especially the Affirm Debit+ card. I'd like to invite you to join us. Please look out for more information at our Investor Relations website, at investors.affirm.com. And with that, I will turn it over to Michael, to take you through the numbers. Asking me about innings will immediately highlight\u2026 I'm only good for one. We're like the day before the rest day \u2013 the first week of Tour de France, the only sport I'm good for. I have no idea how many innings exists in any base first, if I\u2019m honest. I would say early. So just to give you a sense how the process actually works. So you first have to educate the merchant base, then you have to onboard them, then you start activating them both for marketing and just exposure to consumers and then eventually start processing volume. And so you can kind of think of it in these four stages. The number we highlighted in both Michael\u2019s remark and mine is the tens of thousands of actives across our territories, but obviously Shopify question here. If you look at the on boarded, which is the stage before that number is in the hundreds of thousands now. And so we will start ramping the next stages of that process for the merchants, but it will take time. So it's early, very happy with how it's going. Lots more to cover. I can certainly try. I think if we want to speculate. So first of all, just to level set, the e-commerce is $800 billion in the U.S. or so. And I think, buy now pay later, and the various names I\u2019ll refer to, in my mind unbundled credit card, because we're really trying to make that point in my little speech. But the whole idea here is the industry is very rapidly unbundling the credit card product into a bunch of different connected services. All that said, it's still like in the 3% to 4% of the overall e-commerce and then of course, non e-commerce part, and so long road to go. But that's really, really important to understand. So I think companies like Affirm that have a vision that extends past handful of years, really does have a lot of growth and a lot of product building to do. So from that point of view, we are very keen observers of the industry. We think ourselves, great technologists, obviously, really careful risk managers, manager and really thoughtful builders of things. And we're not bad at all markets. Those are kind of the key notes in our chord that we're trying to strike with the industry, wherever we can build, or buy more merchant services that speaks to those strengths. That's what we're looking for. And Returnly is kind of great highlight, it's just a beautiful, complimentary service that fits into all those strengths, instantly benefited from cross sell to merchants, instantly benefitted from our depth of capital markets. They're not bad risk managers themselves. But obviously, we have to share those now. So that you will see us do more and more often, and we think there is just a lot to do there. Not necessarily always buying, but we are very keen on creating this ultimate merchant bundle with those three key areas as the guiding principles. The industry itself, I think, to be completely honest, I'm a little surprised by the earliness. That's a word of the consolidation. But that said, usually harsh relations, the aggravating specifically, I think these guys are building really cool barriers to the product. And I'm pleased to see that the market creating value is important. We are obviously a much, much, much wider impact surface. We cover both the short-term pain for it all the way out to multiyear monthly payments, both interest bearing and interest free. We involve manufacturers and subsidizing some of the interest payments for consumers, I think just a much, much, much broader rounded out offering. And so the opportunities for us to extend well beyond sort of plugging our point solution into someone else's larger vision.  We will decide on their own. That said, I do think that the entire financial ecosystem, well beyond the startup, really everyone has now fully woken up to the idea that buy now pay later unbundled credit card is a huge opportunity and consumers are driving that change. And so that's just really important. It's happening very, very quickly. And we happen to be surfing that wave. But there's a lot more companies that are now playing there as well. That's what we really can see. So I think we try to be as disclosive and as careful as we can be, when we talk about such large important partnerships. The testing is ongoing, literally day in out, we're in that phase of a partnership. And I think the opportunity to offer is enormous, the exact contours availability, both where and when, a little bit beyond the scope of this particular conversation. In terms of enterprise pipeline, what I want to do my own horn too much here, but we have become sort of the undisputed provider of the service to the enterprises, because we are really that good. We think that any enterprise thinking about offering buy now pay later, or pay monthly looks at Affirm as the gold standard. And we intend to provide those services to people like them. Always a terrible idea to pre-announce deals or pre announce deals that aren\u2019t closed, shouldn't really be coming to the pipeline. But certainly have extreme conviction that what we built resonates with folks that care about technology, scalability, availability, delivery of full suite of products, or the postal port solution. So in essence, I think the market is meeting us where we are with our suite of services. Again, I think it is important to say that as announced it is a test we are working very hard to make sure the test is successful. The reason companies have the scale and customer obsession, which, by the way, one reason why companies of this type, perhaps to this. Everything I said technology, risk management, conversion all of that is true, but at the very core it is with the end consumer. We want to deliver the best possible service. Sorry, I'm getting feedback that it's very hard to hear me. Is this any better? Sorry. I'll try to add more microphones too. So the punchline is we are obsessed with consumer delight. We want to make sure that we are driving sales, increasing conversion, improving the size of cards, all of that while being on the consumer side, without charging them late fees, without burying gotchas and fine print and things like that. And I think that is typically the cornerstone of our most successful partnerships. That is where these enterprise merchants that expect to live for hundreds of years and have lots of repeat transactions, they want to know that we will treat their consumers right that their consumer doesn't become just a footnote in chase for revenue, et cetera. So I think that that's really, really important. And that's where a lot of the relationships are forged, that's what we bring in. That's we take that very seriously. And certainly as do they. Sorry, I'll stop ranting. But the other thing, perhaps worth noting, I think that's the important thing here is I think the wave of the industry that I highlighted is what's driving a lot of these widgets as well. We are divested technology, we are really the most scalable provider here, as these very, very large retailers say, you know what, this isn't going away. It's not a cool feature. It's a real product. They look to us to provide. It's a great question. I'm honest, I think our job is to build exceptional product and maintain our leadership, both intellectually and at the product level. Enterprises, you inevitably run some level of concentration risk. I think we've demonstrated simply looking at Peloton that we're quite good at diversifying those concentration risks. So I can say, we don't know what to do about risks in general. But at the very core, our success depends on our ability to build great products and run it successfully at great unit economics, et cetera. So that\u2019s what we will do. Yeah, we think this product makes a lot of sense for consumers, first and foremost. And, at this point, the premier provider of the services to platforms of various kinds, we intend to bring products to market with them. And that is really important to us. But that's fueling a fair amount of our excitement here. That said, we very much care about smaller merchants. In fact, we are investing in areas of merchants self-service, making sure that we can bring someone live from near interest in Affirm to accepting transactions as quickly as possible. One of the core metrics we review literally every week is hey, how long did it take to go from an interested Affirm to take in first transaction and that's something that we are concentrated, minimize. It really matters for these little shops that do not have a legal team, and so on, and so forth. So we see ourselves as providers, not just to the very largest, but also to everyone, mid tail, long tail. All those are great customers. And frankly, the impact that we have on the long tail base is really staggering. That's where you can have share of cards that can number in sort of the staggering high double digit numbers. Now, we're so interested and so invested in these platinum partnerships, because a lot of them carry enormous amount of long tail. So building our service in a way that consumable and installable really easy, really high converting both at the consumer end, but at the really small merchant is really important to us. Merchants' self-service pipeline works really well by way of integrating with all the platforms, all the e-commerce platforms out there at this point. I can think of one where we're not supportive, but it also through these partnerships. And so we intend to go after every imaginable merchant out there, both online and also we have our design to offer. That's a great question. Sure, I can hit them all. But this is like, this was going to be awesome. It\u2019s a great set of questions. But I am tempering my excitement for the product because I know our lawyer watching. But it is hard to tempering, it\u2019s a great product. First of all, the use cases are that we envisioned is the one I've been testing the product more or less daily for the last month or two. And I bought an incredible amount of coffee, public service announcement do not buy pre ground beans. I buy all beans only, but it's in the tens of pounds at this point. That is my closest walk through for recognizing the debit card. And it's pretty cool. It works with my existing checking accounts. So when I do nothing, it just settled against that period of time. And when I feel like swiping left, turning into a pay-over-time transaction, that's what it does. And it's super smooth, very quick to physical card. So no different from one that your bank gave you. The expectation and the intent that we have for this product is that it really takes place as your top of wallet, primary transacting device, stepping back further and I'll allow myself a little bit of storytelling. One way of analyzing this whole BNPL revolution is actually is \u2013 there was like 100 million plus people that basically said, I'm just going to use my debit card because I don't understand credit cards, but I know they're good partners. And, those people can disagree, but I generally think decide that you put it all on a piece of plastic and then revolve then you pay interest on your lot size and your coffee beans. And your more expensive purchases, you're doing it wrong, like you shouldn't be paying interest in those things. And as a result that will these people basically said, yeah, I kind of get it, I don't have a better alternative. So I'm just going to live within my means and use my debit card. And every once in a while somebody like Affirm or one of our competitors would come along and say, hey, you're buying this thing, and it doesn't fit into your debit card budget, that's cool. You can use this every temper time solution that we've developed, it's available at the point of sale. That\u2019s what they call math Olympiad a partial solution, like, yeah, it's great, but you don't get full marks for that. What do you really want is a ubiquitous tool that allows you to say, hey, anytime I want to use a debit, I'm just going to use my debit. And anytime I want to turn it into a pay-over-time transaction, it's got to be very easy. It can't be harder than using a credit card. It has to be as simple and really, really convenient. And that's what we built with Debit+, and so that's the most important thing to understand.  We fundamentally connected the dots between this partial solution of buy now pay later at the point of sale, by moving into the hands of the end consumer built right into a debit card without asking them to change their accounts, et cetera. And so that's why I'm so jazzed about it, probably partially to do with just the sheer amount of coffee that I bought. But that's sort of part one. I would lie if I told you that I know exactly what's going to happen with all the different pertinent modalities et cetera. Still, in early beta, a lot of its consumers are telling us it's awesome. And we're learning a lot about how they're using this. But generally speaking, the goal is to delight the end customer.  And this is a big group of people that says, hey, I love the idea of having very tight control sense of financial responsibility and sanity by just paying for things with this really, really simple pay-over-time instruments, and mostly not. And what we have built is something that marries the two, really elegantly. That's what we're launching and sort of bringing to market. And over time, we think there's a lot of other cool stuff to add. And, I sort of use this software defined payments as a jargony thing that I came up with, but that's the idea. We will continue adding features to the card and the app by software updates. There'll be a lot of fun stuff to add to it. Not announcing any of those yet, but you can imagine how the output possibility. That's a really good question. So, again, without -- I realized I'm sounding a little bit like a child high in a pile of sugar, but I think this bed is busting it's pretty awesome. And we wanted to be the primary transactional device for our consumers. So the TAM is they're spend, 20 times a month on food and things like that. So it's shopping, or it's purchasing, whatever you call it. In that sense, we have infinite ambition. In terms of affiliate fees, I think the important thing there is, obviously we've done pretty well, we can sort of see that in our numbers or at least from our numbers there. We are not yet focused on that to be completely transparent. We're trying to build an amazing experience. We\u2019re trying to convince our consumers that this is a far better way of buying things. Over time, obviously, a tremendous value for our merchant partners or whoever our consumers choose to go to and shop, if we brought that customer to them, it's a service that we bundle, if you will, with the transaction itself. There's plenty of sort of advertising or marketing revenue to compete for there. But it served the -- that's part two. Part one is we want the consumer that picks up that across to say this is the best thing ever. I don't really need to use my real debit card anymore because this is better and I certainly don't have to touch my credit card ever again. That assuming we hit that \u2013 I was just going to say hit that out of the park, but I realized that I know what I'm talking about, again. Assuming we deliver on that I think affiliate fees will come. We'll start forecasting that as we measure the actual penetration. But the TAM itself is enormous. I'm afraid that's what tests are for to figure out the best presentation, best user interface and ultimately, we all know what works best. And then we're all here."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Thanks, Max, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another set of strong results to close out our fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, we accelerated year-over-year growth rate both GMV and revenue for the second consecutive quarter to 106% and 71%, respectively. Excluding our largest merchant Peloton, which saw GMV growth of over 328% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020, our fourth quarter GMV grew 178%. We also delivered strong unit economic, excluding the provision for credit losses revenue less transaction costs reached 7% of GMV. And even as we delivered these strong results, we continue to improve the capital efficiency of our business. The equity capital used to fund our loans decreased by another 19% to $178 million, despite more than doubling GMV and nearly doubling total platform portfolio. We also continue to deliver excellent credit performance. Our allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment declined to just 5.8% down from 9.2% last year, even as we expanded credit availability within our monthly installment in slip pay loan offer. And while we are pleased with the progress we've made in the fourth quarter, we are even more excited about how our product roadmap and recent merchant partnership set us up for another year of effective strong growth in the fiscal year ahead. I will discuss our financial outlook for the fiscal year \u201822 in a moment, but let me walk you through the key highlight of the fourth quarter first. Unless stated otherwise, all period to period comparative data refers to our fourth fiscal quarter of 2021 compared to our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020. Fourth quarter GMV grew 106% to $2.5 billion, exceeding our outlook. The momentum in GMV was stronger than categories leveraged to the reopening of the economy, while we began to anniversary the steep acceleration in the growth that categories have benefited from social distancing. For the first time, fashion and beauty was our largest category, thanks to our focus in expanding into lower AOV segments, while travel and ticketing continue to grow rapidly, contributing 14% of GMV, up from 9% in our fiscal third quarter of 2021. Owing to the strong growth of our business, merchant concentration continues to decline, as Peloton contributed 9% fourth quarter GMV compared to 32% in the prior year's fourth quarter. GMV growth came for both new and existing merchant relationships as well as our direct to consumer virtual card product. Merchant signed in fiscal year \u201821 delivered 15% of our fourth quarter GMV, excluding Paybright and Returnly. Merchants launched prior to fiscal \u201821 also grew quickly, delivering more than 100% dollar based merchant retention. And excluding Peloton, our GMV from these merchants grew 92% in fiscal Q4. Additionally, our non-integrated virtual card product grew 452% this quarter. More and more consumers are choosing the Affirm's honest and transparent payment alternatives. Broken active consumers, which we measure over the prior 12-month period accelerated, effectively doubling 7.1 million. Not only are we seeing strong growth in new consumers, we are also seeing encouraging trend among existing consumers. And while we've expanded into higher frequency and lower AOV category, transactions for active consumer has increased by 8% to 2.1% to 2.3%. At the end of the fourth quarter, active merchants, those merchants who have transacted on the platform over the prior 12-months, increased to almost 29,000 compared to just 5,700 in the prior year. Thanks in large part to our partnership with Shopify. Even though, Shop Pay Installment only became generally available to Shopify merchants in the last 20 days of the fiscal year and quarter. As Max indicated, with hundreds of thousands of merchants now unable to Shop Pay Installment, we're working closely with Shopify to drive consumer awareness and get even more consumers to try Shop Pay Installment. I would also note that the overall active merchant count includes roughly 3,000 incremental Paybright and Returnly merchants, following the close of those acquisitions in January and May, respectively. Turning to the mix of our offering, we derive 38% of GMV from our 0% APR product, down from 54% in the fourth quarter of 2020. While the GMV contribution from interest bearing products increased to 62% from 46% last year. The mix shift was primarily driven by the strong growth in categories like travel, which have fewer 0% merchants and the moderation of Peloton volume. Loans with a term length of greater than 12-months accounted for 22%, down from 43% last year. While AOV declined from $672 to $495, different by the same category mix shift. As Max noted, we continue to drive a large portion of our GMV on our platform to our merchant partners from our owned properties. In the fourth quarter, 29% transactions originated on Affirm's owned and operated property with 32% if you exclude Returnly and Paybright, Strong fourth quarter GMV also helped accelerate growth and revenue. Fourth quarter net revenue of $252 million grew 71% year-over-year, up from 57% in our fiscal third quarter, and 57% in our fiscal second quarter. These results reflect the diversity of our product offering, which enable us to deliver consistent revenue growth by giving merchants and consumers greater flexibility in terms, duration, and of course, purchase size. Our ability to offer a wide range of options is one of the many reasons why so many merchants, especially many in the retails largest enterprises, choose Affirm. That flexibility, including being able to pivot from 0% APR offers to interest bearing offers, has also enabled us to quickly adapt to major changes in the environment on behalf of our merchants over the past year and a half. Total network revenue grew 23% to $108 million in the fourth quarter. However, excluding Peloton, total network revenue grew 106%. As a percentage GMV total network revenue declined 300 basis points year-over-year, and was roughly consistent on a sequential basis and reflects our growth in our interest bearing products, especially in the travel category, and our direct to consumer virtual card product. Revenue as a percentage of GMV, our total revenue take rate was 10.5%, ahead of our expectation. While down versus last year, the overwhelming majority of the year-over-year change was due to the mix of loans originated on our platform. Last year's take rate also benefited from temporary increases in MDRs as certain high AOV merchants elected to pay increase MDRs in order to secure additional revenue in the early days of the pandemic. Excluding those two factors, revenue take rates were roughly stable year-over-year. Interest income grew 111% to $104 million. However, it is important to note 40% of the increase of interest income was driven by 212% year-on-year increase, and the amortization of the discount on loans held for investment on the balance sheet, rather than consumer interest payment. The portion of interest income related to consumer interest payments grew 77%, which is roughly in line with the total revenue growth reported in the period. Revenue from gain on sales loans of $43 million, increased from $12 million in the year ago quarter, as a result of more favorable loan sale pricing and the increase in the volume of loans we sold to third parties and our 2021 non-consolidated 0% securitization transaction. Finally, servicing income of $7 million increased from $5 million in the prior year, as the average unpaid principal balance of loans owned by third parties through year-end. Now turning to expenses, total transaction cost of $114 million came in better than our outlook of $135 million to $140 million in the fourth quarter. While transaction costs grew 149% year-over-year, nearly all of the increase was related to a $58 million year to year swing in the provision for credit losses, which I will discuss in a moment. Excluding the impact of provision we continue to drive the improvement in our unit economic. Transaction costs, excluding the provision for credit losses grew just 14% compared to the total revenue growth at 71%. Looking at the components of total transaction costs, loss on loan purchase commitment was $51 million, compared to $55 million in the prior year. Loss on loan purchase commitment directly correlated to the level of longer duration 0% APR GMV originated. Provision for credit losses was $25 million, compared to a gain of $32 million in the prior year, reflecting better than expected repayment, reduced stress multiples in the year ago quarter in the context of sizable loss allowance that was established at the end of the third fiscal quarter 2020, in the very early days of pandemic. Funding costs increased from $8 million to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, consistent with the growth of loans held for investment. The increase reflects the issuance of securitization trusts, which bear an interest at a fixed rate as well as an increase in average funding debt offset by a lower average interest rate. Finally, processing and servicing cost grew 48% to $22 million, despite platform portfolio growing at 88%, reflecting the ongoing scale efficiencies we are achieving. The combination of strong top-line performance and reduced transaction cost resulted in much better than expected revenue less transaction costs of $148 million, compared to our fourth quarter outlook of $80 million to $85 million. Looking beyond transaction costs to operating expenses, our strong growth in the fourth quarter enabled us to invest long-term growth of our business. Technology and data analytics expense, which is primarily composed of personnel expenses in our product and engineering organization grew 124% to $71 million. As a percentage of total revenue, technology and data analytics increased from 21% to 27%. However, excluding the impact of stock based compensation, technology and data analytics as a percent of revenue declined by 50 basis points compared to last year. The year-over-year cash increase in technology and data analytics was driven by higher engineering headcount dedicated to deliver the exciting slate of products and technology initiatives that Max discussed. Delta marketing expenses, which include both personnel and our marketing activity, increased from $5 million to $54 million, or from 3% to 24% total revenue. Majority of the dollar growth was driven by consumer branding to drive awareness and adoption, while SBC contributed $6 million of year-over-year increase, and the warrants we issued to Shopify in conjunction with our commercial agreement, contributed $17 million. General, administrative expenses increased from $31 million last year to $138 million, or from 21% to 53% of total revenue. However, excluding stock based compensation G&A was 21% of net revenue, compared to 19% in the year ago quarter. The cash increase in G&A was primarily the result of increased headcount to support the company's long-term growth and public company operation. Including these expenses, GAAP operating loss was $125 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to a GAAP operating income of $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Despite making these significant investments in our long-term growth, we delivered positive adjusted operating income. Adding back G&A, stock based compensation, the amortization of Shopify\u2019s warrant, and other one-time expenses, adjusted operating income was $14 million, compared to $47 million in the prior year, or 5.4% of total revenue. Turning to our balance sheet, we delivered triple digit GMV growth, while driving even more efficiency from a capital perspective. Total platform portfolio, which we define as the unpaid principal balance outstanding for all loans facilitated through our platform, including those loans owned by third-party increased $2.2 billion from June 30, 2020, $4.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Half of the $2.2 billion increase was funded on a non-consolidated basis through a combination of forward flow and our first unconsolidated securitization transaction. The rest was funded through consolidation, securitization, and warehouse facility. In terms of our overall funding mix, warehouse financing continued to shrink from $1.0 billion to $0.7 billion at June 30, 2021. We expect to fund future growth primarily through a combination of loan sales and securitization transaction, which continue to garner strong demand in the ABS market from a diverse array of large institutional investors. As alluded to previously, during the quarter, we successfully closed 2021 Z-1, our first unconsolidated securitization transaction. In addition, we recently issued our six ABS transaction 2021 B, at a very attractive financing terms, resulting in minimal equity capital required by Affirm. By establishing ourselves as a programmatic ABS issuer, the securitization, in conjunction with our committed forward flow agreements and warehouse facilities provide us with financial flexibility to support our GMV growth aspirations, by creating meaningful capacity to efficiently fund billions of dollars of loan with negligible incremental equity capital requirements. A material noteworthy results of our approach to funding optimization across these channels is the reduction of equity capital we use to fund our business. Equity capital required declined by 19% in the year ago quarter, from $221 million to $178 million, despite growing our loans and the balance sheet by $1 billion. Accordingly, as a percentage of total platform portfolio, equity capital required fell to below 4% from 9% in the year ago quarter. Now turning to the year ahead, we expect the strategic progress we made in the fiscal year 2021 and the accelerating consumer and merchant adoption of our offering will drive strong growth once again in fiscal year 2022. Before I dive in the numbers let me share some color on our outlook. After a year of explosive growth, we expect the moderation and Peloton GMV in fiscal Year 2022. Our Peloton business benefited from strong pandemic-related tailwind last year, as well as the introduction of new products, including the highly successful Bike+ [ph] and lower price Tread in September of 2020. Additionally, we have not included any GMV or revenue from the Amazon partnership we have recently announced. We are currently in the early stages of integration. We will update you on the progress and the incremental impact to our outlook each quarter. Finally, while we are very excited about the rollout of the Affirm Debit+ card, our outlook for fiscal year \u201822 also does not include a contribution from this new product. GMV and revenue from this new product would also the incremental to our outlook. With that context in mind, for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, we expect gross merchandise volume to increase between 50% and 54% from fiscal year \u201821, to between $12.45 billion to $12.75 billion. Excluding Peloton, we expect GMV growth of 70% to 75%. We also expect our split pay offering contribute 10% to 15% of our fiscal year 2022 GMV. The largest contributor of this volume coming from the Shop Pay Installment program. Importantly, we expect revenue of $1.16 billion to $1.19 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 33% to 37%. Owing to the ongoing mix shift, we expect modest contraction in total revenue as a percentage of GMV in fiscal year 2022, as implied in our outlook. Turning to expenses, we expect transaction costs of $605 million to $620 million. As a percentage of total revenue, we also expect modest deleverage in transaction cost as a percentage of revenue. As a result, we expect revenue less transaction cost of $555 million to $570 million. As Max said in his comment, we plan to deliver an exciting slate of consumer and merchant product offering in fiscal year 2022, as well as over the next several years. To drive the success of these initiatives, we are investing in engineering and product talent here in the United States, and deploying a new Engineering Center in Poland. As a result, we have significant investment in technology and data analytics in fiscal year \u201822. We're also increasing our spending and marketing to drive consumer awareness and adoption. Accordingly, we expect an adjusted operating loss of $145 million to $135 million. Finally, we expect weighted average shares of approximately $290 million for the year. For our first quarter ending September 30, 2021, we expect GMV to grow 64% to 67% to $2.42 billion to $2.52 billion. We expect that the growth to drive total revenue of $240 million to $250 million. Our outlook for the first quarter also contemplates transaction costs of $145 million to $150 million. Revenue less transaction costs of $95 million to $100 million, adjusted operating loss of $68 million to $63 million, and weighted average shares outstanding of $275 million. In closing, we have made another year of excellent progress on our mission to bring consumers and merchants together with honest financial product. Like Max, I'm extremely proud of the team's accomplishments over the last year. We are shaping the future of finance for the better. And every day more and more consumers and merchants are coming to Affirm for honest, transparent and delightful product experiences. I have never been more confident in our competitive position, nor more excited about the future that lies ahead. Here's to another year of the extraordinary achievements to come. And with that, we're happy to answer your questions. Yeah, I think there's a couple things to think about here. It has been higher recently, although we have benefited from continued improvement and credit outlook that has contributed nicely. When you look forward, as you model out the split pay low AOV business, you will see numbers coming down there just a start to the much smaller revenue base. So as a percentage of GMV you do have revenue less transaction costs of those transactions. We've indicated that we expect 10% to 15% of next year's number to be there. Over the longer term, we do expect that to continue to grow faster. And so I think we'd like to maintain the kind of longer term indication we've given everybody. That's right. Yeah. So the change in which income statement lines the revenue hits is very much a function of the product. So as we mix away from longer term 0% loan, you'll see loans that are coming into the interest bearing side, as we talked about, we did have a higher maximum interest bearing this quarter. And, when we put those on our balance sheet, we are an interest income. And when we tell them, we get the gain on sale, and you saw that big growth and gain on sale there. And the underlying reasons are related to the segments that saw the strongest growth. And so we had segments like travel and ticketing, which obviously, as early stages of the reopening saw explosive growth. But also we had our direct to consumer virtual card product, Affirm Anywhere, grow substantially. And that product has a little bit of virtual card network revenue, and then obviously, interest bearing activity behind it. And so really, it's the mix of products that shows up with driving those results. And as we've said many times before, we really don't look at or try to manage those deadlines, we target a total revenue number and try to deliver that. And we keep a keen eye on that revenue, less transaction cost number to make sure we're delivering really strong unit economics, that we can generate the revenue and generate the unit economics, the rest of itself sorts it out. Yeah, so we fund our business with now four different funding tools, securitizations that both get consolidated, and then our non-consolidated board flow and on the warehouse side. In our earning supplement, we show a pretty good breakdown of the funding mix by channel. And, the growth that you saw this quarter was predominantly in securitizations, but not consolidated and consolidated. When the securitization is consolidated, it does show up on the balance sheet as an asset, but it's really efficient. If you look at the last two deals we've done, we're kind of borrowing 97% or 98%, on average of the consumer balances, which is obviously just an extremely efficient way to fund it with respect to equity capital. But to answer your question, specifically around the market and the reaction and pricing around forward flow, it remains very strong. I think the demand for Affirm Paper in the market is really high. They desire the asset type, which is really short in duration. And they acknowledge that we've been really good at underwriting, and so they really liked the credit quality we can generate."

At this time, lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, we\u2019ll open the lines for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ron Clark, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nRon Clark: Thanks, operator. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone listening that today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the Company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them, except as required by law. In addition, today\u2019s call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. Hosting today\u2019s call are Max Levchin, Affirm\u2019s Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call. We\u2019re excited to update you on the performance of our business and the progress we achieved since our call in February. But before we go through the numbers, I would like to start by sharing a few stories from the past quarter to help demonstrate the power of Affirm. As many of you know, at Affirm, one of our core values is that people come first. That means that we constantly consider our impact on people\u2019s lives, and we strive to put their interest before our own. That\u2019s why we never charge late or hidden fees. It\u2019s also why we\u2019re always looking at what consumers have to say about us and how we\u2019re helping them get the things they want and need. In March, we celebrated Affirm\u2019s ninth birthday with a giveaway on Instagram. To participate, we asked consumers to share their favorite experience or purchase using Affirm. I was inspired by many of the more than 11,000 personal stories that were posted. One nurse thanked us for the affordable monthly payments that allowed her to buy a Theragun Prime massager, which helped soothe her aches and pains after a 12-hour shift during the pandemic. A mother of two thanked us for helping her take her family to Disney World just before her new baby arrived. She appreciated that she could book a special vacation without breaking the bank. I also frequently speak with merchants. Understanding their needs and how we help them achieve their goals is critical to establishing long-term partnerships. Recently, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with travel merchants in particular as they focus on meeting consumers\u2019 pent-up demand coming out of the pandemic. Thanks to Affirm, companies like Priceline, which we started partnering with in 2018, have added new customers. Priceline shared with us that their consumers are booking with greater confidence because of Affirm\u2019s flexible and gaucher-free payment solutions. They also shared that Affirm helps them expand their reach among millennial and Gen Z consumers. At the heart of the value we deliver to consumers and merchants is Affirm\u2019s unrivaled technology. The speed and accuracy of our technology allows us to instantly elevate consumers\u2019 requests and provide them with tailored payment options within seconds. And the quality and scalability of our technology has led large-scale platforms like Shopify to choose us as their partner. Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that more than 10,000 merchants have gone live with Shop Pay installments in just April and early May, and we expect this number to grow significantly when we move to general availability for new and existing merchants, which we expect to reach between now and the end of June. I will come back to the importance of our technology in a moment, but let me share an overview of our results for the third fiscal quarter. Affirm delivered another strong quarter that exceeded the financial outlook we provided in February. We more than doubled our active merchant count year-over-year to nearly 12,000. We accelerated year-over-year GMV growth to 83% from 55% in the second quarter. And excluding Peloton, our GMV grew 100%, up from 54% in the previous quarter. We also grew active consumers by 60% over the last 12 months. GMV growth was strong across all categories in the third quarter. This was driven primarily by consumer demand for Affirm\u2019s offerings as well as new and expanded relationships with merchants such as Ikon Pass, Neiman Marcus and Vrbo, among others. Categories that have fared well throughout the pandemic such as sporting goods, furniture and homewares continued to perform. Nearing the end of the quarter, we also began to see a sharp uptick in spending in categories that have been pressured by the pandemic. Travel and ticketing was particularly strong. GMV for the category nearly tripled for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and grew by more than 50% versus Q3 of last year, which was our pre-COVID quarterly high mark in travel. We are encouraged by this momentum and believe that the strengthening economy will provide another tailwind for Affirm. Americans have significant spending power coming out of the pandemic after paying down a record $83 billion in credit card debt and amassing $1.7 trillion in savings in 2020. The pandemic has also trained more shoppers to buy online, growing the U.S. e-commerce markets to nearly $800 billion. We expect this improved financial health, coupled with rising positive sentiment among consumers and the ongoing reopening, to support our continued growth. We look forward to being there for the consumers as they buy and use suit before returning to work, a wedding dress for the reception they put off or an airline ticket to see their missed loved ones. Our team also made excellent progress on our strategic objectives over the last few months. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are continuing to expand our presence into higher-frequency categories by activating our partnership with Shopify. Over the last several weeks, we have accelerated merchant onboarding, enabling Shop Pay installments by Affirm for more than 10,000 shop merchants, up from 100 merchants in our pilot that we shared with you back in February. We believe that scaling our partnership with Shopify will position us to grow our business with a large and diverse set of merchants. Shopify\u2019s team told us that Shop Pay Installments by Affirm has enabled them to offer a solution that will scale with their rapid growth and reduced buy now, pay later checkout times by as much as 30% for both new and returning users. We also expanded our platform by acquiring Returnly, a technology company that makes returns and exchanges seamless for both consumers and merchants. Today, Returnly helps more than 1,800 merchants increase return to repurchase rates, drive revenue from returns and elevate consumer satisfaction. We look forward to delivering returns with offerings to more merchants and introducing their more than 8 million users to Affirm. Before I turn the call over to Michael, let me briefly come back to my earlier point on our technology advantage. Affirm is a technology company, and we believe our technology is unparalleled among our competitors. We thrive on solving complex problems for both consumers and merchants that others can\u2019t or won\u2019t. The resulting technical expertise serves as an important competitive advantage. Leveraging our proprietary machine learning, we\u2019re able to personalize offers for consumers, more efficiently proven price credit and manage risk in ways that achieve better credit outcomes. As a result, we\u2019re able to offer more flexibility for consumers, allowing them to use Affirm across a range of price points and loan durations. These advantages differentiate us from buy now, pay later providers and other networks by allowing us to offer consumers much more than a short duration paid in for solution, which is critical in categories such as travel that have high transaction values. Our technology also enables us to drive measurable growth for our merchants. They see this in the volume of purchases we generate for them, increased conversion rates, higher average order values and incremental consumers. In fact, in the third quarter, approximately one-third of transactions were driven from Affirm\u2019s app and site. Our ability to consistently deliver strong results for our merchants is why so many large enterprises, including Walmart and Priceline, choose to partner with Affirm. Of course, great technology is ultimately about great technologists. In order to sustain and extend our advantage in technology, we\u2019re investing in the people behind it and elevating its leadership within the Company. As a part of that, we announced today that Libor Michalek, Affirm\u2019s President of Technology, has been appointed to our Board of Directors. Libor is one of the most highly-regarded technology minds in the fintech industry and has played a critical role in developing a proprietary technology platform that is a key competitive advantage for our business. Building world-class technology is critical to our strategy, and we\u2019re pleased to have Libor bring his significant software, systems, security, machine learning and engineering experience to our boardroom. Libor\u2019s appointment reflects our dedication to leveraging technology and innovation as competitive advantages that allow us to better deliver exceptional solutions for consumers and merchants at scale. Before I conclude, let me briefly turn to some additional leadership updates. Today, we announced that our Chief Legal Officer, Sharda Caro Del Castillo, has decided to step down from her role at Affirm. Sharda led our legal team during a critical time for our Company as we conducted our IPO, navigated an unprecedented market period and achieved tremendous growth. I want to thank her for her dedication and leadership. She\u2019s been a trusted and valued counselor to me and our whole leadership team, and we wish her all the best. Katherine Adkins will be assuming the role of Chief Legal Officer. Katherine has been one of Sharda\u2019s deputies, an integral part of our senior legal team and taken on increased responsibility while supporting the important legal needs of the Company. She will play a critical role as we continue to expand the ubiquity of our platform, strengthening, scaling and growing Affirm for the long term, and we\u2019re grateful to have her as a part of our leadership team. In summary, we had a strong third quarter and we made excellent progress on our strategic goals. We\u2019re seeing strengthening momentum in our business as consumers and merchant adoption continues to grow, and we believe Affirm is uniquely positioned to capture the large and growing opportunity in front of us. None of this will be possible without the hard work of Affirmers. They have delivered excellent results through the pandemic, provided exceptional service to our consumers and merchants, welcomed PayBright and Returnly teams to the Affirm family and prepared us for success as a public Company. I couldn\u2019t be more proud and appreciative of Affirmers\u2019 focus and dedication on behalf of our consumers, our merchants and our shareholders. Together, we have accomplished a lot, but we\u2019re really just getting started. And with that, I will turn it over to Michael to take you through the details of the third quarter and share our outlook for the fourth quarter.\nMichael Linford: Thanks, Max, and good afternoon, everyone. As Max noted, we had a strong third quarter. GMV and revenue exceeded our financial outlook, growing 83% and 67%, respectively, and accelerating from the year-over-year growth rates we achieved in the second quarter of 2021. We delivered on this growth with significantly greater capital efficiency, reducing equity capital required by 10% compared to the prior year period, despite growing the balance sheet by more than 100%. We also delivered stronger credit performance with our allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment declining to a record low of 5.2%. These trends are encouraging, and we remain focused on building on this momentum as we move forward. I\u2019ll now walk you through some of the key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook, which we are raising today to reflect the strong performance of the business. Unless otherwise stated, all period-to-period comparative data refers to our third fiscal quarter of 2021 compared to our third fiscal quarter of 2020. Third quarter GMV grew 83% to $2.3 billion, exceeding our outlook for $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion. The increase was driven by strong merchant and consumer adoption across all categories. As of the end of the third quarter, active merchants more than doubled to nearly 12,000 while active consumers, which we measure over the prior 12-month period, increased 60% to 5.4 million. Transactions per active consumer also rose from 2.1 to 2.3. While GMV exceeded our outlook, the momentum of the business was even stronger than the 83% headline growth indicates. Excluding Peloton, the third quarter GMV doubled, driven by growth across all categories that Affirm serves as well as from both new and existing merchant relationships. The broad-based category growth also served to diversify merchant concentration as Peloton, where fulfillment lead times improved, outpacing our expectations, represented 18% of third quarter GMV compared to 25% a year ago. As Max indicated, travel was the real highlight among our verticals, even though its takeoff began late in the quarter. Travel accounted for just 2% of September quarter GMV but has steadily grown to 9% in the March ending quarter. In April, travel growth continued to accelerate, taking its proportion of GMV to 11% of the Company-wide total. Given the investments in partnerships we\u2019ve made in the category, we expect travel to contribute meaningfully in the fourth quarter and beyond. Our 0 APR business accounted for 43% of our total GMV, consistent with the third quarter 2020. Loans with a term length of greater than 12 months accounted for 30%, down from 35% in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting our expanded merchant base and higher velocity and lower average order value categories. Accordingly, AOV also declined slightly from $612 to $564. The strong momentum in GMV growth in the third quarter translated into revenue growth that also exceeded the expectations we shared with you in February of $185 million to $195 million. Third quarter net revenue of $231 million increased 67%, driven by total network revenue, which grew 53% to $112 million and interest income which grew 80% to $95 million. Roughly one-third of interest income was driven by the amortization of the discounts on loans held for investment on the balance sheet rather than from consumer interest payments. The portion of interest income related to consumer interest payments grew more slowly, up 42% year-to-year. Revenue from gain on sale loans of $16 million increased from $10 million in the year-ago quarter as a result of more favorable loan sale pricing terms and more volumes sold. Finally, servicing income of $8 million increased from $3 million in the prior year as the average unpaid principal balance of loans owned by third parties grew year-over-year. I\u2019d like to call out that our Q3 results include a $3.5 million reduction to total revenue, which we recorded in relation to the estimated financial impact to Affirm of Peloton\u2019s announced voluntary recall of their Tread and Tread+ products. This reduction is split between $3.1 million in merchant network revenue and $0.4 million in interest income. The estimate was based on projected return rates provided by Peloton for the quarter ending June 30, 2021, in its most recent quarterly filing. We continued to improve our unit economics in Q3, growing revenue 67% of all transaction costs, excluding the provision for credit losses, grew 50%. Transaction costs, including the provision for credit losses in the third quarter, were $97 million, a 34% year-over-year decrease. Third quarter results included an $83 million decrease in the provision for credit losses versus 2020. Transaction costs, excluding the provision for credit losses, were $98 million, up $33 million or 50% from the third quarter 2020, significantly slower than revenue growth. Loss on loan purchase commitment was $62 million compared to $44 million in the prior year, driven by the increased volume of 0% APR loans. Provisions for credit losses was a gain of $1 million compared to an expense of $82 million in the prior year, reflecting the reduction in allowance to a record low of 5.2% of loans held for investment. Last year, we took an incremental $56 million provision in anticipation of record unemployment, which has been released over time as we have been experiencing stronger-than-expected repayment history in the portfolio. The reduced allowance that I mentioned reflects materially better estimates on future loan losses and is consistent with our strong credit performance. Additionally, due to our loss of emerging growth company status, we also adopted the CECL accounting standard retroactive to July 1, 2020, which did not have a material impact on provision for credit losses in this period. Funding costs increased from $8 million to $15 million in the third quarter of 2021 but grew slower than loans held for investment. The increase reflects the issuance of securitization trusts, which bear interest at a fixed rate as well as increased average funding debt offset by the lower average interest rates. Finally, processing and servicing were $21 million, up from $14 million in the year-ago quarter but grew slower than total platform portfolio as we realized scale efficiencies. The combination of strong top line performance and reduced transaction costs resulted in better-than-expected revenue less transaction cost of $134 million compared to our third quarter outlook for $60 million to $65 million. Looking beyond transaction costs to our investments to drive long-term growth, there was a meaningful impact this quarter from stock-based compensation primarily related to the January IPO. Technology and data analytics expense grew 193% to $99 million or from 24% to 43% of net revenue, primarily reflecting SBC and higher engineering headcount as we worked to extend our competitive advantage and technology that Max noted previously. Excluding SBC of $46 million, technology and data analytics expense grew 74% compared to the year-ago quarter. Sales and marketing expense increased from $7 million to $58 million or from 5% to 25% of net revenue, primarily as a result of SBC and the vesting of awards granted to Shopify associated with our exclusive long-term partnership. Excluding SBC of $10 million and the impact of Shopify warrants of $17 million, sales and marketing expense grew by $25 million compared to the year-ago quarter. General and administrative expense increased from $31 million last year to $147 million or from 23% to 64% of net revenue, due in part to an increase in the finance, legal, operations and administrative headcount to support the Company\u2019s long-term growth and public company operations. G&A also included an $11 million sublet impairment relating to our changing real estate footprint in light of our remote first policy. Excluding SBC of $82 million, which includes $38 million associated with the grant of multiyear performance-based stock options to our Chief Executive Officer, G&A expenses grew 132% compared to the year-ago quarter. Including these expenses, GAAP operating loss was $169 million in the third quarter of \u201821 compared to an $82 million in the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted operating income, which excludes depreciation and amortization of $5 million, stock-based compensation of $140 million, the Shopify warrants of $17 million and other nonrecurring items of $13 million, was $5 million, a $76 million improvement from the adjusted operating loss of $71 million in the year-ago period. As a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating margin increased 53 points from the third quarter of 2020 and was 2%. We continue to deliver on our strategy to grow our business while being very efficient with our equity capital. On the growth side, total platform portfolio, which includes the unpaid balance of all loans facilitated through our platform, including those loans held by third parties, grew from $2.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, to $4.2 billion at the end of the third quarter or $1.8 billion of year-to-year growth. This $1.8 billion in growth was funded by $1.3 billion in securitization volume and $552 million in forward flow volume while we were relatively flat year-on-year with the on-balance sheet we\u2019re having. On the funding side, in our third quarter, we executed a 2021-A revolving securitization in addition to a new warehouse facility and new loan sale program. These deals allowed us to efficiently scale our program. Despite growing our loans in the balance sheet by $1.2 billion, we were able to reduce the equity capital required from the year-ago quarter by 10% from $229 million to $207 million. As a percentage of total platform portfolio, equity capital required fell to 5% from approximately 10% in the year ago quarter. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the momentum in our business, and we believe the strengthening of the overall economy will serve as a tailwind in the fourth quarter. We are seeing GMV growth across all categories, particularly those hardest hit by the pandemic as demand recovers. We are also encouraged by the strong consumer and merchant adoption we saw in the third quarter. Reflecting these dynamics, we are raising our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. For our fourth quarter ending June 30, 2021, we expect GMV of $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; revenue of $215 million to $225 million; transaction cost of $135 million to $140 million; revenue less transaction cost of $80 million to $85 million; and adjusted operating loss of $55 million to $50 million; and a weighted average share count to 270 million. As I noted a moment ago, we recorded a $3.5 million reduction to revenue in Q3, which represents the estimated direct revenue impact from Peloton\u2019s Tread and Tread+ recall. While we do not expect any additional revenue impact from the refunded merchant fees in Q4, we do expect an increase in returns starting in the near term, which will negatively impact key operating metrics like GMV. Our financial outlook takes into account this estimated GMV impact associated with the refunds as well as an estimated impact on lower future Tread and Tread+ GMV. Additionally, our outlook includes the impact from the acquisition of Returnly, which we closed on May 1st but do not expect to be material in Q4. For our fiscal year 2021 ending June 30, 2021, we now expect GMV of $8.01 billion to $8.06 billion, revenue of $824 million to $834 million; transaction cost of $460 million to $465 million; revenue less transaction cost of $364 million to $369 million; adjusted operating loss of $55 million to $50 million; and a weighted average share count of approximately 160 million. The full year guidance and the fiscal year-to-date financials include the impact of the adoption of CECL retroactive to July 1, 2020. This adoption resulted in a $16 million downward revision to the previously reported provision for credit losses for the first half of fiscal \u201821 as a result of the reduction in allowance. In closing, we had a strong third quarter. Consumers are adopting our product in greater numbers and our merchant partners are seeing real growth enabled by our product offering, and we believe the best is yet to come. We are delivering on our mission to improve lives with honest financial products while also delivering results for our shareholders. With that, we\u2019re happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Perlin: Thanks, guys, and good evening. I just wanted to kind of make sure I understand all these dynamics that are at play here. In particular, the merchant take rate in the quarter dropped and it looks like it\u2019s implied to kind of stay at these levels in the June quarter. I\u2019m assuming some of that has to do with maybe Peloton and also bringing on Shop Pay Installments. But if you could maybe help with that dynamic first, that would be very helpful.\nMichael Linford: Yes. So, when looking at merchant fee revenue, the first thing is really important to sum up both the merchant network revenue and the virtual card network revenue lines. In particular, the virtual card network revenue is a key way we collect merchant fees from our travel merchants. So, as travel continues to gain in importance, it\u2019s an important line to look at in combination. And then, yes, the biggest impact\u2019s around just the total take rate, which was actually in line with our expectations, is the mix away from longer-term 0% loans, notably Peloton, which declined in concentration.\nDan Perlin: Okay. So, are you implying that -- I know you don\u2019t want to go out to 2022 guidance at this point, but it would -- I feel like the models were set previously to be closer to 500-plus basis points in the 2022 period, and this is kind of suggesting that that may be accelerating on the downtrend here. So all I\u2019m trying to, I guess, ultimately get to is, is your expectation that Shopify is going to meaningfully increase the GMV to help offset that? Or is this kind of the run rate that we should be thinking about even when we combine both the virtual card and the merchant network as we think about jumping on to next year? Thank you.\nMichael Linford: Yes. We\u2019re not going to give any guidance into 2022 right now. But the only other thing I\u2019d add is, there\u2019s a small impact from, obviously, a $3.5 million number you see in Peloton this quarter and then the interest income dynamic, which definitely affects the merchant fee recognition is also at play here. But we wouldn\u2019t expect there to be a material change from -- on the merchant -- total merchant revenue side from the impact of Shopify.\nDan Perlin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, guys, and thank you for taking my question this evening. I wanted to ask about the travel and ticketing vertical. It really seems to be enjoying a pretty rapid recovery, candidly more rapid than I would have expected, given the state of the world right now. It\u2019s up at about 9% in the quarter of total GMV and I think you said 11% in April. Where can we see that go? Do you think this vertical will become a larger percentage of your business, presuming that there\u2019s still plenty of runway for the travel recovery to kind of play out?\nMax Levchin: Yes. So, first of all, you\u2019re totally right. Traveling and ticketing is seeing what could only be described as a resurgence. So, if you look at the comparison to last year, fiscal Q3, which was a high pre-COVID quarterly market, it\u2019s really important to note that in general, we are comparing in this quarter to kind of a pre-COVID Affirm because obviously COVID changed everything. But the growth even versus that number was 50% that we\u2019re coming off from a essentially collapsed base. Now, if you sort of zoom in and look at what\u2019s happening right now, the month-to-month growth is nearly tripled. And so, it\u2019s just an unbelievable resurgence, very, very quickly in that space. And we\u2019re very excited about it is. We\u2019re very well-positioned. We have all kinds of exciting partners in the places like Ikon Pass, Vrbo, accounts like Expedia, Priceline, some of these folks have been with us for a very long time, like other new partner and then, of course, Delta Vacations, American Airlines, our enormous partner as well. And so, we\u2019re very well positioned in the space. It actually speaks a little bit to the fact that we\u2019re quite unique among our BNPL brethren in a sense that we play in both low and high-ticket items, and obviously sort of pent-up demand for just getting out of town and going somewhere nice implies higher ticket values and we have to provide our services for both multi-hundred dollar and multi-thousand dollar tickets there. So, we do very well with all of those. So, I think, I\u2019ll let Michael opine on exactly what we might want to guide to. But the overall economic recovery is just huge in the travel ticketing space, and we are super well positioned to benefit. We\u2019re starting to see all the investments that we made over the last year just setting up for this recovery really pay off.\nRamsey El-Assal: That\u2019s terrific. And I also wonder if I could ask you to give us a little more color on the Returnly acquisition, sort of how it fits into your broad strategy, maybe a bit on revenue synergies and an annualized contribution to the P&L just so we can kind of figure out how to model it next year.\nMax Levchin: I\u2019ll let Michael speak to the modeling part of this, since that\u2019s certainly his headache. But in terms of the value to us, it\u2019s an amazing synergy. If you think of it sort of from the product point of view, Returnly literally picks up where Affirm leaves off. So, if you look at -- we bring the consumer to the checkout counter with the confidence and certainty that they will be able to afford this, there\u2019ll be no fees. There\u2019ll be total transparency in pricing, often go and they\u2019re happy to buy. And what will happen if the shoe doesn\u2019t fit or if they don\u2019t quite like the color, they need it exchanged. And up until the Returnly acquisition, Affirm said, well, great, we\u2019ll be a really nice clean refund process for you. But once the merchant restocks and refunds, then you can come back and shop. And we always saw that as just a huge opportunity for us to step in and say, well, what if we know a customer well enough to allow them to shop even before they put the unwanted item in a box, so that they can accelerate commerce for them to get their satisfaction that much faster and help merchants just move the inventory that much quicker? And so, we saw this long enough ago as we actually invested in Returnly. So, this is not an old friend. We would track it and see progress for a very long time. We\u2019re proud investors and something to realize that the synergies were too great to let them be too far away from us and completed the acquisition. And you will see just an incredible amount of synergies. First and foremost, from the point of view of going to markets, when we speak to merchants, we\u2019ve heard the question, what do you do about returns? Often of our standard answer has always been, well, we\u2019ll be your best return handling partner because consumers love us. We don\u2019t charge fees. There\u2019ll be no hidden gadget. Now, of course, we can augment by saying, \"actually, we\u2019ll make it even better, before they even have to put the unwanted item in a box, we will be there, they can start shopping right away and help you sell more. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about this and it\u2019s just close so we have a ton to bring to market together. We have a massive network of users. 8 million people have used Returnly successfully, and that\u2019s another shift for our products on the Affirm side, and there\u2019s much more work to do together. I don\u2019t know, Michael, if you want to comment on how to account for the revenue opportunities.\nMichael Linford: Yes. We haven\u2019t disclosed any revenue or profitability for Returnly. We will update you guys in September. What I would note now though is they do have two different revenue streams. They do charge a SaaS model for most of the merchants who use the product, which we think adds stickiness and adds into the fight in the low AOV space. And they also as an underwriting component, a risk-taking component, if you think about what the process that Max just outlined. We think we can add a lot of value to that, both on the cost side as well as in bringing that product to our existing merchant base.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Sounds like a great fit. I appreciate you taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Neill with Goldman Sachs.\nMatt O\u2019Neill: I was just curious if you could help articulate a little bit better a couple of sort of time lines for rollouts. So, I was just curious, in the next couple of months, what\u2019s going to allow the 100 merchants on Shopify that is now at 10,000 merchants get up to much broader distribution? Is that on your side or Shopify\u2019s side or both? And then, similarly, I found the card announcement, very exciting and understand that that will be a later in the year kind of launch. But just again, kind of curious what the milestones are on that as far as getting closer to a broader launch. Thanks.\nMax Levchin: Yes. That\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019m afraid I have to update the Shopify number for you. Just since the last we added the press release, the number went up to 12,500. So, we got -- this is not a forward-looking statement. I don\u2019t know how quickly it will grow, but obviously, it\u2019s growing pretty quickly. So just to give you a quick breakdown of what\u2019s happening at Shopify. So, first of all, we\u2019re obviously super excited that we\u2019re finally here. GA for this product will be available sometime in June. And that means that every new Shopify merchant coming on to the platform will have Shop Pay Installments powered by Affirm enabled automatically. And so, we\u2019ll just see, we think, a tremendous amount of uptake on the merchant side. Now, because Shopify is not exactly a small network, in fact, there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of merchants that are eligible for Affirm\u2019s products or collaborative product together, we have been pre-approving and inviting existing merchants onto the platform, and that\u2019s where these sort of scaling numbers are coming from. We\u2019re far from done there. And so, we expect this number to continue growing not linearly. And I have very little prediction as to how fast it will go, but there\u2019s a lot more to add to this 12,500. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening on the Shopify side of things. Very excited about where that\u2019s headed. Lots and lots more to do together as well, so we worked very long and hard. One cool stat about Shopify, I just wanted to make sure that we\u2019re honest when we offer this product to the merchants by way of being, in fact, better as opposed to just an exclusive partner. And so, we had timed the time to complete a transaction using Shop Pay Installments powered by Affirm versus all the other competing products that you may encountered in a while. In both new and existing customers, we\u2019re at least 30% faster in converting. So, not do we only have a prime placement of this product, we also are, in fact, offering the very best product in the market. And so, I think that\u2019s a fairly powerful endorsement on the platform. Card, so, some of you have met us during our testing the waters process before we went out to actually do a initial public offering. It\u2019s roughly what I wanted to do with the card announcement. It\u2019s very different. And I agree that\u2019s very exciting, but it\u2019s easy to get excited about what\u2019s going on in your own head without getting confirmation from consumers. So, we announced the product primarily to see what would happen to our wait list? Would we find ourselves surrounded by yawns or people actually saying, wow, that\u2019s the most exciting thing that\u2019s hit the news cycle in the world that already pretty exciting fintech. Very happy to report that the wait list is of excellent length from my vantage point, and we\u2019re very excited to bring this product to market. But it\u2019s all in good time. We\u2019re going to let out this year.\nMatt O\u2019Neill: Okay, got it. Thanks. And maybe just one real quick follow-up. Would you be willing to help us at all think through the composition of next quarter\u2019s guidance, specifically with respect to the provision just because that\u2019s been a line of outperformance in the two quarters as a public company? Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll jump back in.\nMichael Linford: Yes. The last two quarters have seen pretty large releases. We do think that\u2019s behind us now. If you look at the allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment at 5.2%, think that\u2019s in the Zip code of a pretty safe number but not something we would see materially decline from here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Congratulations on all the forward progress that you talked about with Shopify. And just wondering if you could kind of just help us understand how those customers will kind of relate to the Affirm ecosystem. Are they going to be customers just of that kind of your venture with Shopify or will they be part of the Affirm -- will they get an Affirm account, and will you be able to continue marketing to them?\nMax Levchin: So, I guess, the easiest thing to serve -- to make it extremely black and white is that you will be able to service your Shop Pay Installments loan either inside the Shop app or its idea for an app. So, I think that should give you sort of quite a lot of the answer. There\u2019s a lot of user interface details that have to be read. And so, if we see the customer again together with Shopify within the broader Shopify ecosystem, which is quite a big at this point, of course, it\u2019s very easy to recognize them within the Shop Pay environment. We have a prime placement there and that will be the smoothest experience possible. If and when we find this customer outside of a Shopify ecosystem, we want to make sure we don\u2019t sort of say, freak them out by saying, hey, we\u2019ve met you before. So, how do you go, you\u2019re signed up. But that kind of experience as well will be extremely smooth and they\u2019ll be able to reaffirm their identity, if you will, and could become -- be able to use our services on any other merchant. So, there\u2019s a slight difference between all those paths, but they\u2019re all designed to be extremely simple. The most important thing that\u2019s really worth understanding is that the underwriting cost, the data associated with the customer provisions, all the things that we have to do to make sure that this customer is, in fact, someone we are willing to take the risk with happens in that first transaction. And so, there\u2019s just an enormous synergies financially as well as from user interface point of view as we bring these customers on board.\nMoshe Orenbuch: And then, clearly, then you\u2019d be able to, even in some form, be able to kind of -- or maybe, I guess ask, would you be able to reach out to them at that point and kind of invite them? Is that something that\u2019s possible?\nMax Levchin: I think, depending on the circumstances, I think there\u2019s probably a little bit more nuance to the answer than yes, but if you have doubt, we have no intention of spamming Shopify customers, if that\u2019s the underlying question. That\u2019s not happening.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Certainly encouraging to see the recovery in travel and ticketing. Can you kind of just juxtapose that with any other changes in card-present behavior you see from consumers in reopening? In other words, is there any shift in consumer behavior in e-comm that might otherwise temper a very strong recovery in that central category where there seems to be a lot of pent-up demand?\nMax Levchin: So, I think there\u2019s a lot of different strands going on. So, in general, we see the economic recovery as a huge tailwind for us, and there\u2019s a bunch of different things that are connected to it. And some of it is in travel and ticketing category, which just sort of coiled up and is now rapidly spitting up as people are able to travel finally to see their loved ones. There\u2019s also all kinds of subcategories that may not naturally go to immediately but they are quite large and are happening. For example, 97% of old weddings got postponed and only 5% of that got canceled. So, there\u2019s a lot of people that need to buy relatively expensive bridal dresses and also some other things. And again, playing in the high-ticket items as well as low-ticket items really positions us well for these sorts of affordable luxuries as well as everyday expenses. And so, we see a lot of demand in all these categories that just kind of took a break during 2020, if you will. That said, we are not seeing a reduction in demand in fashion and in home, fitness, outdoor. All the different categories where Affirm has traditionally been very, very strong are in fact continuing strong. If you actually, again, look at the sort of the pre-pandemic comparison we have in this quarter, ex-Peloton, we grew 100%, which is a pretty massive acceleration from the quarter prior. So, we effectively, not quite, but almost doubled the second derivative of growth here. And that is already as the recovery began, still from a small base, but the demand for this product is what\u2019s driving our growth. It\u2019s less the sort of trade-off from category to category. So, we\u2019re very excited about all of these things and obviously have to. I believe it will be there in all those places as the demand spins up.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And with regard to card-present generally, as you think about that category, can you update us on your thoughts and how important the card is going to be to growth in card-present and what the trajectory might look like?\nMax Levchin: I was actually -- I was trying to figure out what you meant by card-present. So now, I get it. So, slight step back, but it could be important for us to provide what sometimes known as the omnichannel solutions especially for our largest partners. We have a very large long-term partnership with Walmart that\u2019s been very successful. A lot of our larger enterprise customers are now setting up for completely new modalities of interacting with their consumers, buy in store, return online, buy online, return in store. So, all these different new modes of transacting is a thing, and it\u2019s really important that we are able to meet the consumers where we are. In part, our card strategy we think is kind of one of the best reengagement techniques we have to offer to our consumer. If Affirm is something that you love and our net promoter score speaks for itself, if we are in your wallet, be it on a screen or in your actual physical wallet, we\u2019ll have a chance to remind you that you can use Affirm pretty much everywhere you go. And so, we think of our card strategy and overall omnichannel strategy in store and out of store as a sort of continuous landscape of just being where the customer is and making sure, in this case, the end consumer is making sure that we\u2019re able to meet their demands.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: You mentioned that some of the take rate compression came from, I guess, Peloton and its 0%, coming down as part of your mix. Did you see any pulling back from other merchants from their own 0% promotions that may have also impacted that at all? And I\u2019m wondering, as the mix changes, maybe to a little bit more interest-bearing, how we should think about that impacting customer acquisition, et cetera?\nMichael Linford: Yes. We did not actually see a big change in terms of 0%. I mean, I think the biggest driver is that long-term 0% program with Peloton, which clearly did come down in total. But otherwise, I think the 0% business was flat year-on-year for the same period. So, we didn\u2019t see a pullback on 0% programs generally, and I think the biggest impact was from Peloton specifically.\nMax Levchin: In fact, 0% outside of Peloton accelerated.\nJames Faucette: Got it, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then separately, like you kind of highlighted or called out what you expect to the revenue impact from expected returns to be associated with the Tread products. Do you think that will be fully captured -- or that program will be fully captured in the June quarter, or is that do you think going to spill beyond the June quarter into the second half of the calendar year or the first half of your fiscal year?\nMichael Linford: Yes. So, we used Peloton\u2019s guidance in their Q around the $50 million estimated return volume, and we\u2019re a certain percentage of that. And we -- that\u2019s how we got to our $3.5 million number that was actually in the fiscal Q3. So, we don\u2019t anticipate there to be any impact in fiscal Q4 associated with further refunds. I also thought it would be important to put in context that Peloton return number. We\u2019ll do a couple of hundred million dollars in returns in any given quarter. So, for us, this is a much smaller impact than 1 might think from the outside.\nJames Faucette: Got it, got it. And so, just to be clear on that, Michael if -- however, returns vary from their estimate, like there could be some future small adjustments to account for that then?\nMichael Linford: Yes, exactly. But, we don\u2019t anticipate that to be material. I mean, when we take even the bulk of that is the $3.5 million number, which again was recorded in Q3. So, this should not be an impact in Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. I just wanted to start with a follow-up question on Shopify, and I\u2019m just wondering how much GMV and/or revenue within the Q4 guide there. And just any color on consumer uptake of Affirm/Shop Pay Installment that you\u2019ve seen so far among the merchants that have gone live.\nMax Levchin: I\u2019ll let Michael speak to the guidance but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re giving it. But, I think it\u2019s a little bit early to speak to the deck numbers, just given the fact that literally, the 10,000 number -- 12,500 number that we quoted, all of this happened in less -- the last 30 days, just to make sure I\u2019m not perjuring myself there. And so, there is -- it\u2019s a very, very rapidly increasing merchant base. We\u2019ll be able to speak a little bit more clearly as to what this actually means in terms of volume and in terms of consumer adoption. Obviously, we spent nearly a year testing the product, making sure it\u2019s much faster than competition, much better converting -- competitive in and of itself and better positioned than the competition. But we\u2019ll -- we have very high hopes for what that actually means in terms of volume generation, but we\u2019ll speak to real numbers as we have them.\nJason Kupferberg: Yes. Okay\u2026\nMichael Linford: Very specifically for Q4, the focus is getting to GA so that the impact we would expect to be more material in fiscal \u201822.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. So, you think maybe next quarter, we\u2019ll get a sense on what your expectations are for \u201822 from Shopify?\nMichael Linford: Yes.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And then, just a follow-up question. I\u2019m wondering what trends you guys are seeing just in terms of both consumers and merchants adopting more than 1 BNPL provider and what you think the implications over time might be for industry consolidation.\nMax Levchin: Definitely hard to speak to industry consolidation since that doesn\u2019t include us. We think we\u2019re the best. But obviously, everybody has a bias for their own. That said, I think last quarter, I said something on the lines of we expect low AOV to have ultimately capacity to offer multiple providers integrated, while higher AOV probably trends to one provider. I think that\u2019s still true. I would say that the momentum towards multiple providers at a single low AOV merchant has not been quite as quick as I\u2019d anticipated, while the ability to retain an ability to serve high AOV merchants has been even stronger than I thought. I think the complexity of both technical and risk management on the higher AOV sort things, that\u2019s what we consider to be our core vantage. That\u2019s very real and it\u2019s very hard for our competitors to speak credibly in that area at all. On the low AOV side of things, I think the -- again, I believe that ultimately, brands will have one or two, maybe three providers. It\u2019s a little bit early. There\u2019s so much growth available in every sub-segment. In low AUV, it\u2019s fundamentally fashion, beauty, some of this are lower -- hard goods, low-cost hard goods. And at the moment, there\u2019s so much demand just looking at the numbers that I just quoted on Shopify. It\u2019s pretty clear that there\u2019s an enormous amount of pent-up demand on the merchant side. And so, at the moment, the competitive overlap is not yet a major topic on our minds. But we\u2019ll report back in a quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Seaport Global.\nChris Brendler: I wanted to ask about merchant adoption of buy now, pay later. I look at your Affirm app and all the merchants that are in there that currently don\u2019t have it on their checkout screens or website. And it just feels like with the consumer adoption starting to gain traction, can you give us a little insight on where you think we are in terms of merchant adoption, especially in the travel space? It seems like you got some great numbers in travel this quarter, but there\u2019s a lot of travel sites that don\u2019t have buy now, pay later yet. So, maybe give your thoughts there. Thanks.\nMax Levchin: I agree. That is why we have a sales team. They are very hard at work. It\u2019s their problem. So I\u2019ll give you a more serious answer. So, in our app, and it -- actually even -- there\u2019s multiple ways we collaborate with merchants. One of them, obviously, is the -- embedded at the point of sale, sort of classic buy now, pay later or pay in 6 day and 12, whatever the merchant\u2019s suite that we offer at checkout that makes sense for this particular price point. Beyond that, there\u2019s our approximately, and in our app, you can be listed whether you\u2019re integrated or not. The way we get competition from merchants for driving these new incremental transactions, which are very, very powerful, by the way, for them, their impact more valuable than consumers that we help close at the point of sale. These customers actually are starting their shopping journey in our app and are going to a point of sale at a merchant. In those situations, merchants quite frequently will pay us essentially a bounty or a referral bonus for bringing this consumer to them. And then, within the app itself, we have quite a lot -- and by the way, when I say the app, I use it interchangeably with our sites. A fair amount of our consumers use our sites just perhaps because they prefer the larger screen format. But in both those cases, those are potentially advertising opportunities for our merchant partners to bring their offers, new products, et cetera, to the Affirm ecosystem. And so, in all those situations, there is a financial relationship with the merchant. Sometimes, the merchant doesn\u2019t have Affirm integrated at the point of sale yet. They may have already signing agreement, and we are waiting for the technical teams to become available. Part of what we pride ourselves on is this ability to be live here very quickly. We have a variety of integration modalities. We have this thing that we\u2019ve really been leading into, called, Affirm Lite, [ph] which allows merchants to go live literally within minutes of signing a contract. But there\u2019s many different modalities of integration. Sometimes, it\u2019s going high, that\u2019s when sometimes you\u2019ll find us promoting a merchant in our app and yet the merchant doesn\u2019t yet have a point-of-sale integration. But all of those things are just ways of delivering value to our merchant partners. That\u2019s what we do all day every day.\nChris Brendler: Great. That\u2019s great color. And I actually have a related question, speaking of delivering value to your merchant partners. It seems like the biggest bear case or pushback I get on this story is merchant pricing and the entrance of PayPal and other potential providers who are going to give it away \"for free\" or credit card interchange rates that could potentially undermine the pricing model that a lot of the buy now, pay later start-ups or, I guess, pioneers have used. My impression is that Affirm is a little bit different, given your product mix and your ability to do loan products. So, maybe just comment on merchant pricing and your ability to drive contract renewals that have pricing at relatively similar levels, given the value into merchants. Thanks.\nMax Levchin: There\u2019s a lot in there. I\u2019ll try to keep it short, although this may well turn into a [indiscernible]. So, one maybe way of thinking about merchant\u2019s perception or merchant\u2019s relationship with Affirm, we are not just a payment provider. We are fundamentally a marketing device for merchants. And so, when you typically talk about price compression, as you know -- why are you outside the interchange boxes of a common payment industry? It doesn\u2019t really apply to us. We are competing for both, the payments budget but more importantly for the marketing budget. When the merchant says, do I discount or do I do something else? Affirm stands up and says, don\u2019t discount. Instead, offer 0% rate and maintain your price integrity. That is not something merchants can do without our help, but that\u2019s what we do at Peloton. That\u2019s what we do at almost half of our transaction volume. The 0% transactions are really powerful converters of consumers that are on offense. They\u2019re trying to figure out whether they want to transact or they want to transact right now. So, it\u2019s really, really important. And fundamentally, that doesn\u2019t really go against the payments budget, and it doesn\u2019t compete with payments so much as it becomes a marketing channel or a marketing accelerator. There\u2019s a lot more where that came from, if you just think for a second about what the app does. So, it doesn\u2019t even help consumers convert, it helps them become excited about a product they can find out about it as they are spending time in our ecosystem. Maybe servicing their loan, maybe they\u2019re checking out what merchants we brought on. But that\u2019s another opportunity to tell our consumers that, hey, this is new promotion, this is new interesting idea, all while helping the merchant maintain price integrity. And so, I think those kind of points really highlight that we\u2019re fundamentally not in the same space as credit card players or -- we\u2019re not comparing our pricing to them. I\u2019ll actually pause there. I feel like I\u2019ve meandered into details. Michael, keep you honest with\u2026\nChris Brendler: I don\u2019t want to get into detail on this call. Maybe Max -- that\u2019s awesome. Maybe just fair to say that merchant pricing is not one of your biggest concerns near term?\nMax Levchin: It\u2019s not, and probably where it\u2019s most apparent is in the high-ticket items. I think, you can really see that -- navigating that becomes a lot more about managing risk and managing the technical integration and just the overall interaction with the consumer also creates -- if you think about buying a Peloton, that\u2019s 39 opportunities for me to tell you about all the cool exciting things that are happening in the Affirm space. And that\u2019s really, really powerful. It\u2019s very different from your relationship with PayPal, frankly, or with your credit card provider.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Really solid quarter. I also was going to ask about that. Maybe Michael, just your perspective on a same-store sales kind of merchant take rate because I know that does come up a lot, maybe on renewals, what you\u2019re seeing, and is there a big difference between high AOV and low AOV?\nMichael Linford: There\u2019s not a difference in terms of the trend around renewals. I think, frankly, we\u2019re probably still in the early innings on that. And that will bear itself out over the next couple of years before you start to see meaningful pressure on things like contract renewals. So, not really a data point there. What I would say though, is that we -- it\u2019s unquestionably very competitive out there in the low AOV space. If you\u2019re only offering payment for, it is increasingly becoming commoditized. And that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s so important to offer a wider range of average order value solutions and increase the merchant services that we offer beyond just buy now, pay later, and hence the acquisition for Returnly.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And just a follow-up on the Shopify deal. How will you guys end up converting more of the existing merchant base, the 12,500 you\u2019re at now? Is there something you\u2019re doing to get those guys ramped up quicker? And then, how also do you get more checkout? Do you push -- is there a way to push the solution more to get them to push the Affirm solution? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: I think the short answer is, we expect to get a lot more. I think, this deal really only makes sense if this is a pervasive, I guess, is the word I\u2019m looking for, a solution across the Shopify ecosystem. And I think both companies are very motivated to make sure that now that we\u2019re finally ready for a GA rollout that it comes to a lot more than 12,500 merchants. 12,500 merchants went live primarily in just the last 30 days or so. And so, this is a good test of what demand looks like. The multiple education opportunities that we have with -- in concert with Shopify. For larger players, we go to market together. We have our sales teams working side-by-side, making sure that we educate enterprises, making sure that we figure out exactly what solutions they customize for them. A big part of why Shopify chose us is we\u2019re not a one-trick pony. We\u2019re not just paying for and what else do you need. We\u2019ve built very, very complex, very interesting systems for our partners from Priceline to Walmart. And some of the larger players that are on Shopify really have some pretty strict requirements and there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to go there. And in the long tail, Shopify is fairly exceptional at communicating with the merchants. And we are very excited to finally be ready to tell the story to the hundreds of thousands of shops that are eligible for this solution.\nOperator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session, as well as today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call. We\u2019re excited to update you on the performance of our business and the progress we achieved since our call in February. But before we go through the numbers, I would like to start by sharing a few stories from the past quarter to help demonstrate the power of Affirm. As many of you know, at Affirm, one of our core values is that people come first. That means that we constantly consider our impact on people\u2019s lives, and we strive to put their interest before our own. That\u2019s why we never charge late or hidden fees. It\u2019s also why we\u2019re always looking at what consumers have to say about us and how we\u2019re helping them get the things they want and need. In March, we celebrated Affirm\u2019s ninth birthday with a giveaway on Instagram. To participate, we asked consumers to share their favorite experience or purchase using Affirm. I was inspired by many of the more than 11,000 personal stories that were posted. One nurse thanked us for the affordable monthly payments that allowed her to buy a Theragun Prime massager, which helped soothe her aches and pains after a 12-hour shift during the pandemic. A mother of two thanked us for helping her take her family to Disney World just before her new baby arrived. She appreciated that she could book a special vacation without breaking the bank. I also frequently speak with merchants. Understanding their needs and how we help them achieve their goals is critical to establishing long-term partnerships. Recently, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with travel merchants in particular as they focus on meeting consumers\u2019 pent-up demand coming out of the pandemic. Thanks to Affirm, companies like Priceline, which we started partnering with in 2018, have added new customers. Priceline shared with us that their consumers are booking with greater confidence because of Affirm\u2019s flexible and gaucher-free payment solutions. They also shared that Affirm helps them expand their reach among millennial and Gen Z consumers. At the heart of the value we deliver to consumers and merchants is Affirm\u2019s unrivaled technology. The speed and accuracy of our technology allows us to instantly elevate consumers\u2019 requests and provide them with tailored payment options within seconds. And the quality and scalability of our technology has led large-scale platforms like Shopify to choose us as their partner. Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that more than 10,000 merchants have gone live with Shop Pay installments in just April and early May, and we expect this number to grow significantly when we move to general availability for new and existing merchants, which we expect to reach between now and the end of June. I will come back to the importance of our technology in a moment, but let me share an overview of our results for the third fiscal quarter. Affirm delivered another strong quarter that exceeded the financial outlook we provided in February. We more than doubled our active merchant count year-over-year to nearly 12,000. We accelerated year-over-year GMV growth to 83% from 55% in the second quarter. And excluding Peloton, our GMV grew 100%, up from 54% in the previous quarter. We also grew active consumers by 60% over the last 12 months. GMV growth was strong across all categories in the third quarter. This was driven primarily by consumer demand for Affirm\u2019s offerings as well as new and expanded relationships with merchants such as Ikon Pass, Neiman Marcus and Vrbo, among others. Categories that have fared well throughout the pandemic such as sporting goods, furniture and homewares continued to perform. Nearing the end of the quarter, we also began to see a sharp uptick in spending in categories that have been pressured by the pandemic. Travel and ticketing was particularly strong. GMV for the category nearly tripled for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and grew by more than 50% versus Q3 of last year, which was our pre-COVID quarterly high mark in travel. We are encouraged by this momentum and believe that the strengthening economy will provide another tailwind for Affirm. Americans have significant spending power coming out of the pandemic after paying down a record $83 billion in credit card debt and amassing $1.7 trillion in savings in 2020. The pandemic has also trained more shoppers to buy online, growing the U.S. e-commerce markets to nearly $800 billion. We expect this improved financial health, coupled with rising positive sentiment among consumers and the ongoing reopening, to support our continued growth. We look forward to being there for the consumers as they buy and use suit before returning to work, a wedding dress for the reception they put off or an airline ticket to see their missed loved ones. Our team also made excellent progress on our strategic objectives over the last few months. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are continuing to expand our presence into higher-frequency categories by activating our partnership with Shopify. Over the last several weeks, we have accelerated merchant onboarding, enabling Shop Pay installments by Affirm for more than 10,000 shop merchants, up from 100 merchants in our pilot that we shared with you back in February. We believe that scaling our partnership with Shopify will position us to grow our business with a large and diverse set of merchants. Shopify\u2019s team told us that Shop Pay Installments by Affirm has enabled them to offer a solution that will scale with their rapid growth and reduced buy now, pay later checkout times by as much as 30% for both new and returning users. We also expanded our platform by acquiring Returnly, a technology company that makes returns and exchanges seamless for both consumers and merchants. Today, Returnly helps more than 1,800 merchants increase return to repurchase rates, drive revenue from returns and elevate consumer satisfaction. We look forward to delivering returns with offerings to more merchants and introducing their more than 8 million users to Affirm. Before I turn the call over to Michael, let me briefly come back to my earlier point on our technology advantage. Affirm is a technology company, and we believe our technology is unparalleled among our competitors. We thrive on solving complex problems for both consumers and merchants that others can\u2019t or won\u2019t. The resulting technical expertise serves as an important competitive advantage. Leveraging our proprietary machine learning, we\u2019re able to personalize offers for consumers, more efficiently proven price credit and manage risk in ways that achieve better credit outcomes. As a result, we\u2019re able to offer more flexibility for consumers, allowing them to use Affirm across a range of price points and loan durations. These advantages differentiate us from buy now, pay later providers and other networks by allowing us to offer consumers much more than a short duration paid in for solution, which is critical in categories such as travel that have high transaction values. Our technology also enables us to drive measurable growth for our merchants. They see this in the volume of purchases we generate for them, increased conversion rates, higher average order values and incremental consumers. In fact, in the third quarter, approximately one-third of transactions were driven from Affirm\u2019s app and site. Our ability to consistently deliver strong results for our merchants is why so many large enterprises, including Walmart and Priceline, choose to partner with Affirm. Of course, great technology is ultimately about great technologists. In order to sustain and extend our advantage in technology, we\u2019re investing in the people behind it and elevating its leadership within the Company. As a part of that, we announced today that Libor Michalek, Affirm\u2019s President of Technology, has been appointed to our Board of Directors. Libor is one of the most highly-regarded technology minds in the fintech industry and has played a critical role in developing a proprietary technology platform that is a key competitive advantage for our business. Building world-class technology is critical to our strategy, and we\u2019re pleased to have Libor bring his significant software, systems, security, machine learning and engineering experience to our boardroom. Libor\u2019s appointment reflects our dedication to leveraging technology and innovation as competitive advantages that allow us to better deliver exceptional solutions for consumers and merchants at scale. Before I conclude, let me briefly turn to some additional leadership updates. Today, we announced that our Chief Legal Officer, Sharda Caro Del Castillo, has decided to step down from her role at Affirm. Sharda led our legal team during a critical time for our Company as we conducted our IPO, navigated an unprecedented market period and achieved tremendous growth. I want to thank her for her dedication and leadership. She\u2019s been a trusted and valued counselor to me and our whole leadership team, and we wish her all the best. Katherine Adkins will be assuming the role of Chief Legal Officer. Katherine has been one of Sharda\u2019s deputies, an integral part of our senior legal team and taken on increased responsibility while supporting the important legal needs of the Company. She will play a critical role as we continue to expand the ubiquity of our platform, strengthening, scaling and growing Affirm for the long term, and we\u2019re grateful to have her as a part of our leadership team. In summary, we had a strong third quarter and we made excellent progress on our strategic goals. We\u2019re seeing strengthening momentum in our business as consumers and merchant adoption continues to grow, and we believe Affirm is uniquely positioned to capture the large and growing opportunity in front of us. None of this will be possible without the hard work of Affirmers. They have delivered excellent results through the pandemic, provided exceptional service to our consumers and merchants, welcomed PayBright and Returnly teams to the Affirm family and prepared us for success as a public Company. I couldn\u2019t be more proud and appreciative of Affirmers\u2019 focus and dedication on behalf of our consumers, our merchants and our shareholders. Together, we have accomplished a lot, but we\u2019re really just getting started. And with that, I will turn it over to Michael to take you through the details of the third quarter and share our outlook for the fourth quarter. Yes. So, first of all, you\u2019re totally right. Traveling and ticketing is seeing what could only be described as a resurgence. So, if you look at the comparison to last year, fiscal Q3, which was a high pre-COVID quarterly market, it\u2019s really important to note that in general, we are comparing in this quarter to kind of a pre-COVID Affirm because obviously COVID changed everything. But the growth even versus that number was 50% that we\u2019re coming off from a essentially collapsed base. Now, if you sort of zoom in and look at what\u2019s happening right now, the month-to-month growth is nearly tripled. And so, it\u2019s just an unbelievable resurgence, very, very quickly in that space. And we\u2019re very excited about it is. We\u2019re very well-positioned. We have all kinds of exciting partners in the places like Ikon Pass, Vrbo, accounts like Expedia, Priceline, some of these folks have been with us for a very long time, like other new partner and then, of course, Delta Vacations, American Airlines, our enormous partner as well. And so, we\u2019re very well positioned in the space. It actually speaks a little bit to the fact that we\u2019re quite unique among our BNPL brethren in a sense that we play in both low and high-ticket items, and obviously sort of pent-up demand for just getting out of town and going somewhere nice implies higher ticket values and we have to provide our services for both multi-hundred dollar and multi-thousand dollar tickets there. So, we do very well with all of those. So, I think, I\u2019ll let Michael opine on exactly what we might want to guide to. But the overall economic recovery is just huge in the travel ticketing space, and we are super well positioned to benefit. We\u2019re starting to see all the investments that we made over the last year just setting up for this recovery really pay off. I\u2019ll let Michael speak to the modeling part of this, since that\u2019s certainly his headache. But in terms of the value to us, it\u2019s an amazing synergy. If you think of it sort of from the product point of view, Returnly literally picks up where Affirm leaves off. So, if you look at -- we bring the consumer to the checkout counter with the confidence and certainty that they will be able to afford this, there\u2019ll be no fees. There\u2019ll be total transparency in pricing, often go and they\u2019re happy to buy. And what will happen if the shoe doesn\u2019t fit or if they don\u2019t quite like the color, they need it exchanged. And up until the Returnly acquisition, Affirm said, well, great, we\u2019ll be a really nice clean refund process for you. But once the merchant restocks and refunds, then you can come back and shop. And we always saw that as just a huge opportunity for us to step in and say, well, what if we know a customer well enough to allow them to shop even before they put the unwanted item in a box, so that they can accelerate commerce for them to get their satisfaction that much faster and help merchants just move the inventory that much quicker? And so, we saw this long enough ago as we actually invested in Returnly. So, this is not an old friend. We would track it and see progress for a very long time. We\u2019re proud investors and something to realize that the synergies were too great to let them be too far away from us and completed the acquisition. And you will see just an incredible amount of synergies. First and foremost, from the point of view of going to markets, when we speak to merchants, we\u2019ve heard the question, what do you do about returns? Often of our standard answer has always been, well, we\u2019ll be your best return handling partner because consumers love us. We don\u2019t charge fees. There\u2019ll be no hidden gadget. Now, of course, we can augment by saying, \"actually, we\u2019ll make it even better, before they even have to put the unwanted item in a box, we will be there, they can start shopping right away and help you sell more. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about this and it\u2019s just close so we have a ton to bring to market together. We have a massive network of users. 8 million people have used Returnly successfully, and that\u2019s another shift for our products on the Affirm side, and there\u2019s much more work to do together. I don\u2019t know, Michael, if you want to comment on how to account for the revenue opportunities. Yes. That\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019m afraid I have to update the Shopify number for you. Just since the last we added the press release, the number went up to 12,500. So, we got -- this is not a forward-looking statement. I don\u2019t know how quickly it will grow, but obviously, it\u2019s growing pretty quickly. So just to give you a quick breakdown of what\u2019s happening at Shopify. So, first of all, we\u2019re obviously super excited that we\u2019re finally here. GA for this product will be available sometime in June. And that means that every new Shopify merchant coming on to the platform will have Shop Pay Installments powered by Affirm enabled automatically. And so, we\u2019ll just see, we think, a tremendous amount of uptake on the merchant side. Now, because Shopify is not exactly a small network, in fact, there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of merchants that are eligible for Affirm\u2019s products or collaborative product together, we have been pre-approving and inviting existing merchants onto the platform, and that\u2019s where these sort of scaling numbers are coming from. We\u2019re far from done there. And so, we expect this number to continue growing not linearly. And I have very little prediction as to how fast it will go, but there\u2019s a lot more to add to this 12,500. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening on the Shopify side of things. Very excited about where that\u2019s headed. Lots and lots more to do together as well, so we worked very long and hard. One cool stat about Shopify, I just wanted to make sure that we\u2019re honest when we offer this product to the merchants by way of being, in fact, better as opposed to just an exclusive partner. And so, we had timed the time to complete a transaction using Shop Pay Installments powered by Affirm versus all the other competing products that you may encountered in a while. In both new and existing customers, we\u2019re at least 30% faster in converting. So, not do we only have a prime placement of this product, we also are, in fact, offering the very best product in the market. And so, I think that\u2019s a fairly powerful endorsement on the platform. Card, so, some of you have met us during our testing the waters process before we went out to actually do a initial public offering. It\u2019s roughly what I wanted to do with the card announcement. It\u2019s very different. And I agree that\u2019s very exciting, but it\u2019s easy to get excited about what\u2019s going on in your own head without getting confirmation from consumers. So, we announced the product primarily to see what would happen to our wait list? Would we find ourselves surrounded by yawns or people actually saying, wow, that\u2019s the most exciting thing that\u2019s hit the news cycle in the world that already pretty exciting fintech. Very happy to report that the wait list is of excellent length from my vantage point, and we\u2019re very excited to bring this product to market. But it\u2019s all in good time. We\u2019re going to let out this year.\nMatt O\u2019Neill: Okay, got it. Thanks. And maybe just one real quick follow-up. Would you be willing to help us at all think through the composition of next quarter\u2019s guidance, specifically with respect to the provision just because that\u2019s been a line of outperformance in the two quarters as a public company? Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll jump back in. So, I guess, the easiest thing to serve -- to make it extremely black and white is that you will be able to service your Shop Pay Installments loan either inside the Shop app or its idea for an app. So, I think that should give you sort of quite a lot of the answer. There\u2019s a lot of user interface details that have to be read. And so, if we see the customer again together with Shopify within the broader Shopify ecosystem, which is quite a big at this point, of course, it\u2019s very easy to recognize them within the Shop Pay environment. We have a prime placement there and that will be the smoothest experience possible. If and when we find this customer outside of a Shopify ecosystem, we want to make sure we don\u2019t sort of say, freak them out by saying, hey, we\u2019ve met you before. So, how do you go, you\u2019re signed up. But that kind of experience as well will be extremely smooth and they\u2019ll be able to reaffirm their identity, if you will, and could become -- be able to use our services on any other merchant. So, there\u2019s a slight difference between all those paths, but they\u2019re all designed to be extremely simple. The most important thing that\u2019s really worth understanding is that the underwriting cost, the data associated with the customer provisions, all the things that we have to do to make sure that this customer is, in fact, someone we are willing to take the risk with happens in that first transaction. And so, there\u2019s just an enormous synergies financially as well as from user interface point of view as we bring these customers on board. I think, depending on the circumstances, I think there\u2019s probably a little bit more nuance to the answer than yes, but if you have doubt, we have no intention of spamming Shopify customers, if that\u2019s the underlying question. That\u2019s not happening. So, I think there\u2019s a lot of different strands going on. So, in general, we see the economic recovery as a huge tailwind for us, and there\u2019s a bunch of different things that are connected to it. And some of it is in travel and ticketing category, which just sort of coiled up and is now rapidly spitting up as people are able to travel finally to see their loved ones. There\u2019s also all kinds of subcategories that may not naturally go to immediately but they are quite large and are happening. For example, 97% of old weddings got postponed and only 5% of that got canceled. So, there\u2019s a lot of people that need to buy relatively expensive bridal dresses and also some other things. And again, playing in the high-ticket items as well as low-ticket items really positions us well for these sorts of affordable luxuries as well as everyday expenses. And so, we see a lot of demand in all these categories that just kind of took a break during 2020, if you will. That said, we are not seeing a reduction in demand in fashion and in home, fitness, outdoor. All the different categories where Affirm has traditionally been very, very strong are in fact continuing strong. If you actually, again, look at the sort of the pre-pandemic comparison we have in this quarter, ex-Peloton, we grew 100%, which is a pretty massive acceleration from the quarter prior. So, we effectively, not quite, but almost doubled the second derivative of growth here. And that is already as the recovery began, still from a small base, but the demand for this product is what\u2019s driving our growth. It\u2019s less the sort of trade-off from category to category. So, we\u2019re very excited about all of these things and obviously have to. I believe it will be there in all those places as the demand spins up. I was actually -- I was trying to figure out what you meant by card-present. So now, I get it. So, slight step back, but it could be important for us to provide what sometimes known as the omnichannel solutions especially for our largest partners. We have a very large long-term partnership with Walmart that\u2019s been very successful. A lot of our larger enterprise customers are now setting up for completely new modalities of interacting with their consumers, buy in store, return online, buy online, return in store. So, all these different new modes of transacting is a thing, and it\u2019s really important that we are able to meet the consumers where we are. In part, our card strategy we think is kind of one of the best reengagement techniques we have to offer to our consumer. If Affirm is something that you love and our net promoter score speaks for itself, if we are in your wallet, be it on a screen or in your actual physical wallet, we\u2019ll have a chance to remind you that you can use Affirm pretty much everywhere you go. And so, we think of our card strategy and overall omnichannel strategy in store and out of store as a sort of continuous landscape of just being where the customer is and making sure, in this case, the end consumer is making sure that we\u2019re able to meet their demands. In fact, 0% outside of Peloton accelerated. I\u2019ll let Michael speak to the guidance but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re giving it. But, I think it\u2019s a little bit early to speak to the deck numbers, just given the fact that literally, the 10,000 number -- 12,500 number that we quoted, all of this happened in less -- the last 30 days, just to make sure I\u2019m not perjuring myself there. And so, there is -- it\u2019s a very, very rapidly increasing merchant base. We\u2019ll be able to speak a little bit more clearly as to what this actually means in terms of volume and in terms of consumer adoption. Obviously, we spent nearly a year testing the product, making sure it\u2019s much faster than competition, much better converting -- competitive in and of itself and better positioned than the competition. But we\u2019ll -- we have very high hopes for what that actually means in terms of volume generation, but we\u2019ll speak to real numbers as we have them. Definitely hard to speak to industry consolidation since that doesn\u2019t include us. We think we\u2019re the best. But obviously, everybody has a bias for their own. That said, I think last quarter, I said something on the lines of we expect low AOV to have ultimately capacity to offer multiple providers integrated, while higher AOV probably trends to one provider. I think that\u2019s still true. I would say that the momentum towards multiple providers at a single low AOV merchant has not been quite as quick as I\u2019d anticipated, while the ability to retain an ability to serve high AOV merchants has been even stronger than I thought. I think the complexity of both technical and risk management on the higher AOV sort things, that\u2019s what we consider to be our core vantage. That\u2019s very real and it\u2019s very hard for our competitors to speak credibly in that area at all. On the low AOV side of things, I think the -- again, I believe that ultimately, brands will have one or two, maybe three providers. It\u2019s a little bit early. There\u2019s so much growth available in every sub-segment. In low AUV, it\u2019s fundamentally fashion, beauty, some of this are lower -- hard goods, low-cost hard goods. And at the moment, there\u2019s so much demand just looking at the numbers that I just quoted on Shopify. It\u2019s pretty clear that there\u2019s an enormous amount of pent-up demand on the merchant side. And so, at the moment, the competitive overlap is not yet a major topic on our minds. But we\u2019ll report back in a quarter. I agree. That is why we have a sales team. They are very hard at work. It\u2019s their problem. So I\u2019ll give you a more serious answer. So, in our app, and it -- actually even -- there\u2019s multiple ways we collaborate with merchants. One of them, obviously, is the -- embedded at the point of sale, sort of classic buy now, pay later or pay in 6 day and 12, whatever the merchant\u2019s suite that we offer at checkout that makes sense for this particular price point. Beyond that, there\u2019s our approximately, and in our app, you can be listed whether you\u2019re integrated or not. The way we get competition from merchants for driving these new incremental transactions, which are very, very powerful, by the way, for them, their impact more valuable than consumers that we help close at the point of sale. These customers actually are starting their shopping journey in our app and are going to a point of sale at a merchant. In those situations, merchants quite frequently will pay us essentially a bounty or a referral bonus for bringing this consumer to them. And then, within the app itself, we have quite a lot -- and by the way, when I say the app, I use it interchangeably with our sites. A fair amount of our consumers use our sites just perhaps because they prefer the larger screen format. But in both those cases, those are potentially advertising opportunities for our merchant partners to bring their offers, new products, et cetera, to the Affirm ecosystem. And so, in all those situations, there is a financial relationship with the merchant. Sometimes, the merchant doesn\u2019t have Affirm integrated at the point of sale yet. They may have already signing agreement, and we are waiting for the technical teams to become available. Part of what we pride ourselves on is this ability to be live here very quickly. We have a variety of integration modalities. We have this thing that we\u2019ve really been leading into, called, Affirm Lite, [ph] which allows merchants to go live literally within minutes of signing a contract. But there\u2019s many different modalities of integration. Sometimes, it\u2019s going high, that\u2019s when sometimes you\u2019ll find us promoting a merchant in our app and yet the merchant doesn\u2019t yet have a point-of-sale integration. But all of those things are just ways of delivering value to our merchant partners. That\u2019s what we do all day every day. There\u2019s a lot in there. I\u2019ll try to keep it short, although this may well turn into a [indiscernible]. So, one maybe way of thinking about merchant\u2019s perception or merchant\u2019s relationship with Affirm, we are not just a payment provider. We are fundamentally a marketing device for merchants. And so, when you typically talk about price compression, as you know -- why are you outside the interchange boxes of a common payment industry? It doesn\u2019t really apply to us. We are competing for both, the payments budget but more importantly for the marketing budget. When the merchant says, do I discount or do I do something else? Affirm stands up and says, don\u2019t discount. Instead, offer 0% rate and maintain your price integrity. That is not something merchants can do without our help, but that\u2019s what we do at Peloton. That\u2019s what we do at almost half of our transaction volume. The 0% transactions are really powerful converters of consumers that are on offense. They\u2019re trying to figure out whether they want to transact or they want to transact right now. So, it\u2019s really, really important. And fundamentally, that doesn\u2019t really go against the payments budget, and it doesn\u2019t compete with payments so much as it becomes a marketing channel or a marketing accelerator. There\u2019s a lot more where that came from, if you just think for a second about what the app does. So, it doesn\u2019t even help consumers convert, it helps them become excited about a product they can find out about it as they are spending time in our ecosystem. Maybe servicing their loan, maybe they\u2019re checking out what merchants we brought on. But that\u2019s another opportunity to tell our consumers that, hey, this is new promotion, this is new interesting idea, all while helping the merchant maintain price integrity. And so, I think those kind of points really highlight that we\u2019re fundamentally not in the same space as credit card players or -- we\u2019re not comparing our pricing to them. I\u2019ll actually pause there. I feel like I\u2019ve meandered into details. Michael, keep you honest with\u2026 It\u2019s not, and probably where it\u2019s most apparent is in the high-ticket items. I think, you can really see that -- navigating that becomes a lot more about managing risk and managing the technical integration and just the overall interaction with the consumer also creates -- if you think about buying a Peloton, that\u2019s 39 opportunities for me to tell you about all the cool exciting things that are happening in the Affirm space. And that\u2019s really, really powerful. It\u2019s very different from your relationship with PayPal, frankly, or with your credit card provider. I think the short answer is, we expect to get a lot more. I think, this deal really only makes sense if this is a pervasive, I guess, is the word I\u2019m looking for, a solution across the Shopify ecosystem. And I think both companies are very motivated to make sure that now that we\u2019re finally ready for a GA rollout that it comes to a lot more than 12,500 merchants. 12,500 merchants went live primarily in just the last 30 days or so. And so, this is a good test of what demand looks like. The multiple education opportunities that we have with -- in concert with Shopify. For larger players, we go to market together. We have our sales teams working side-by-side, making sure that we educate enterprises, making sure that we figure out exactly what solutions they customize for them. A big part of why Shopify chose us is we\u2019re not a one-trick pony. We\u2019re not just paying for and what else do you need. We\u2019ve built very, very complex, very interesting systems for our partners from Priceline to Walmart. And some of the larger players that are on Shopify really have some pretty strict requirements and there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to go there. And in the long tail, Shopify is fairly exceptional at communicating with the merchants. And we are very excited to finally be ready to tell the story to the hundreds of thousands of shops that are eligible for this solution."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Thanks, Max, and good afternoon, everyone. As Max noted, we had a strong third quarter. GMV and revenue exceeded our financial outlook, growing 83% and 67%, respectively, and accelerating from the year-over-year growth rates we achieved in the second quarter of 2021. We delivered on this growth with significantly greater capital efficiency, reducing equity capital required by 10% compared to the prior year period, despite growing the balance sheet by more than 100%. We also delivered stronger credit performance with our allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment declining to a record low of 5.2%. These trends are encouraging, and we remain focused on building on this momentum as we move forward. I\u2019ll now walk you through some of the key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook, which we are raising today to reflect the strong performance of the business. Unless otherwise stated, all period-to-period comparative data refers to our third fiscal quarter of 2021 compared to our third fiscal quarter of 2020. Third quarter GMV grew 83% to $2.3 billion, exceeding our outlook for $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion. The increase was driven by strong merchant and consumer adoption across all categories. As of the end of the third quarter, active merchants more than doubled to nearly 12,000 while active consumers, which we measure over the prior 12-month period, increased 60% to 5.4 million. Transactions per active consumer also rose from 2.1 to 2.3. While GMV exceeded our outlook, the momentum of the business was even stronger than the 83% headline growth indicates. Excluding Peloton, the third quarter GMV doubled, driven by growth across all categories that Affirm serves as well as from both new and existing merchant relationships. The broad-based category growth also served to diversify merchant concentration as Peloton, where fulfillment lead times improved, outpacing our expectations, represented 18% of third quarter GMV compared to 25% a year ago. As Max indicated, travel was the real highlight among our verticals, even though its takeoff began late in the quarter. Travel accounted for just 2% of September quarter GMV but has steadily grown to 9% in the March ending quarter. In April, travel growth continued to accelerate, taking its proportion of GMV to 11% of the Company-wide total. Given the investments in partnerships we\u2019ve made in the category, we expect travel to contribute meaningfully in the fourth quarter and beyond. Our 0 APR business accounted for 43% of our total GMV, consistent with the third quarter 2020. Loans with a term length of greater than 12 months accounted for 30%, down from 35% in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting our expanded merchant base and higher velocity and lower average order value categories. Accordingly, AOV also declined slightly from $612 to $564. The strong momentum in GMV growth in the third quarter translated into revenue growth that also exceeded the expectations we shared with you in February of $185 million to $195 million. Third quarter net revenue of $231 million increased 67%, driven by total network revenue, which grew 53% to $112 million and interest income which grew 80% to $95 million. Roughly one-third of interest income was driven by the amortization of the discounts on loans held for investment on the balance sheet rather than from consumer interest payments. The portion of interest income related to consumer interest payments grew more slowly, up 42% year-to-year. Revenue from gain on sale loans of $16 million increased from $10 million in the year-ago quarter as a result of more favorable loan sale pricing terms and more volumes sold. Finally, servicing income of $8 million increased from $3 million in the prior year as the average unpaid principal balance of loans owned by third parties grew year-over-year. I\u2019d like to call out that our Q3 results include a $3.5 million reduction to total revenue, which we recorded in relation to the estimated financial impact to Affirm of Peloton\u2019s announced voluntary recall of their Tread and Tread+ products. This reduction is split between $3.1 million in merchant network revenue and $0.4 million in interest income. The estimate was based on projected return rates provided by Peloton for the quarter ending June 30, 2021, in its most recent quarterly filing. We continued to improve our unit economics in Q3, growing revenue 67% of all transaction costs, excluding the provision for credit losses, grew 50%. Transaction costs, including the provision for credit losses in the third quarter, were $97 million, a 34% year-over-year decrease. Third quarter results included an $83 million decrease in the provision for credit losses versus 2020. Transaction costs, excluding the provision for credit losses, were $98 million, up $33 million or 50% from the third quarter 2020, significantly slower than revenue growth. Loss on loan purchase commitment was $62 million compared to $44 million in the prior year, driven by the increased volume of 0% APR loans. Provisions for credit losses was a gain of $1 million compared to an expense of $82 million in the prior year, reflecting the reduction in allowance to a record low of 5.2% of loans held for investment. Last year, we took an incremental $56 million provision in anticipation of record unemployment, which has been released over time as we have been experiencing stronger-than-expected repayment history in the portfolio. The reduced allowance that I mentioned reflects materially better estimates on future loan losses and is consistent with our strong credit performance. Additionally, due to our loss of emerging growth company status, we also adopted the CECL accounting standard retroactive to July 1, 2020, which did not have a material impact on provision for credit losses in this period. Funding costs increased from $8 million to $15 million in the third quarter of 2021 but grew slower than loans held for investment. The increase reflects the issuance of securitization trusts, which bear interest at a fixed rate as well as increased average funding debt offset by the lower average interest rates. Finally, processing and servicing were $21 million, up from $14 million in the year-ago quarter but grew slower than total platform portfolio as we realized scale efficiencies. The combination of strong top line performance and reduced transaction costs resulted in better-than-expected revenue less transaction cost of $134 million compared to our third quarter outlook for $60 million to $65 million. Looking beyond transaction costs to our investments to drive long-term growth, there was a meaningful impact this quarter from stock-based compensation primarily related to the January IPO. Technology and data analytics expense grew 193% to $99 million or from 24% to 43% of net revenue, primarily reflecting SBC and higher engineering headcount as we worked to extend our competitive advantage and technology that Max noted previously. Excluding SBC of $46 million, technology and data analytics expense grew 74% compared to the year-ago quarter. Sales and marketing expense increased from $7 million to $58 million or from 5% to 25% of net revenue, primarily as a result of SBC and the vesting of awards granted to Shopify associated with our exclusive long-term partnership. Excluding SBC of $10 million and the impact of Shopify warrants of $17 million, sales and marketing expense grew by $25 million compared to the year-ago quarter. General and administrative expense increased from $31 million last year to $147 million or from 23% to 64% of net revenue, due in part to an increase in the finance, legal, operations and administrative headcount to support the Company\u2019s long-term growth and public company operations. G&A also included an $11 million sublet impairment relating to our changing real estate footprint in light of our remote first policy. Excluding SBC of $82 million, which includes $38 million associated with the grant of multiyear performance-based stock options to our Chief Executive Officer, G&A expenses grew 132% compared to the year-ago quarter. Including these expenses, GAAP operating loss was $169 million in the third quarter of \u201821 compared to an $82 million in the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted operating income, which excludes depreciation and amortization of $5 million, stock-based compensation of $140 million, the Shopify warrants of $17 million and other nonrecurring items of $13 million, was $5 million, a $76 million improvement from the adjusted operating loss of $71 million in the year-ago period. As a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating margin increased 53 points from the third quarter of 2020 and was 2%. We continue to deliver on our strategy to grow our business while being very efficient with our equity capital. On the growth side, total platform portfolio, which includes the unpaid balance of all loans facilitated through our platform, including those loans held by third parties, grew from $2.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, to $4.2 billion at the end of the third quarter or $1.8 billion of year-to-year growth. This $1.8 billion in growth was funded by $1.3 billion in securitization volume and $552 million in forward flow volume while we were relatively flat year-on-year with the on-balance sheet we\u2019re having. On the funding side, in our third quarter, we executed a 2021-A revolving securitization in addition to a new warehouse facility and new loan sale program. These deals allowed us to efficiently scale our program. Despite growing our loans in the balance sheet by $1.2 billion, we were able to reduce the equity capital required from the year-ago quarter by 10% from $229 million to $207 million. As a percentage of total platform portfolio, equity capital required fell to 5% from approximately 10% in the year ago quarter. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the momentum in our business, and we believe the strengthening of the overall economy will serve as a tailwind in the fourth quarter. We are seeing GMV growth across all categories, particularly those hardest hit by the pandemic as demand recovers. We are also encouraged by the strong consumer and merchant adoption we saw in the third quarter. Reflecting these dynamics, we are raising our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. For our fourth quarter ending June 30, 2021, we expect GMV of $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; revenue of $215 million to $225 million; transaction cost of $135 million to $140 million; revenue less transaction cost of $80 million to $85 million; and adjusted operating loss of $55 million to $50 million; and a weighted average share count to 270 million. As I noted a moment ago, we recorded a $3.5 million reduction to revenue in Q3, which represents the estimated direct revenue impact from Peloton\u2019s Tread and Tread+ recall. While we do not expect any additional revenue impact from the refunded merchant fees in Q4, we do expect an increase in returns starting in the near term, which will negatively impact key operating metrics like GMV. Our financial outlook takes into account this estimated GMV impact associated with the refunds as well as an estimated impact on lower future Tread and Tread+ GMV. Additionally, our outlook includes the impact from the acquisition of Returnly, which we closed on May 1st but do not expect to be material in Q4. For our fiscal year 2021 ending June 30, 2021, we now expect GMV of $8.01 billion to $8.06 billion, revenue of $824 million to $834 million; transaction cost of $460 million to $465 million; revenue less transaction cost of $364 million to $369 million; adjusted operating loss of $55 million to $50 million; and a weighted average share count of approximately 160 million. The full year guidance and the fiscal year-to-date financials include the impact of the adoption of CECL retroactive to July 1, 2020. This adoption resulted in a $16 million downward revision to the previously reported provision for credit losses for the first half of fiscal \u201821 as a result of the reduction in allowance. In closing, we had a strong third quarter. Consumers are adopting our product in greater numbers and our merchant partners are seeing real growth enabled by our product offering, and we believe the best is yet to come. We are delivering on our mission to improve lives with honest financial products while also delivering results for our shareholders. With that, we\u2019re happy to answer your questions. Yes. So, when looking at merchant fee revenue, the first thing is really important to sum up both the merchant network revenue and the virtual card network revenue lines. In particular, the virtual card network revenue is a key way we collect merchant fees from our travel merchants. So, as travel continues to gain in importance, it\u2019s an important line to look at in combination. And then, yes, the biggest impact\u2019s around just the total take rate, which was actually in line with our expectations, is the mix away from longer-term 0% loans, notably Peloton, which declined in concentration. Yes. We\u2019re not going to give any guidance into 2022 right now. But the only other thing I\u2019d add is, there\u2019s a small impact from, obviously, a $3.5 million number you see in Peloton this quarter and then the interest income dynamic, which definitely affects the merchant fee recognition is also at play here. But we wouldn\u2019t expect there to be a material change from -- on the merchant -- total merchant revenue side from the impact of Shopify. Yes. We haven\u2019t disclosed any revenue or profitability for Returnly. We will update you guys in September. What I would note now though is they do have two different revenue streams. They do charge a SaaS model for most of the merchants who use the product, which we think adds stickiness and adds into the fight in the low AOV space. And they also as an underwriting component, a risk-taking component, if you think about what the process that Max just outlined. We think we can add a lot of value to that, both on the cost side as well as in bringing that product to our existing merchant base. Yes. The last two quarters have seen pretty large releases. We do think that\u2019s behind us now. If you look at the allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment at 5.2%, think that\u2019s in the Zip code of a pretty safe number but not something we would see materially decline from here. Yes. We did not actually see a big change in terms of 0%. I mean, I think the biggest driver is that long-term 0% program with Peloton, which clearly did come down in total. But otherwise, I think the 0% business was flat year-on-year for the same period. So, we didn\u2019t see a pullback on 0% programs generally, and I think the biggest impact was from Peloton specifically. Yes. So, we used Peloton\u2019s guidance in their Q around the $50 million estimated return volume, and we\u2019re a certain percentage of that. And we -- that\u2019s how we got to our $3.5 million number that was actually in the fiscal Q3. So, we don\u2019t anticipate there to be any impact in fiscal Q4 associated with further refunds. I also thought it would be important to put in context that Peloton return number. We\u2019ll do a couple of hundred million dollars in returns in any given quarter. So, for us, this is a much smaller impact than 1 might think from the outside. Yes, exactly. But, we don\u2019t anticipate that to be material. I mean, when we take even the bulk of that is the $3.5 million number, which again was recorded in Q3. So, this should not be an impact in Q4. Very specifically for Q4, the focus is getting to GA so that the impact we would expect to be more material in fiscal \u201822. Yes. There\u2019s not a difference in terms of the trend around renewals. I think, frankly, we\u2019re probably still in the early innings on that. And that will bear itself out over the next couple of years before you start to see meaningful pressure on things like contract renewals. So, not really a data point there. What I would say though, is that we -- it\u2019s unquestionably very competitive out there in the low AOV space. If you\u2019re only offering payment for, it is increasingly becoming commoditized. And that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s so important to offer a wider range of average order value solutions and increase the merchant services that we offer beyond just buy now, pay later, and hence the acquisition for Returnly."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Affirm Holdings Fiscal Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\n  I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob O'Hare, Senior Vice President of Finance, to begin. \nRobert O'Hare: Thanks, operator. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website, including our prospectus filed on January 14, 2021. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them, except as required by law. \n In addition, today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's earnings press release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. \n Hosting today's call are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Max to begin. \nMax Levchin: Thanks, Rob. Thank you all for joining us for our first earnings call as a public company. We are pleased with the results for the quarter, which included revenue growth of 57% year-over-year and a 55% year-over-year increase in quarterly gross merchandise volume to a record $2.1 billion as our product offerings continue to resonate with consumers and merchants alike. \n In the second quarter, we also grew active consumers by 52% and our merchant base by 90% from the prior year. Michael will provide more details on our second quarter performance in a few minutes, but since this is our first earnings call, I'd like to spend some time providing a brief overview of Affirm, the industry tailwinds driving our growth and our strategic initiatives. \n Affirm was founded almost a decade ago with the mission to build honest financial products that improve lives. We knew that consumers were tired of the constant penalties like late fees and deferred interest from credit cards. And we knew that merchants needed new payment solutions that could help them attract and retain customers while avoiding discounts and promotional gimmicks, which can dilute their brands and their bottom lines. \n Since the beginning, we focused on building a new kind of payment network, the first to align its own success with the success of both consumers and merchants. Affirm wins when our consumers and our merger partners win. In the last 12 months, we've empowered 4.5 million consumers to take control of their finances, enabling them to pay for the things they want and need over time, almost anywhere in the U.S. We've also helped merchants drive growth by adding new customers, accelerating sales and increasing conversion. We've enabled over $12.7 billion in transactions in the past 4.5 years, and we've never charged a late fee or $0.01 of deferred interest. \n Our approach has led to trusted relationships on both sides of the commerce ecosystem. Our payment platform has enabled us to advance our mission and enhance the role we play at the center of commerce for both consumers and merchants. \n Before I go into the details of what we have built so far and where we're headed, I wanted to give you a sense for how consumers feel about Affirm in their own words. For example, a military mom, who otherwise would not have been able to attend the graduation of her kids, told us, \"To make it to their graduations, I was able to get tickets through Affirm and make payments on such expensive plane tickets that I would not normally be able to get. It's been so nice. Payments are reasonable and the app is easy to use.\" \n Another satisfied consumer, \"For a company to be completely honest about no late fees and working with you on timing of payments is a godsend. I couldn't thank Affirm enough for being such a great company.\" We have received many more testimonials such as these which validate our founding mission and empower us to deliver on that mission every single day. \n Our platform consists of 3 core solutions: a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers, a merchant commerce technology solution and our Affirm app. Our point-of-sale payment solution gives consumers control and flexibility at merchant checkout. After selecting Affirm as a payment option, consumers enter up to 5 pieces of information and then choose how they wish to pay. Payment schedules include biweekly and monthly options and terms range from as little as 6 weeks to as long as 48 months. \n Our merchant technology solutions help merchants from small businesses to the world's largest retailers, more efficiently reach new consumers and drive incremental sales. Not only do we enable merchants to address affordability and increase their customers' purchasing power, we also provide them with valuable, high-quality data that they cannot get elsewhere. This includes item-level data, prepayment data, consumer behavior data and repeat purchase data. These insights can be used to more efficiently target customers, tailor promotions and achieve a greater return on marketing spend. \n And third, the Affirm app also knows our marketplace is where consumers can discover relevant merchants and get exclusive offers tailored to their spending and shopping habits. In addition to being a great tool for consumers, it's also valued by merchants. Merchants love that their outreach can be highly targeted through placement on our app, making it a great vehicle for customer acquisition. The app also offers consumers an Affirm virtual card that can be used almost anywhere in the U.S., a simple interface where they can manage their payments and a place to open a high-yield savings account. In the December quarter, approximately 1.2 million transactions originated from Affirm Properties, twice as many as we saw in the same period last year and approximately 1/3 of our overall transaction volume. \n As we look to expand our current network, there are several strong tailwinds powering our business and combining to create a massive and durable opportunity for Affirm. Consumers, particularly millennials and Gen Z, have lost trust in financial institutions and increasingly prefer more flexible and innovative digital payment solutions in lieu of traditional credit payment options. In 2020, these younger generations represented over 160 million U.S. consumers with more than $2.5 trillion in estimated spending power. \n Additionally, every element of commerce is moving online. Even as total worldwide retail sales declined by 3% in 2020, retail e-commerce boomed, increasing by 27.6%. The significant change in consumer behavior, coupled with the fact that the cost to acquire a customer and convert to sale are 2 of the biggest challenges facing merchants, are fueling demand for Affirm. \n By continuing to leverage our core strengths and competitive advantages, we believe we can capture an even larger portion of the ecosystem we've set out to reinvent. Our proprietary technology is custom-built from the ground up so we don't have the constraints of legacy systems. This means we can efficiently respond to changes in the world, scale quickly and innovate on new products. And we've maximized the value of our data to benefit our consumers and merchants, leveraging item-level data, repayment data, consumer behavior data and repeat purchase data to more finely priced transactions and personalize experiences, all while managing risk. \n Further, our ability to service all transactions from low AOV to high AOV, online and off-line, our flexible payment terms and the breadth and depth of our merchant and partner network set us apart. As a result, we see strong consumer satisfaction. In calendar year 2020, approximately 67% of purchases were made by repeat Affirm users. And we're proud to have earned a Net Promoter Score of 78, a score that is on par with some of the most admired tech brands and significantly higher than the scores of traditional financial institutions. \n We can accommodate and partner with merchants regardless of industry size, AOV or customer profile. During the quarter, we generated significant traction with new merchants, growing our affiliate merchant base to over 650 paying merchants. Our merchant wins range from Alice and Olivia, Tom Ford International, to Neiman Marcus and Williams-Sonoma, to some of the largest brands in the world. We recently signed an agreement with American Airlines and expect to be available on aa.com in the American Airlines app soon. Most excited about the new 3-year agreement with Walmart that we signed in January. This wide range of marquee brands demonstrates our broad merchant appeal. \n We also added new strategic partnerships in the quarter that increase our access to millions more consumers and hundreds of thousands of merchants. For example, we recently launched with Adyen, a global omnichannel payment platform for many of the world's leading businesses as well as Inntopia, positioning Affirm as a leader in the ski resort and ticketing space. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our partnership with Shopify, first announced last summer. We are currently in beta with nearly 100 merchants and have been very pleased with our results so far. Our partnership with Shopify is enabled through our point-of-sale API products, which allows partner platforms to deliver buy-now-pay-later with a customized user experience to the merchants and consumers that are on their platform. The deeper integration for external commerce platforms enables us to offer Affirm as a service to any partner. \n Similarly, in December, Rakuten, a leading cash-back shopping platform, debuted with us as the launch partner for our marketplace API, which allows consumer shopping platforms to offer their customers Affirm financing via virtual carts. We're excited to augment our strong merchant and consumer networks through these large, high-growth partners like Shopify, Rakuten and many others. \n Just a few weeks ago, we made our first strategic acquisition, purchasing PayBright, one of Canada's leading buy-now-pay-later providers. We expect PayBright's complementary merchant relationships and first-mover advantage in Canada to enable us to expand our scale and reach across North America. We're very pleased with our results on the acquisition so far with GMV performance in Canada exceeding our expectations quarter-to-date with growth in both split-pay and pay-monthly offerings. Key merchants driving this growth include Samsung, both online and in-store, as well as Hudson's Bay, Canada's largest department store retailer. \n As we look ahead, we believe we can address not only the $600 billion of e-commerce spent in the U.S., but the $7.6 trillion of card spent, processed online and off-line at merchants in the United States. Furthermore, by continuing to bring merchants new, high-quality and loyal customers, we believe we can address a large portion of the estimated $1 trillion they spend on customer acquisition. \n We have successfully demonstrated how our solutions can enable and accelerate commerce for larger, more considered purchases. A key principle of our next phase of growth is to expand into higher frequency purchases by investing in our split-pay product, ramping up our partnership with Shopify and making strategic investments in marketing. \n We also made our first foray into brand marketing in the second quarter with a holiday campaign that featured Keke Palmer and focused on the benefits of Affirm over traditional credit cards. The campaign was amplified by Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Late Show with James Corden, Hasan Minhaj, Whitney Cummings, Ashley Park and other prominent personalities. \n During the holiday season, Affirm was prominently featured in more than 100 merchants' marketing and advertising. The response to these marketing efforts has been very positive, and we have seen a 10-point increase in brand awareness quarter-over-quarter. We believe these actions combined position us well to increase engagement with both consumers and merchants, leading to increased transaction volume on our platform. \n We also see significant opportunity to develop new products that can define the future of commerce and plan to continue making investments to drive growth. Take our savings product, for example. We've seen an interesting halo effect where our savings account growth has benefited from marketing and communications to our customer base that are focused on other products. And while our savings product isn't a large part of our business right now, it is great to see our existing consumers use savings accounts to deepen their engagement with Affirm and to see how new consumers start their permanent relationship with a non-lending product. \n In addition, we've introduced split pay across our point of sale, merchant platforms and in our app. The split-pay product, which is suited to higher frequency, lower AOV purchases, showed approximately 71% higher repeat transaction rate than our core installment loan product over the November-December holiday period. And while we got our start in the high AOV segment and have expanded into the lower AOV, more frequent purchase area, we believe there's ample opportunity to further expand our use cases, eventually, even addressing the largest category of all: daily spend. \n We expect all of this and more to further our ability to expand our consumer and merchant base, help our merchants grow their revenue on our platform and develop new innovative solutions to establish the ubiquity of our network and breadth of our platform. \n Finally, I want to thank all of our Affirm-ers for their incredible dedication to our mission over the last 9 years. Each day, you strive to put consumers back in control of their finances, aimed to be a powerful revenue accelerator for merchants. I'm so grateful for you and so proud of how we're transforming commerce. \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Michael to discuss our second quarter financial results. \nMichael Linford: Thanks, Max, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into our fiscal second quarter 2021 results, I first want to talk about our business model and capital funding models. \n We measure our success across a number of merchant and consumer KPIs, including gross merchandise value, or GMV; the total dollar amount of all transactions on our platform in the period, net of refund; active consumers, defined as a consumer who engages in at least 1 transaction on our platform in the previous 12 months; and transactions per active consumer, the average number of transactions that an active consumer has conducted on the platform in the previous 12 months. \n As Max has mentioned, our business model is aligned with the interest of both consumers and merchants. We've proven that aligning incentives can result in great outcomes for our consumers, our merchants and Affirm. We generate revenue in several different ways. First, merchant partners are charged a fee on each transaction processed through the Affirm platform. We refer to this as the merchant discount rate, or MDR. We also generate revenue through interest earned on consumer loans we hold on our balance sheet purchased from our originating bank partners. \n In recent quarters, roughly 54% of our loans by GMV, carried an interest rate borne by the consumer. A smaller portion of our revenue comes from interchange fees earned when consumers use our virtual card for purchases on or offline. While virtual card revenue has contributed roughly 5% of our total revenue in recent periods, it represents an important product capability that allows consumers to use Affirm's products at any U.S. merchant that accepts a credit card. Additionally, we sell a portion of the loans originating in our platform to third-party investors and recognize a gain or loss on the sale of these loans. \n Lastly, we earn a fee for providing loan services on behalf of third-party investors that have purchased consumer loans from us. Our transaction costs are made up of: loss-on-loan purchase commitment; a loss incurred on a subset of loans, which we purchased from our originating bank partner at a price that is above the loan's fair market value (this mainly occurs with 0% APR loans and loans with below-market interest rates); provision for credit losses, which consists of amounts charged against income during the period to maintain an allowance for all future expected credit losses; funding costs, which consists of the interest expense we incur on our borrowings and the amortization of fees and other costs incurred in connection with our funding facilities and consolidated securitization; and lastly, processing and servicing expense, which consists primarily of payment processing fees, third-party customer support and collection expenses, salaries and personnel-related costs of our customer care team and allocated overhead. \n We fund our business through 3 primary channels: warehouse credit facilities where we borrow against loans retained in our balance sheet; forward flow relationships where we sell loans to third-party investors; and securitization vehicles, where we bundled consumer loans into structured debt offerings. \n In January 2021, we entered into our first revolving credit agreement with the syndicated commercial banks for an unsecured revolving credit facility to further enhance our corporate liquidity, though the facility remains undrawn to date. We currently have no other drawn corporate debt on our balance sheet. \n Our funding model is built to be durable and resilient, as demonstrated during the pandemic. Not only were we able to retain our existing funding, but we added over $2 billion of additional committed capital and introduced 2 securitization programs into our ecosystem in calendar year 2020. We were able to do this in large part because of the high-quality assets we produce, which generate predictable servicing and interest income. Additionally, the assets we hold in our balance sheet are short in duration and thus do not need to withstand multiple credit cycles. \n Our performance during COVID-19 highlighted the quality of our assets and the capabilities of our proprietary risk management and underwriting approach. \n As of December 31, 2020, our delinquency rates, as a percentage of our loan portfolio and excluding the impact of our payment deferral program, were approximately 41% lower as compared to June 30, 2020, and 63% lower as compared to December 31, 2019. \n In addition, as of December 31, 2020, our trailing 3-month gross charge-off, as a percentage of loan portfolio and excluding the impact of our payment deferral program, were approximately 53% lower as compared to June 30, 2020, and 67% lower as compared to December 31, 2019. \n As a result of our consistent loan performance and strong investor demand for our assets, we have been able to expand our platform at scale, while decreasing the equity capital requirement of our loan business. While we added $1.5 billion to our total platform loan portfolio in calendar year 2020, the relative equity capital required to service the portfolio decreased from 10% as of December 31, 2019, to 8% as of December 31, 2020. \n Turning now to our fiscal second quarter results for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020. GMV increased 55% year-on-year to $2.1 billion. The increase in GMV was driven primarily by the 90% expansion of our active merchant base to approximately 7,890 at the end of the quarter from approximately 4,148 active merchants in the same time last year, and organic growth in active consumers which grew approximately 52% year-on-year to $4.5 million. \n Providing a little more color on the composition of GMV, we typically assess our GMV mix across a few different dimensions. First, 0% versus interest-bearing GMV. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, 0% APR loans accounted for 46% of our total GMV compared to 40% for the 3 months ended December 31, 2019. \n Affirm versus non-Affirm-initiated transactions. We track the portion of transactions originated on our Affirm's owned properties to assess the strength of our consumer network. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2020, 32% of our transactions occurred on the Affirm's property compared to 26% in the same quarter last fiscal year. \n Industry diversification. We believe the diversity of our merchant partners provides our business with a unique competitive offering as we are not tied to any one sector of the economy. During the 3 months ended December 31, 2020, no one segment accounted for more than 31% of our volume. Over the last 12 months, the largest and fastest-growing segments were sporting goods and outdoors, which includes merchants such as Peloton, Mirror and Rad Power Bikes; and home and lifestyle, which includes merchants such as Purple, Wayfair and West Elm. Both of these segments had pandemic tailwinds. \n Conversely, our small segment over the last 12 months was travel and ticketing, which declined 47% year-on-year and fell from 11% of our volume in calendar year 2019 to only 3% in calendar year 2020. Notable merchants in this space include marquee brands such as Expedia, Priceline and Delta Vacations. \n The strong GMV growth drove an increase in total revenue of $74.1 million or 57% compared to the same period last year. Total revenue as a percentage of GMV was 10%, an increase of approximately 14 basis points compared to the same period last year. Total transaction costs increased 23% year-on-year, significantly less than the 57% annual growth in revenue to $114.1 million. \n Transaction costs as a percentage of GMV were 5.5%, a decrease of approximately 141 basis points compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 59% increase in loss and loan purchase commitment due to a significant increase in the proportion of 0% loans purchased from our originating bank partners during the period and a 48% increase in funding costs, primarily due to a 99% increase in our average debt balances, corresponding to our 81% increase in average loans held for investment, and partially offset by a significantly lower average market interest rate. \n Our debt balances included only funding debts in fiscal year Q2 2020, and now will also include our fixed rate notes held by securitization trust issued during the current fiscal year; and a 44% increase in processing and servicing expenses, primarily due to an increase in third-party loan servicing and collection costs and an increase in payment processing fees due to an increase in servicing activity and payments volume. These increases were partially offset by a 42% decrease in provision for credit losses due to lower credit losses and improved credit quality. \n For all loans which we retain on our balance sheet, we are required to hold an allowance for credit losses. The provision for credit losses is generally determined by the change in estimates for future losses and the net charge-offs that occur in the period. \n During the 3 months that ended December 31, 2020, a stronger-than-expected credit performance of the existing portfolio and an improved credit outlook resulted in a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. This decrease was offset by allowances recorded on loans retained during the period with higher credit quality and a similarly improved credit outlook as the balances of loans held for investment continued to increase, resulting in provision expense of $17.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2020. \n The combination of the decrease in allowance for credit losses in the 3 months ended December 31, 2020, and the overall credit quality improvement relative to the 3 months ended December 31, 2019, led the provision for credit losses to decrease by $12.7 million or 42% compared to the 3 months ending December 31, 2019, despite the growth in the balance of loans held for investment. \n Total revenue less transaction cost was $89.9 million in the second quarter, up 141% year-on-year. As a percentage of total revenues, total revenue less transaction cost was 44% as compared to 29% in the prior year period. Total revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of GMV was 4%, an increase of approximately 155 basis points compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by a release of allowance for credit losses due to strong credit performance in our loan portfolio, which resulted in lower provision expense. \n Technology and data analytics expense increased by $10 million or 32% year-on-year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in engineering, product and data science personnel costs as well as to an increase in the data infrastructure and hosting costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in underwriting data provider costs. \n Sales and marketing expense increased by $31.5 million or 411% year-on-year. This increase was primarily due to $17 million of noncash expense associated with the amortization of an asset associated with our commercial agreement with Shopify, which was executed in July 2020. Additionally, there was a $10.7 million increase in brand and consumer marketing, driven by our holiday shopping and brand activation marketing campaign, which resulted in a meaningful inclusion in over 100 merchants' marketing advertising over the holidays. Furthermore, we incurred $0.8 million of onetime marketing costs and professional fees resulting from our initial public offering. \n General and administrative expenses increased by $10.2 million or 33% year-on-year. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $4.5 million in personnel costs as we grew headcount in our finance, legal, operations, and administrative organizations. Additionally, professional fees increased by $4.3 million during the period to support the PayBright acquisition, our initial public offering and regulatory and compliance programs. G&A expenses included $2 million of onetime costs associated with our initial public offering and the acquisition of PayBright. \n Operating loss in the second quarter was $31.7 million as compared to $32.6 million in the prior year period. Excluding our noncash Shopify expenses, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses and onetime costs associated with our initial public offering and the acquisition of PayBright, adjusted operating loss was $1.8 million as compared to $21.1 million in the year ago period. In the second quarter, net loss increased to $31.6 million from $31 million in the same period last year. \n Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on January 15, 2021, we closed our initial public offering of 28.3 million shares of a Class A common stock at an offering price of $49 per share. The proceeds before expenses to us on the IPO were approximately $1.3 billion. \n A couple of things to keep in mind when thinking about our fiscal third quarter. In December, Peloton began delaying the capture of transactions based on shipment date, which is a change from the previous approach of capturing funds at check-out. This change resulted in approximately $83.9 million of GMV, not captured in the current period, shifting a significant amount of revenue from our fiscal second quarter into future fiscal quarters. The effects of this are reflected in our guidance below. \n Additionally, our third quarter results will be the first to include the financial impact of the PayBright acquisition. \n We are providing the following guidance for our fiscal third quarter and fiscal year '21 based upon our current assumptions. For our fiscal third quarter ending March 31, 2021, we expect GMV of $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion, revenue of $185 million to $195 million, transaction costs of $125 million to $130 million, revenue less transaction costs of $60 million to $65 million, adjusted operating loss of $47.5 million to $52.5 million and a share count of 226 million. \n For our fiscal year 2021, ending June 30, 2021, we expect GMV of $7.25 billion to $7.35 billion, revenue of $760 million to $780 million, transaction costs of $500 million to $510 million, revenue less transaction costs of $260 million to $270 million, adjusted operating loss of $120 million to $130 million and a share count of 155 million. \n Thank you again for joining the call today. We are now happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: Wanted to ask just on consumer behavior, Max, and kind of what you're seeing there in terms of engagement and how people are kind of moving between originating or finding things through the Affirm platform versus through merchants where you already have acceptance? Just trying to see where there's some cross benefits there from your perspective on what you can track? \n And then quickly, Michael, you made some -- you highlighted some of the improvements in loan performance, et cetera, on various metrics. Can you maybe give a little bit of color as to what you think the key drivers of those improvements are? \nMax Levchin: So I think we said it in the prepared remarks, which I'm sure one could use to watch paint dry. On the order of 1/3 of our transactions are now originated on Affirm properties. And vast majority of that are existing users coming back and using Affirm as a starting point in their shopping journey. And so I think that sort of speaks for itself. Part of our value proposition to the end customer isn't just, hey, you find us as the checkout counter, and we are a better, more transparent, perhaps even lower-priced way to pay, but also a great way to discover merchants that offer sometimes 0 interest and in our case, it'd be true 0 interest transactions and also just have very interesting things to share with the customers. And so the Affirm platform in the form of our app, the marketplace is growing very nicely and we are investing in that area very heavily. Michael, you want to add? I think you're still muted, Michael. \nMichael Linford: So, James, in response -- yes. Sorry. In response to your second question, James. The quantifiables are around the DQs and the gross charge-offs both of which are down materially to last year. The key drivers are a function of the credit posture that we took this summer, right? So even though our book turns over fast, we are -- we still have a meaningful portion of the portfolio through the period from originations to Q1. And that credit posture was obviously tighter than where we were in the prior period. \n We also, of course, continue to make improvements to our underwriting model, and so what you're seeing there is just really good performance. I wouldn't expect us to continue at these levels. I think we're certainly -- having taken a more loose credit posture coming out of the summer. But I think that's the biggest drive for the results in this period. \nJames Faucette: And quick -- sorry, I interrupted you, Max. Go ahead. \nMax Levchin: I just want to -- I always love to give answers about numbers. And so the one thing that I can tell you about the transactions originated on our platform, the year-on-year growth there was north of 100%. So not only is the Affirm-originated transactions are growing, they are a triple-digit growth matter right now. \nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it. And sorry, back to Michael. When you said, we wouldn't expect those to be at this -- remain at this level. Were you meaning in reference to kind of your credit box or the -- or the performance and delinquency? Just trying to clarify what you meant by we wouldn't -- we shouldn't expect them to remain at this level? \nMichael Linford: Yes. Our delinquencies and charge-off rates are really at historic lows. And that's not how we intend to run the business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays Investment Bank. \nRamsey El-Assal: I was wondering if you could give us some additional color on your expectations for the Shopify agreement in terms of the pace of the rollout, the magnitude of the eventual P&L impact? Or any other commentary there would be helpful? \nMax Levchin: We're going to keep doing this, aren't we? Sorry about that. They're 2 different mute buttons. Both Michael and I keep -- yes. Sorry, sorry, No. It's entirely me and -- this is, in fact, my first rodeo on this one. Normally I'm confident with my mute buttons, but this one isn't it. \n So back to Shopify. The long and short of it is, it's an enormous platform. And the reason we were picked as their exclusive partner was because we are -- if I do say so myself, we have an exceptional engineering team and we build things well and we take care and take the time necessary. So we'll continue testing the systems. We improved our -- I think we added another 1/3 all the way up to almost 100 merchants to our beta program, just since we saw each other in the road show, and we're very happy with how these tests are going. We're quite pleased with the conversion rates. We're getting the integration, tightness, the uptime on all the metrics that we care about are doing well. \n That said, I think it's foolish to overpromise and underdeliver. So when we turn on fully, we expect it to be massive. It will definitely only turn on when we feel like it is ready for prime time, including the scalability that it takes to accomplish such an enormous amount of volume. So I would not expect something overnight, but we will absolutely take our time, and we have tried to be conservative in our internal forecast as well as what we tell publicly about when to expect this to happen. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And then I wanted to ask also in the quarter, the yields -- the GMV performance was amazing. The yields on the merchant network revenue came in a little bit below our model. I'm just curious about what the drivers there are? I'm thinking primarily mix, but I was just curious if there were any other call-outs? \nMax Levchin: It's probably Michael. Press the right mute button. \nMichael Linford: Yes, it's a good question. There's 2 things to think about. One is the seasonality. In our calendar Q4, our fiscal Q2, the holiday shopping season tends to have a little bit of lower average order values and lower revenue yields. It's actually up, I think, about 10 basis points year-on-year for the same period. So I think the seasonality is probably the biggest driver, which is really the mix that you see during the season. There's nothing material with respect to any sort of merchant pricing or mix shift around the end merchants to report there. It's more around just where the transactions tend to be this time of year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Neill with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew O'Neill: I guess, Max, I wanted to touch on the sort of long-term strategic. So understanding where the business is starting today and then the sort of higher AOV, a clear glide path moving into the low AOV. You've started to build out your own properties vis-\u00e0-vis the sort of customer acquisition channel and sort of purchasing through the app and website. You also built a savings account. So just curious, what else is on the road map? Any kind of hints or guidepost to what we can be thinking about what may come next for a more comprehensive suite of sort of consumer services? And then I'll just ask my follow-up now. \n For Michael, just going back to James' question around the credit. Is the outperformance on the provision here, a byproduct of mix as far as getting maybe more growth from partners like Peloton, which maybe skew more affluent, higher FICO?  And that's part of what we'll add back? Or was it the conservatism at the onset of the pandemic and now kind of working back out of that as we've got some more clarity around the hopeful recovery here? \nMax Levchin: Great questions. So if you're wondering why the dual mute thing is happening is because we're also on a Zoom call and my General Counsel and Legal Officer are staring directly in my face. And if I disclose any forward-looking statements, I'm going to get in trouble. So I can't really tell you anything about our -- I'll try to say a few things without breaking any rules. So one of the things that we're very excited about, and I think that's just an enormous unaddressed opportunity in the world of -- BNPL is not my favorite nomenclature, but the idea of transparent, easy to understand, cash-denominated or enumerated payments where consumer really understand what's going on is something that's ubiquitous. And it has a purpose in high AOV transactions, which obviously, we're very, very strong, and then low AOV, which is where we're now growing very well. \n There's an enormous other category that's being spent. And right now, people are still using their tired, old financial instruments with their overdraw and insufficient funds piece thrown all over it. And I think someone, and it might as well be us, will bring some light into that part of the tunnel as well. So we have really interesting ideas in that domain. The -- a lot of what you're seeing in our products and our services today will improve markedly. \n One of the things that's really important to understand is that what we think the world sees today as sort of the combined BNPL sort of products is very much version, maybe 0.5, maybe 0.7, but there's a lot of improvement there. So you should expect us to iterate on the existing products very, very actively. \n One of the things that is sort of in the content that we read before, which I don't want to sort of overlook, one of the things we have to do for Shopify that we take a lot of pride in is we basically rebuilt major parts of Affirm to actively service. So this idea of offering our product as a service that plugs into existing platforms in an organic way where the partner can offer these finance-related transactions have a single flip of a switch and all of their partner participants benefit. It's something that we intend to bring to market in really, really big ways. And we're doing it already. We built something like that to support Shopify, but there's also one that we've launched with Rakuten, which is quite a different platform and so on and so forth. And this is something that we are very excited about as technologists and also just by way of growing the business in a very different and new kind of way. I'll stop before I start speculating on which cryptocurrencies we're going to work with. Michael probably has more substantive answers to give. \nMichael Linford: Yes. Just on the credit side, just to be really clear. I mean, clearly, as you do mix towards loans held -- loans outstanding for Peloton, you do see a credit improvement. But we see the same trends, kind of Peloton and not Peloton so that has less of an effect than the credit posture that we took this summer. And the thing that we'll always do is do our best to look at what the macro environment is and we'll try to take a credit posture that ensures that we'll run the business safely and can do the things that we need to do in the capital markets while still servicing our consumers and merchants. And so that the summer that looked like us being very careful and cautious, I think the provision release that you see this quarter, this reflects the fact that the reality is the consistent trend here on DQs and charge-offs point towards this portfolio being quite healthy. And that's also borne out by the kind of active participation we have going on in the capital markets right now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC. \nDaniel Perlin: Congratulations on the first quarter out of the box, exciting stuff. I wanted to jump back in on Shop Pay Installments just for a second. I know you're in beta. I think you said 100 merchants today. I'm just wondering, what are -- can you talk about maybe some of the early stage kind of attributes that you're seeing from those merchants? Here, we're thinking about how that's going to influence this lower AOV channel acceleration, repeat usage, those types of metrics. Just anything, I guess, in the early stages there would be helpful? \nMax Levchin: Rob, it will be a little too early to say too much. I guess the metric that I am most concerned with as a product CEO probably more than anything else is interim conversion. What we want to make sure is that when a consumer comes up for a transaction in Shop Pay Installments, powered by Affirm, they don't have an experience that makes them think, \"Hmm, maybe I'll pull out my debit card instead next time because this was not smooth enough or wasn't simple or as simple as I thought it would be.\" And so we're very, very focused and this is also why it will take time. I don't want to over promise here. We want the experience of using Shop Pay Installments to be, ideally, the highest converting, smoothest experience for customers, but we have a lot of work to do there. \n That said, end-to-end conversion numbers are looking very good. I am looking into my chat box to make sure I'm not disclosing anything that I'm not allowed to say out loud, but we're feeling very, very good about those metrics. \n The other one, obviously, that really matters is share cards. Ultimately, we are as valuable to merchants as a percentage of transactions we cover for them. And end-to-end conversion is a driving metric there, but over time, it's consumer repeat rate and acceptance that influences share cards. And so I will give the qualitative numbers for now. Hopefully, next quarter, we can come back with some numbers that will be actually grounded in more than 100, which is, in Shopify's case, is really a handful of merchants. So it's a little too early to declare that. \nDaniel Perlin: Understand. That's helpful, though. And Michael, can you just maybe speak to the funding capacity available relative to kind of the GMV growth that you guys are expecting? We seem to get that question a lot. Just making sure everyone understands the velocity of the balance sheet and how you're able to fund the significant growth in GMV in these levels? \nMax Levchin: Michael, unmute. \nMichael Linford: That's a really good question. And you saw during this most recent quarter is a pretty healthy amount of securization volume. And for those who are tracking it, we actually did just -- price a securitization deal earlier this week for another $500 million in capacity. And we're doing that at pretty significantly enhanced capital efficiencies and at really attractive funding costs. So the capital markets remain kind of wide open to us right now and we intend to take advantage of that while they do remain open. We don't see any real constraints on funding and feel like we're in a really strong position there. We're both adding new partners, doing the securitizations and expanding existing ones. We feel really confident in the coverage we have. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nTimothy Chiodo: On Shopify as well. Third one on this, so sorry to go there. But on the longer-term opportunity, maybe you could talk a little bit about the potential to expand that to higher AOV or perhaps other markets or regions with Shopify? And then more tactically, if you could just recap for everyone, the onboard mechanics, whether it's different for the new merchants, existing merchants, concepts around default on, opt in, opt out? And really the heart of the question that I think investors are trying to get to is how much of the Shopify volume could ultimately become addressable? \nMax Levchin: It's a great question. So I definitely should not, cannot speculate about other geographies just because it is something that -- I think we're very focused on our home markets now. That includes both U.S. and Canada. But that's one aspect of it. In terms of overall possible reach on Shop. The -- again, I think it's probably irresponsible to speculate exactly what that number is. But a big part of what we're testing with our partners in Ottawa is exactly how easy will it be for a merchant to sign up. In other words, the intent of this partnership is to make it an incredibly smooth and essentially a spontaneous experience for a merchant to say, \"Oh, yes, shopping at someone's powered by Affirm. Of course, I want to do this.\" \n And so the intent is to get as much of the overall volume as possible. That, of course -- not everybody on Shopify sells low AOV items, that also includes high AOV items, as well. So that's -- that is where we're headed. But for the moment, we need to make sure that both the sign-up experience, the merchant -- underwriting merchant's acceptance and ultimately go live end-to-end conversion share cards are the sort of thing that we're all proud of. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. \nBryan Keane: Congrats on the first quarter as a public company. I wanted to ask about that travel area. The volumes obviously came off significantly. I think you said it was only 3% in 2020. When do you guys think -- or when do you -- have you modeled any kind of a spring back in that by even Q4 or is that going to be more of a fiscal year '22 phenomenon? And when does American Airlines start ramping up into there? That'll also help, I'm sure. \nMax Levchin: I'll answer qualitatively and let Michael answer to the modeling parts of it. Michael start unmuting yourself now. So American, obviously, it's a very recent deal. And so we're super excited about it and we think it's going to be incredibly valuable for us; not to in any way, disparage or to diminish our existing extremely awesome partnership with Delta, which has been with us for quite some time, and we've been very happy with them. The entire travel industry took quite a hit in 2020. We actually invested very heavily in 2019 in building up both our feature set and our partnership set in travel. And in fact, 2020 was going to be the year of travel for Affirm, except it was the year of not travel for everyone. \n And so we expect, at some point, it will be quite a nice tailwind for us. Obviously, our attention to the airline industry and the American deal speaks to our intent. I am the -- probably not the right person to speculate about things like vaccine rollouts and what that really means. That said, I think I'm within bounds when I say that we are seeing increase in our travel volume. In other words, we are seeing first signs of recovery. I'm not sure if this is a great quantitative answer in the sense that I'm not prepared to say, and here's when I think it's going to get back to normal or go back to what we all wanted it to be. But I think the world is starting to wake up a little bit to the idea of getting on a plane and going to some places, and Michael will probably tell you how we're thinking about it in terms of planning and forecast. \nMichael Linford: Yes. Just in terms of outlook, we don't have a particular moment in this fiscal year for it to turn on. We're pretty cautious here. We've talked about it being more of a fiscal year '22 thing. So after the summer into the fall. Obviously, we'll keep you up-to-date if that starts to change and the volume starts to take off. But for right now, we're being pretty cautious here. \nBryan Keane: Got it. And just as a follow-up, thinking about MDRs, there's some concern that maybe MDR will have to kind of go lower in the industry as the BNPL penetration increases. And obviously, PayPal is pushing theirselves and talking a lot more about BNPL as they get into the space. So I guess the question is, Max, on overall MDRs, is it sustainable at these levels or will it be a natural phenomenon? Will -- as more volume comes on, maybe we'll see rates drop a little bit? \nMax Levchin: I think it's very difficult to prognosticate about what we expect in the future from -- like obviously, we think ourselves very special and we provide a service that's relatively unique, even in a highly competitive industry, like the BNPL. A huge portion of what we do that others can't or don't is our ability to address the entirety of the transaction values. And so in the low AOV space, it's a little bit less of a risk management and more of a marketing-centric components and therefore, is more competitive. It's a little bit easier to be successful there versus a more complicated, more time-centric high AVPs. And so I think we've proven over the years that we're very good at all of those segments, and we've done well there. \n As a technology and data-centric company, we provide a lot of value to merchants that goes well beyond \"we'll help you close the transaction.\" So we have data services. We now have this really rich collection of Affirm-as-a-service offerings that we're bringing to market. Ultimately, we don't love competing on price. We love competing on value-added and on the sort of things we can do that others cannot. So I can't prognosticate about where the prices go, but I can tell you, we'll continue inventing things that others don't have. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Max, maybe I'll build a little bit off Bryan's question from a competitive perspective. There are a number of players in the market. Can you elaborate on why you think Affirm wins? And particularly, what differentiates Affirm from peers? I mean, you're not really doing Pay in 4 for per se today. It's a much more complex model. And I wonder if you could just speak a little bit about why you think you have a competitive advantage? And maybe why Affirm is uniquely positioned to take big share exclusivity with the platforms like Shopify, notwithstanding? \nMax Levchin: So I'm not 100% sure what you meant by, we're \"not doing Pay in 4.\" I think Pay in 4 be a trademark of PayPal's at this point. So we're not by way of not -- not using someone else's trademark, but we very much have a for interest rate installments product that we happen to market under the name of split pay, which competes in that very space. Ours is better because we don't charge late fees, and we are much more transparent and simpler. But that said, the sort of idea of taking an $80 item and splitting it into 4 easy payments of $20 is something that we do, and it's performing quite nicely. \n I do agree that there are plenty of players in the space that do this particular product. The air becomes a little bit rarer if you start saying, well, what happens when you get to, let's say, $800. And that product -- $800 is too much to just put in a single transaction, probably $200 every 2 weeks is also a little bit uncomfortable from a cash flow perspective and that's where you end up having to do things that take 6 months, 12 months, et cetera. And we have products that span all of it from 6 weeks to 48 months. So in that sense, we offer consumers a choice and merchants an opportunity to offer a payment plan that is quite short for low AOV items and potentially as long as 4 years for higher AOV. \n That's sort of one of the key advantages, especially enterprise merchants where -- and platforms, which are, in fact, enterprise merchants or merchant aggregators, tends to want to partner with a provider that has excellence in technology, which we certainly bring in spades and someone who can service the totality of their customers and the totality of their products. And we are able to do all of that, and we are quite good and scalable in such matters. And so those are the 2 endpoints of why we've been selected by Shopify, why Rakuten, why other partners in the space have consistently chosen us. \n The other one, which I feel never gets enough airplay, and so I'll just keep on repeating it. We're the only ones in the space that actually speaks to the end consumer truthfully. We don't charge late fees. We don't do deferred interest. We don't do any of the things that ultimately spurs somewhere between rolling their eyes at and just get very, very angry about. Consumer brand love is important to us, and it's very important to merchants, and fundamentally what drives your transaction. So we are very keen on continuing down that line as well because ultimately, merchants and merchant platforms want to partner with brands that add to their own brand love as opposed to potentially embarrass them. That's something that we feel very strongly about, and we continue to wish the industry would change and follow our lead. But for the moment, we are unique in that sense, and we take a great pride in that to continue winning deals because of that point of view. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful point of distinction for me. And then, Michael, just on the guidance, I was wondering if you could offer color. It would appear that 3Q GMV it's projected to slow a little bit and reaccelerate? Is there something in particular behind that? \nMichael Linford: Yes. I think the biggest thing to think about in Q3 is that the Peloton capture issue we talked about in the prepared remarks, where we are seeing that take root. Ex-Peloton, we're seeing material acceleration. We saw a material acceleration in Q2, and we're projecting even more acceleration ex-Peloton Q3. So overall, very good consumer demand with Peloton, extremely strong, but the timing of the recognition of that GMV is going to be a function of when those orders ship. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Chris Brendler with Seaport Global. \nChristopher Brendler: I'd like to talk about the regulatory -- sorry, the competitive environment from a little different perspective. It seems like there's a little of a land grab right now with buy-now-pay-later really taking off here in the U.S. and around the world. So my 2 questions along that front are: do you see any impact or do you see any instances where there's more than 1 provider and how does Affirm's sort of market share at the point-of-sale hold up when there is more than 1 provider? \n And then my second question is more of a strategic question, is this Shopify deal, it seems super exciting and has a lot of potential. Do you expect to do more of these sort of mega deals where you're providing a little bit of equity incentive? Or is this kind of the one you're going to stake a claim in near term? Like how are you thinking about in these large marketplace transactions where there's a lot of volume, but potentially some equity cost as well? \nMax Levchin: Great questions. So on the former, I think history's always a good predictor of the past. And the, if you will, first round of payment network creation ultimately settled with 3 or 4 brands that are universally recognized depending on whether you include Discover or not, but Visa, Mastercard, Amex are certainly more or less on every checkout at this point. And so I think the expectation should be that there will be more than 1 BNPL brand that'll win. And the reality is we're all -- yes land grab does not sound especially positive, but I'd like to believe we're all taking over part of the credit card volume, and that is an enormous chunk of transaction volume, and there's quite a lot of growth for everyone. Obviously, we're biased in our favor. But all things being equal, I do expect to have multiple players at, at least some of the checkouts. And some of the deals that we sign are exclusive. Some of the deals are not. In some cases, we are added to an existing provider that we then have to work to demonstrate our worth by doing better than. So I think overall, we are happy with how that is developing. The question... \nChristopher Brendler: Another Shopify? \nMax Levchin: Sort of -- I'm sorry, I was going through my notes. I was busy with the first one. So the Shopify question is a good one. The two-part answer in very short form is we would love to do more mega deals. I think the structure of those deals are, by definition, unique and special. And so any form of speculation of what exactly -- what it would take to sign another Shopify is probably beyond the scope of this conversation. But that said, we are -- again, if I do say so myself, the perfect provider for these very, very large platforms, specifically because we have this enormous advantage in data and technology and are proven, scalable and robust. And so fundamentally, I don't think offering someone a chunk of your company if the mega partner doesn't believe you'll be able to withstand their mega volume is going to do anything. So the equity piece is not the reason somebody selects Affirm. It's because we're actually good at what we do, and we can take on billions and billions and dodge the ball. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael Linford for any closing comments. \nMichael Linford: Thanks, everybody, for joining on our call, and we'll look forward to seeing you guys next quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes tonight's call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Thank you all for joining us for our first earnings call as a public company. We are pleased with the results for the quarter, which included revenue growth of 57% year-over-year and a 55% year-over-year increase in quarterly gross merchandise volume to a record $2.1 billion as our product offerings continue to resonate with consumers and merchants alike. \n In the second quarter, we also grew active consumers by 52% and our merchant base by 90% from the prior year. Michael will provide more details on our second quarter performance in a few minutes, but since this is our first earnings call, I'd like to spend some time providing a brief overview of Affirm, the industry tailwinds driving our growth and our strategic initiatives. \n Affirm was founded almost a decade ago with the mission to build honest financial products that improve lives. We knew that consumers were tired of the constant penalties like late fees and deferred interest from credit cards. And we knew that merchants needed new payment solutions that could help them attract and retain customers while avoiding discounts and promotional gimmicks, which can dilute their brands and their bottom lines. \n Since the beginning, we focused on building a new kind of payment network, the first to align its own success with the success of both consumers and merchants. Affirm wins when our consumers and our merger partners win. In the last 12 months, we've empowered 4.5 million consumers to take control of their finances, enabling them to pay for the things they want and need over time, almost anywhere in the U.S. We've also helped merchants drive growth by adding new customers, accelerating sales and increasing conversion. We've enabled over $12.7 billion in transactions in the past 4.5 years, and we've never charged a late fee or $0.01 of deferred interest. \n Our approach has led to trusted relationships on both sides of the commerce ecosystem. Our payment platform has enabled us to advance our mission and enhance the role we play at the center of commerce for both consumers and merchants. \n Before I go into the details of what we have built so far and where we're headed, I wanted to give you a sense for how consumers feel about Affirm in their own words. For example, a military mom, who otherwise would not have been able to attend the graduation of her kids, told us, \"To make it to their graduations, I was able to get tickets through Affirm and make payments on such expensive plane tickets that I would not normally be able to get. It's been so nice. Payments are reasonable and the app is easy to use.\" \n Another satisfied consumer, \"For a company to be completely honest about no late fees and working with you on timing of payments is a godsend. I couldn't thank Affirm enough for being such a great company.\" We have received many more testimonials such as these which validate our founding mission and empower us to deliver on that mission every single day. \n Our platform consists of 3 core solutions: a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers, a merchant commerce technology solution and our Affirm app. Our point-of-sale payment solution gives consumers control and flexibility at merchant checkout. After selecting Affirm as a payment option, consumers enter up to 5 pieces of information and then choose how they wish to pay. Payment schedules include biweekly and monthly options and terms range from as little as 6 weeks to as long as 48 months. \n Our merchant technology solutions help merchants from small businesses to the world's largest retailers, more efficiently reach new consumers and drive incremental sales. Not only do we enable merchants to address affordability and increase their customers' purchasing power, we also provide them with valuable, high-quality data that they cannot get elsewhere. This includes item-level data, prepayment data, consumer behavior data and repeat purchase data. These insights can be used to more efficiently target customers, tailor promotions and achieve a greater return on marketing spend. \n And third, the Affirm app also knows our marketplace is where consumers can discover relevant merchants and get exclusive offers tailored to their spending and shopping habits. In addition to being a great tool for consumers, it's also valued by merchants. Merchants love that their outreach can be highly targeted through placement on our app, making it a great vehicle for customer acquisition. The app also offers consumers an Affirm virtual card that can be used almost anywhere in the U.S., a simple interface where they can manage their payments and a place to open a high-yield savings account. In the December quarter, approximately 1.2 million transactions originated from Affirm Properties, twice as many as we saw in the same period last year and approximately 1/3 of our overall transaction volume. \n As we look to expand our current network, there are several strong tailwinds powering our business and combining to create a massive and durable opportunity for Affirm. Consumers, particularly millennials and Gen Z, have lost trust in financial institutions and increasingly prefer more flexible and innovative digital payment solutions in lieu of traditional credit payment options. In 2020, these younger generations represented over 160 million U.S. consumers with more than $2.5 trillion in estimated spending power. \n Additionally, every element of commerce is moving online. Even as total worldwide retail sales declined by 3% in 2020, retail e-commerce boomed, increasing by 27.6%. The significant change in consumer behavior, coupled with the fact that the cost to acquire a customer and convert to sale are 2 of the biggest challenges facing merchants, are fueling demand for Affirm. \n By continuing to leverage our core strengths and competitive advantages, we believe we can capture an even larger portion of the ecosystem we've set out to reinvent. Our proprietary technology is custom-built from the ground up so we don't have the constraints of legacy systems. This means we can efficiently respond to changes in the world, scale quickly and innovate on new products. And we've maximized the value of our data to benefit our consumers and merchants, leveraging item-level data, repayment data, consumer behavior data and repeat purchase data to more finely priced transactions and personalize experiences, all while managing risk. \n Further, our ability to service all transactions from low AOV to high AOV, online and off-line, our flexible payment terms and the breadth and depth of our merchant and partner network set us apart. As a result, we see strong consumer satisfaction. In calendar year 2020, approximately 67% of purchases were made by repeat Affirm users. And we're proud to have earned a Net Promoter Score of 78, a score that is on par with some of the most admired tech brands and significantly higher than the scores of traditional financial institutions. \n We can accommodate and partner with merchants regardless of industry size, AOV or customer profile. During the quarter, we generated significant traction with new merchants, growing our affiliate merchant base to over 650 paying merchants. Our merchant wins range from Alice and Olivia, Tom Ford International, to Neiman Marcus and Williams-Sonoma, to some of the largest brands in the world. We recently signed an agreement with American Airlines and expect to be available on aa.com in the American Airlines app soon. Most excited about the new 3-year agreement with Walmart that we signed in January. This wide range of marquee brands demonstrates our broad merchant appeal. \n We also added new strategic partnerships in the quarter that increase our access to millions more consumers and hundreds of thousands of merchants. For example, we recently launched with Adyen, a global omnichannel payment platform for many of the world's leading businesses as well as Inntopia, positioning Affirm as a leader in the ski resort and ticketing space. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our partnership with Shopify, first announced last summer. We are currently in beta with nearly 100 merchants and have been very pleased with our results so far. Our partnership with Shopify is enabled through our point-of-sale API products, which allows partner platforms to deliver buy-now-pay-later with a customized user experience to the merchants and consumers that are on their platform. The deeper integration for external commerce platforms enables us to offer Affirm as a service to any partner. \n Similarly, in December, Rakuten, a leading cash-back shopping platform, debuted with us as the launch partner for our marketplace API, which allows consumer shopping platforms to offer their customers Affirm financing via virtual carts. We're excited to augment our strong merchant and consumer networks through these large, high-growth partners like Shopify, Rakuten and many others. \n Just a few weeks ago, we made our first strategic acquisition, purchasing PayBright, one of Canada's leading buy-now-pay-later providers. We expect PayBright's complementary merchant relationships and first-mover advantage in Canada to enable us to expand our scale and reach across North America. We're very pleased with our results on the acquisition so far with GMV performance in Canada exceeding our expectations quarter-to-date with growth in both split-pay and pay-monthly offerings. Key merchants driving this growth include Samsung, both online and in-store, as well as Hudson's Bay, Canada's largest department store retailer. \n As we look ahead, we believe we can address not only the $600 billion of e-commerce spent in the U.S., but the $7.6 trillion of card spent, processed online and off-line at merchants in the United States. Furthermore, by continuing to bring merchants new, high-quality and loyal customers, we believe we can address a large portion of the estimated $1 trillion they spend on customer acquisition. \n We have successfully demonstrated how our solutions can enable and accelerate commerce for larger, more considered purchases. A key principle of our next phase of growth is to expand into higher frequency purchases by investing in our split-pay product, ramping up our partnership with Shopify and making strategic investments in marketing. \n We also made our first foray into brand marketing in the second quarter with a holiday campaign that featured Keke Palmer and focused on the benefits of Affirm over traditional credit cards. The campaign was amplified by Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Late Show with James Corden, Hasan Minhaj, Whitney Cummings, Ashley Park and other prominent personalities. \n During the holiday season, Affirm was prominently featured in more than 100 merchants' marketing and advertising. The response to these marketing efforts has been very positive, and we have seen a 10-point increase in brand awareness quarter-over-quarter. We believe these actions combined position us well to increase engagement with both consumers and merchants, leading to increased transaction volume on our platform. \n We also see significant opportunity to develop new products that can define the future of commerce and plan to continue making investments to drive growth. Take our savings product, for example. We've seen an interesting halo effect where our savings account growth has benefited from marketing and communications to our customer base that are focused on other products. And while our savings product isn't a large part of our business right now, it is great to see our existing consumers use savings accounts to deepen their engagement with Affirm and to see how new consumers start their permanent relationship with a non-lending product. \n In addition, we've introduced split pay across our point of sale, merchant platforms and in our app. The split-pay product, which is suited to higher frequency, lower AOV purchases, showed approximately 71% higher repeat transaction rate than our core installment loan product over the November-December holiday period. And while we got our start in the high AOV segment and have expanded into the lower AOV, more frequent purchase area, we believe there's ample opportunity to further expand our use cases, eventually, even addressing the largest category of all: daily spend. \n We expect all of this and more to further our ability to expand our consumer and merchant base, help our merchants grow their revenue on our platform and develop new innovative solutions to establish the ubiquity of our network and breadth of our platform. \n Finally, I want to thank all of our Affirm-ers for their incredible dedication to our mission over the last 9 years. Each day, you strive to put consumers back in control of their finances, aimed to be a powerful revenue accelerator for merchants. I'm so grateful for you and so proud of how we're transforming commerce. \n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Michael to discuss our second quarter financial results. So I think we said it in the prepared remarks, which I'm sure one could use to watch paint dry. On the order of 1/3 of our transactions are now originated on Affirm properties. And vast majority of that are existing users coming back and using Affirm as a starting point in their shopping journey. And so I think that sort of speaks for itself. Part of our value proposition to the end customer isn't just, hey, you find us as the checkout counter, and we are a better, more transparent, perhaps even lower-priced way to pay, but also a great way to discover merchants that offer sometimes 0 interest and in our case, it'd be true 0 interest transactions and also just have very interesting things to share with the customers. And so the Affirm platform in the form of our app, the marketplace is growing very nicely and we are investing in that area very heavily. Michael, you want to add? I think you're still muted, Michael. I just want to -- I always love to give answers about numbers. And so the one thing that I can tell you about the transactions originated on our platform, the year-on-year growth there was north of 100%. So not only is the Affirm-originated transactions are growing, they are a triple-digit growth matter right now. We're going to keep doing this, aren't we? Sorry about that. They're 2 different mute buttons. Both Michael and I keep -- yes. Sorry, sorry, No. It's entirely me and -- this is, in fact, my first rodeo on this one. Normally I'm confident with my mute buttons, but this one isn't it. \n So back to Shopify. The long and short of it is, it's an enormous platform. And the reason we were picked as their exclusive partner was because we are -- if I do say so myself, we have an exceptional engineering team and we build things well and we take care and take the time necessary. So we'll continue testing the systems. We improved our -- I think we added another 1/3 all the way up to almost 100 merchants to our beta program, just since we saw each other in the road show, and we're very happy with how these tests are going. We're quite pleased with the conversion rates. We're getting the integration, tightness, the uptime on all the metrics that we care about are doing well. \n That said, I think it's foolish to overpromise and underdeliver. So when we turn on fully, we expect it to be massive. It will definitely only turn on when we feel like it is ready for prime time, including the scalability that it takes to accomplish such an enormous amount of volume. So I would not expect something overnight, but we will absolutely take our time, and we have tried to be conservative in our internal forecast as well as what we tell publicly about when to expect this to happen. It's probably Michael. Press the right mute button. Great questions. So if you're wondering why the dual mute thing is happening is because we're also on a Zoom call and my General Counsel and Legal Officer are staring directly in my face. And if I disclose any forward-looking statements, I'm going to get in trouble. So I can't really tell you anything about our -- I'll try to say a few things without breaking any rules. So one of the things that we're very excited about, and I think that's just an enormous unaddressed opportunity in the world of -- BNPL is not my favorite nomenclature, but the idea of transparent, easy to understand, cash-denominated or enumerated payments where consumer really understand what's going on is something that's ubiquitous. And it has a purpose in high AOV transactions, which obviously, we're very, very strong, and then low AOV, which is where we're now growing very well. \n There's an enormous other category that's being spent. And right now, people are still using their tired, old financial instruments with their overdraw and insufficient funds piece thrown all over it. And I think someone, and it might as well be us, will bring some light into that part of the tunnel as well. So we have really interesting ideas in that domain. The -- a lot of what you're seeing in our products and our services today will improve markedly. \n One of the things that's really important to understand is that what we think the world sees today as sort of the combined BNPL sort of products is very much version, maybe 0.5, maybe 0.7, but there's a lot of improvement there. So you should expect us to iterate on the existing products very, very actively. \n One of the things that is sort of in the content that we read before, which I don't want to sort of overlook, one of the things we have to do for Shopify that we take a lot of pride in is we basically rebuilt major parts of Affirm to actively service. So this idea of offering our product as a service that plugs into existing platforms in an organic way where the partner can offer these finance-related transactions have a single flip of a switch and all of their partner participants benefit. It's something that we intend to bring to market in really, really big ways. And we're doing it already. We built something like that to support Shopify, but there's also one that we've launched with Rakuten, which is quite a different platform and so on and so forth. And this is something that we are very excited about as technologists and also just by way of growing the business in a very different and new kind of way. I'll stop before I start speculating on which cryptocurrencies we're going to work with. Michael probably has more substantive answers to give. Rob, it will be a little too early to say too much. I guess the metric that I am most concerned with as a product CEO probably more than anything else is interim conversion. What we want to make sure is that when a consumer comes up for a transaction in Shop Pay Installments, powered by Affirm, they don't have an experience that makes them think, \"Hmm, maybe I'll pull out my debit card instead next time because this was not smooth enough or wasn't simple or as simple as I thought it would be.\" And so we're very, very focused and this is also why it will take time. I don't want to over promise here. We want the experience of using Shop Pay Installments to be, ideally, the highest converting, smoothest experience for customers, but we have a lot of work to do there. \n That said, end-to-end conversion numbers are looking very good. I am looking into my chat box to make sure I'm not disclosing anything that I'm not allowed to say out loud, but we're feeling very, very good about those metrics. \n The other one, obviously, that really matters is share cards. Ultimately, we are as valuable to merchants as a percentage of transactions we cover for them. And end-to-end conversion is a driving metric there, but over time, it's consumer repeat rate and acceptance that influences share cards. And so I will give the qualitative numbers for now. Hopefully, next quarter, we can come back with some numbers that will be actually grounded in more than 100, which is, in Shopify's case, is really a handful of merchants. So it's a little too early to declare that. Michael, unmute. It's a great question. So I definitely should not, cannot speculate about other geographies just because it is something that -- I think we're very focused on our home markets now. That includes both U.S. and Canada. But that's one aspect of it. In terms of overall possible reach on Shop. The -- again, I think it's probably irresponsible to speculate exactly what that number is. But a big part of what we're testing with our partners in Ottawa is exactly how easy will it be for a merchant to sign up. In other words, the intent of this partnership is to make it an incredibly smooth and essentially a spontaneous experience for a merchant to say, \"Oh, yes, shopping at someone's powered by Affirm. Of course, I want to do this.\" \n And so the intent is to get as much of the overall volume as possible. That, of course -- not everybody on Shopify sells low AOV items, that also includes high AOV items, as well. So that's -- that is where we're headed. But for the moment, we need to make sure that both the sign-up experience, the merchant -- underwriting merchant's acceptance and ultimately go live end-to-end conversion share cards are the sort of thing that we're all proud of. I'll answer qualitatively and let Michael answer to the modeling parts of it. Michael start unmuting yourself now. So American, obviously, it's a very recent deal. And so we're super excited about it and we think it's going to be incredibly valuable for us; not to in any way, disparage or to diminish our existing extremely awesome partnership with Delta, which has been with us for quite some time, and we've been very happy with them. The entire travel industry took quite a hit in 2020. We actually invested very heavily in 2019 in building up both our feature set and our partnership set in travel. And in fact, 2020 was going to be the year of travel for Affirm, except it was the year of not travel for everyone. \n And so we expect, at some point, it will be quite a nice tailwind for us. Obviously, our attention to the airline industry and the American deal speaks to our intent. I am the -- probably not the right person to speculate about things like vaccine rollouts and what that really means. That said, I think I'm within bounds when I say that we are seeing increase in our travel volume. In other words, we are seeing first signs of recovery. I'm not sure if this is a great quantitative answer in the sense that I'm not prepared to say, and here's when I think it's going to get back to normal or go back to what we all wanted it to be. But I think the world is starting to wake up a little bit to the idea of getting on a plane and going to some places, and Michael will probably tell you how we're thinking about it in terms of planning and forecast. I think it's very difficult to prognosticate about what we expect in the future from -- like obviously, we think ourselves very special and we provide a service that's relatively unique, even in a highly competitive industry, like the BNPL. A huge portion of what we do that others can't or don't is our ability to address the entirety of the transaction values. And so in the low AOV space, it's a little bit less of a risk management and more of a marketing-centric components and therefore, is more competitive. It's a little bit easier to be successful there versus a more complicated, more time-centric high AVPs. And so I think we've proven over the years that we're very good at all of those segments, and we've done well there. \n As a technology and data-centric company, we provide a lot of value to merchants that goes well beyond \"we'll help you close the transaction.\" So we have data services. We now have this really rich collection of Affirm-as-a-service offerings that we're bringing to market. Ultimately, we don't love competing on price. We love competing on value-added and on the sort of things we can do that others cannot. So I can't prognosticate about where the prices go, but I can tell you, we'll continue inventing things that others don't have. So I'm not 100% sure what you meant by, we're \"not doing Pay in 4.\" I think Pay in 4 be a trademark of PayPal's at this point. So we're not by way of not -- not using someone else's trademark, but we very much have a for interest rate installments product that we happen to market under the name of split pay, which competes in that very space. Ours is better because we don't charge late fees, and we are much more transparent and simpler. But that said, the sort of idea of taking an $80 item and splitting it into 4 easy payments of $20 is something that we do, and it's performing quite nicely. \n I do agree that there are plenty of players in the space that do this particular product. The air becomes a little bit rarer if you start saying, well, what happens when you get to, let's say, $800. And that product -- $800 is too much to just put in a single transaction, probably $200 every 2 weeks is also a little bit uncomfortable from a cash flow perspective and that's where you end up having to do things that take 6 months, 12 months, et cetera. And we have products that span all of it from 6 weeks to 48 months. So in that sense, we offer consumers a choice and merchants an opportunity to offer a payment plan that is quite short for low AOV items and potentially as long as 4 years for higher AOV. \n That's sort of one of the key advantages, especially enterprise merchants where -- and platforms, which are, in fact, enterprise merchants or merchant aggregators, tends to want to partner with a provider that has excellence in technology, which we certainly bring in spades and someone who can service the totality of their customers and the totality of their products. And we are able to do all of that, and we are quite good and scalable in such matters. And so those are the 2 endpoints of why we've been selected by Shopify, why Rakuten, why other partners in the space have consistently chosen us. \n The other one, which I feel never gets enough airplay, and so I'll just keep on repeating it. We're the only ones in the space that actually speaks to the end consumer truthfully. We don't charge late fees. We don't do deferred interest. We don't do any of the things that ultimately spurs somewhere between rolling their eyes at and just get very, very angry about. Consumer brand love is important to us, and it's very important to merchants, and fundamentally what drives your transaction. So we are very keen on continuing down that line as well because ultimately, merchants and merchant platforms want to partner with brands that add to their own brand love as opposed to potentially embarrass them. That's something that we feel very strongly about, and we continue to wish the industry would change and follow our lead. But for the moment, we are unique in that sense, and we take a great pride in that to continue winning deals because of that point of view. Great questions. So on the former, I think history's always a good predictor of the past. And the, if you will, first round of payment network creation ultimately settled with 3 or 4 brands that are universally recognized depending on whether you include Discover or not, but Visa, Mastercard, Amex are certainly more or less on every checkout at this point. And so I think the expectation should be that there will be more than 1 BNPL brand that'll win. And the reality is we're all -- yes land grab does not sound especially positive, but I'd like to believe we're all taking over part of the credit card volume, and that is an enormous chunk of transaction volume, and there's quite a lot of growth for everyone. Obviously, we're biased in our favor. But all things being equal, I do expect to have multiple players at, at least some of the checkouts. And some of the deals that we sign are exclusive. Some of the deals are not. In some cases, we are added to an existing provider that we then have to work to demonstrate our worth by doing better than. So I think overall, we are happy with how that is developing. The question... Sort of -- I'm sorry, I was going through my notes. I was busy with the first one. So the Shopify question is a good one. The two-part answer in very short form is we would love to do more mega deals. I think the structure of those deals are, by definition, unique and special. And so any form of speculation of what exactly -- what it would take to sign another Shopify is probably beyond the scope of this conversation. But that said, we are -- again, if I do say so myself, the perfect provider for these very, very large platforms, specifically because we have this enormous advantage in data and technology and are proven, scalable and robust. And so fundamentally, I don't think offering someone a chunk of your company if the mega partner doesn't believe you'll be able to withstand their mega volume is going to do anything. So the equity piece is not the reason somebody selects Affirm. It's because we're actually good at what we do, and we can take on billions and billions and dodge the ball."

            "content": "Thanks, Max, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into our fiscal second quarter 2021 results, I first want to talk about our business model and capital funding models. \n We measure our success across a number of merchant and consumer KPIs, including gross merchandise value, or GMV; the total dollar amount of all transactions on our platform in the period, net of refund; active consumers, defined as a consumer who engages in at least 1 transaction on our platform in the previous 12 months; and transactions per active consumer, the average number of transactions that an active consumer has conducted on the platform in the previous 12 months. \n As Max has mentioned, our business model is aligned with the interest of both consumers and merchants. We've proven that aligning incentives can result in great outcomes for our consumers, our merchants and Affirm. We generate revenue in several different ways. First, merchant partners are charged a fee on each transaction processed through the Affirm platform. We refer to this as the merchant discount rate, or MDR. We also generate revenue through interest earned on consumer loans we hold on our balance sheet purchased from our originating bank partners. \n In recent quarters, roughly 54% of our loans by GMV, carried an interest rate borne by the consumer. A smaller portion of our revenue comes from interchange fees earned when consumers use our virtual card for purchases on or offline. While virtual card revenue has contributed roughly 5% of our total revenue in recent periods, it represents an important product capability that allows consumers to use Affirm's products at any U.S. merchant that accepts a credit card. Additionally, we sell a portion of the loans originating in our platform to third-party investors and recognize a gain or loss on the sale of these loans. \n Lastly, we earn a fee for providing loan services on behalf of third-party investors that have purchased consumer loans from us. Our transaction costs are made up of: loss-on-loan purchase commitment; a loss incurred on a subset of loans, which we purchased from our originating bank partner at a price that is above the loan's fair market value (this mainly occurs with 0% APR loans and loans with below-market interest rates); provision for credit losses, which consists of amounts charged against income during the period to maintain an allowance for all future expected credit losses; funding costs, which consists of the interest expense we incur on our borrowings and the amortization of fees and other costs incurred in connection with our funding facilities and consolidated securitization; and lastly, processing and servicing expense, which consists primarily of payment processing fees, third-party customer support and collection expenses, salaries and personnel-related costs of our customer care team and allocated overhead. \n We fund our business through 3 primary channels: warehouse credit facilities where we borrow against loans retained in our balance sheet; forward flow relationships where we sell loans to third-party investors; and securitization vehicles, where we bundled consumer loans into structured debt offerings. \n In January 2021, we entered into our first revolving credit agreement with the syndicated commercial banks for an unsecured revolving credit facility to further enhance our corporate liquidity, though the facility remains undrawn to date. We currently have no other drawn corporate debt on our balance sheet. \n Our funding model is built to be durable and resilient, as demonstrated during the pandemic. Not only were we able to retain our existing funding, but we added over $2 billion of additional committed capital and introduced 2 securitization programs into our ecosystem in calendar year 2020. We were able to do this in large part because of the high-quality assets we produce, which generate predictable servicing and interest income. Additionally, the assets we hold in our balance sheet are short in duration and thus do not need to withstand multiple credit cycles. \n Our performance during COVID-19 highlighted the quality of our assets and the capabilities of our proprietary risk management and underwriting approach. \n As of December 31, 2020, our delinquency rates, as a percentage of our loan portfolio and excluding the impact of our payment deferral program, were approximately 41% lower as compared to June 30, 2020, and 63% lower as compared to December 31, 2019. \n In addition, as of December 31, 2020, our trailing 3-month gross charge-off, as a percentage of loan portfolio and excluding the impact of our payment deferral program, were approximately 53% lower as compared to June 30, 2020, and 67% lower as compared to December 31, 2019. \n As a result of our consistent loan performance and strong investor demand for our assets, we have been able to expand our platform at scale, while decreasing the equity capital requirement of our loan business. While we added $1.5 billion to our total platform loan portfolio in calendar year 2020, the relative equity capital required to service the portfolio decreased from 10% as of December 31, 2019, to 8% as of December 31, 2020. \n Turning now to our fiscal second quarter results for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020. GMV increased 55% year-on-year to $2.1 billion. The increase in GMV was driven primarily by the 90% expansion of our active merchant base to approximately 7,890 at the end of the quarter from approximately 4,148 active merchants in the same time last year, and organic growth in active consumers which grew approximately 52% year-on-year to $4.5 million. \n Providing a little more color on the composition of GMV, we typically assess our GMV mix across a few different dimensions. First, 0% versus interest-bearing GMV. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, 0% APR loans accounted for 46% of our total GMV compared to 40% for the 3 months ended December 31, 2019. \n Affirm versus non-Affirm-initiated transactions. We track the portion of transactions originated on our Affirm's owned properties to assess the strength of our consumer network. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2020, 32% of our transactions occurred on the Affirm's property compared to 26% in the same quarter last fiscal year. \n Industry diversification. We believe the diversity of our merchant partners provides our business with a unique competitive offering as we are not tied to any one sector of the economy. During the 3 months ended December 31, 2020, no one segment accounted for more than 31% of our volume. Over the last 12 months, the largest and fastest-growing segments were sporting goods and outdoors, which includes merchants such as Peloton, Mirror and Rad Power Bikes; and home and lifestyle, which includes merchants such as Purple, Wayfair and West Elm. Both of these segments had pandemic tailwinds. \n Conversely, our small segment over the last 12 months was travel and ticketing, which declined 47% year-on-year and fell from 11% of our volume in calendar year 2019 to only 3% in calendar year 2020. Notable merchants in this space include marquee brands such as Expedia, Priceline and Delta Vacations. \n The strong GMV growth drove an increase in total revenue of $74.1 million or 57% compared to the same period last year. Total revenue as a percentage of GMV was 10%, an increase of approximately 14 basis points compared to the same period last year. Total transaction costs increased 23% year-on-year, significantly less than the 57% annual growth in revenue to $114.1 million. \n Transaction costs as a percentage of GMV were 5.5%, a decrease of approximately 141 basis points compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 59% increase in loss and loan purchase commitment due to a significant increase in the proportion of 0% loans purchased from our originating bank partners during the period and a 48% increase in funding costs, primarily due to a 99% increase in our average debt balances, corresponding to our 81% increase in average loans held for investment, and partially offset by a significantly lower average market interest rate. \n Our debt balances included only funding debts in fiscal year Q2 2020, and now will also include our fixed rate notes held by securitization trust issued during the current fiscal year; and a 44% increase in processing and servicing expenses, primarily due to an increase in third-party loan servicing and collection costs and an increase in payment processing fees due to an increase in servicing activity and payments volume. These increases were partially offset by a 42% decrease in provision for credit losses due to lower credit losses and improved credit quality. \n For all loans which we retain on our balance sheet, we are required to hold an allowance for credit losses. The provision for credit losses is generally determined by the change in estimates for future losses and the net charge-offs that occur in the period. \n During the 3 months that ended December 31, 2020, a stronger-than-expected credit performance of the existing portfolio and an improved credit outlook resulted in a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. This decrease was offset by allowances recorded on loans retained during the period with higher credit quality and a similarly improved credit outlook as the balances of loans held for investment continued to increase, resulting in provision expense of $17.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2020. \n The combination of the decrease in allowance for credit losses in the 3 months ended December 31, 2020, and the overall credit quality improvement relative to the 3 months ended December 31, 2019, led the provision for credit losses to decrease by $12.7 million or 42% compared to the 3 months ending December 31, 2019, despite the growth in the balance of loans held for investment. \n Total revenue less transaction cost was $89.9 million in the second quarter, up 141% year-on-year. As a percentage of total revenues, total revenue less transaction cost was 44% as compared to 29% in the prior year period. Total revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of GMV was 4%, an increase of approximately 155 basis points compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by a release of allowance for credit losses due to strong credit performance in our loan portfolio, which resulted in lower provision expense. \n Technology and data analytics expense increased by $10 million or 32% year-on-year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in engineering, product and data science personnel costs as well as to an increase in the data infrastructure and hosting costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in underwriting data provider costs. \n Sales and marketing expense increased by $31.5 million or 411% year-on-year. This increase was primarily due to $17 million of noncash expense associated with the amortization of an asset associated with our commercial agreement with Shopify, which was executed in July 2020. Additionally, there was a $10.7 million increase in brand and consumer marketing, driven by our holiday shopping and brand activation marketing campaign, which resulted in a meaningful inclusion in over 100 merchants' marketing advertising over the holidays. Furthermore, we incurred $0.8 million of onetime marketing costs and professional fees resulting from our initial public offering. \n General and administrative expenses increased by $10.2 million or 33% year-on-year. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $4.5 million in personnel costs as we grew headcount in our finance, legal, operations, and administrative organizations. Additionally, professional fees increased by $4.3 million during the period to support the PayBright acquisition, our initial public offering and regulatory and compliance programs. G&A expenses included $2 million of onetime costs associated with our initial public offering and the acquisition of PayBright. \n Operating loss in the second quarter was $31.7 million as compared to $32.6 million in the prior year period. Excluding our noncash Shopify expenses, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses and onetime costs associated with our initial public offering and the acquisition of PayBright, adjusted operating loss was $1.8 million as compared to $21.1 million in the year ago period. In the second quarter, net loss increased to $31.6 million from $31 million in the same period last year. \n Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on January 15, 2021, we closed our initial public offering of 28.3 million shares of a Class A common stock at an offering price of $49 per share. The proceeds before expenses to us on the IPO were approximately $1.3 billion. \n A couple of things to keep in mind when thinking about our fiscal third quarter. In December, Peloton began delaying the capture of transactions based on shipment date, which is a change from the previous approach of capturing funds at check-out. This change resulted in approximately $83.9 million of GMV, not captured in the current period, shifting a significant amount of revenue from our fiscal second quarter into future fiscal quarters. The effects of this are reflected in our guidance below. \n Additionally, our third quarter results will be the first to include the financial impact of the PayBright acquisition. \n We are providing the following guidance for our fiscal third quarter and fiscal year '21 based upon our current assumptions. For our fiscal third quarter ending March 31, 2021, we expect GMV of $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion, revenue of $185 million to $195 million, transaction costs of $125 million to $130 million, revenue less transaction costs of $60 million to $65 million, adjusted operating loss of $47.5 million to $52.5 million and a share count of 226 million. \n For our fiscal year 2021, ending June 30, 2021, we expect GMV of $7.25 billion to $7.35 billion, revenue of $760 million to $780 million, transaction costs of $500 million to $510 million, revenue less transaction costs of $260 million to $270 million, adjusted operating loss of $120 million to $130 million and a share count of 155 million. \n Thank you again for joining the call today. We are now happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line for questions. So, James, in response -- yes. Sorry. In response to your second question, James. The quantifiables are around the DQs and the gross charge-offs both of which are down materially to last year. The key drivers are a function of the credit posture that we took this summer, right? So even though our book turns over fast, we are -- we still have a meaningful portion of the portfolio through the period from originations to Q1. And that credit posture was obviously tighter than where we were in the prior period. \n We also, of course, continue to make improvements to our underwriting model, and so what you're seeing there is just really good performance. I wouldn't expect us to continue at these levels. I think we're certainly -- having taken a more loose credit posture coming out of the summer. But I think that's the biggest drive for the results in this period. Yes. Our delinquencies and charge-off rates are really at historic lows. And that's not how we intend to run the business. Yes, it's a good question. There's 2 things to think about. One is the seasonality. In our calendar Q4, our fiscal Q2, the holiday shopping season tends to have a little bit of lower average order values and lower revenue yields. It's actually up, I think, about 10 basis points year-on-year for the same period. So I think the seasonality is probably the biggest driver, which is really the mix that you see during the season. There's nothing material with respect to any sort of merchant pricing or mix shift around the end merchants to report there. It's more around just where the transactions tend to be this time of year. Yes. Just on the credit side, just to be really clear. I mean, clearly, as you do mix towards loans held -- loans outstanding for Peloton, you do see a credit improvement. But we see the same trends, kind of Peloton and not Peloton so that has less of an effect than the credit posture that we took this summer. And the thing that we'll always do is do our best to look at what the macro environment is and we'll try to take a credit posture that ensures that we'll run the business safely and can do the things that we need to do in the capital markets while still servicing our consumers and merchants. And so that the summer that looked like us being very careful and cautious, I think the provision release that you see this quarter, this reflects the fact that the reality is the consistent trend here on DQs and charge-offs point towards this portfolio being quite healthy. And that's also borne out by the kind of active participation we have going on in the capital markets right now. That's a really good question. And you saw during this most recent quarter is a pretty healthy amount of securization volume. And for those who are tracking it, we actually did just -- price a securitization deal earlier this week for another $500 million in capacity. And we're doing that at pretty significantly enhanced capital efficiencies and at really attractive funding costs. So the capital markets remain kind of wide open to us right now and we intend to take advantage of that while they do remain open. We don't see any real constraints on funding and feel like we're in a really strong position there. We're both adding new partners, doing the securitizations and expanding existing ones. We feel really confident in the coverage we have. Yes. Just in terms of outlook, we don't have a particular moment in this fiscal year for it to turn on. We're pretty cautious here. We've talked about it being more of a fiscal year '22 thing. So after the summer into the fall. Obviously, we'll keep you up-to-date if that starts to change and the volume starts to take off. But for right now, we're being pretty cautious here. Yes. I think the biggest thing to think about in Q3 is that the Peloton capture issue we talked about in the prepared remarks, where we are seeing that take root. Ex-Peloton, we're seeing material acceleration. We saw a material acceleration in Q2, and we're projecting even more acceleration ex-Peloton Q3. So overall, very good consumer demand with Peloton, extremely strong, but the timing of the recognition of that GMV is going to be a function of when those orders ship. Thanks, everybody, for joining on our call, and we'll look forward to seeing you guys next quarter. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Affirm Holdings' Fiscal Year 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Following the speakers' remarks, we will open the lines for questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob O\u2019Hare, Senior Vice President of Finance to begin. Please go ahead, sir.\nRob O\u2019Hare: Thanks, operator. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the company does not assume any obligation or intend to update them, except as required by law. In addition, today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's earnings press release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. Hosting today's call are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you for joining us on this call. The fourth quarter capped off an exceptionally strong fiscal 2022 for Affirm. We have once again posted a very healthy set of numbers, beating our own financial targets. We executed well throughout the quarter, meeting U.S. consumer spend where it was. With COVID restrictions nearly gone, getting out of the house and out of town became a huge draw. While homewares and fashion experienced something of a retreat to more normal levels of growth, we were able to help our long-time partners and online travel agencies have a banner quarter, posting triple-digit year-on-year growth in some cases. We had anticipated this shift a little while ago and recently announced some timely new partnerships in the space like Agoda and SeatGeek. Despite what you may have heard elsewhere, people are still buying things online, a lot of them. Last month featured our very first Prime Day, which was as much a test of our product as it was of our systems and scalability, and we were quite pleased with the results. Running up to and during the event, we introduced 0 APR programs on numerous SKUs. We also expanded our partnership with WooCommerce, which includes extending our reach to support their merchants in Canada. More recently, Affirm became WooCommerce's preferred pay-over-time partner, replacing a provider that specialized in the six-week loan variety, underscoring merchant demand for complete solutions. And we significantly broadened our relationship with Stripe, unlocking streamlined distribution to more merchants and more consumers. We often talk about Affirm as a two-sided network of consumers and merchants. The last obvious but all important third side is our capital partners. Maintaining a diverse set of funding sources is critical in this economic environment. And from our earliest days, we knew there was no winging it with capital markets. Today, we are proud to call some of the most sophisticated investors in the world our long-term partners. Thanks to our excellent capital team, we added just over $1.6 billion of net new committed capital. Approximately 70% of this capacity came from existing and new warehouse and forward flow agreements, including a new $0.5 billion multi-year forward flow commitment. In addition, our capital team executed two new asset-backed securitizations during this quarter. As proud as we are of our results this year and quarter, we know that many people are thinking about how the economic picture may unfold and so are we. The economy is more than likely in the beginning stages of a downturn. It's too early to tell how deep it will be and how long it will last. So how do we continue building the strongest Affirm amidst uncertainty? In a sentence, we are going to be cautious in our management of risk while investing aggressively in the expansion of our total addressable market. The former means our credit posture will remain conservative until we have a clearer view of the real economy. The latter is that we expect significant growth from new partnerships, new products and new geographies. In the language of the 1990s Internet, we're widening the top of our funnel while keeping a watchful eye on its bottom. Let me spend some time on both of these topics. As we have said numerous times in the past, credit performance is a non-negotiable guardrail for Affirm. This is true because we see guarding our consumers' financial health as a part of our mission and because we remain obsessively focused on delivering exceptional results to our capital partners. We have both the underwriting technology and the control systems to deliver on this goal. We covered this in our May earnings call, but for a quick refresher, relatively short terms and individual loan approvals give us enormous flexibility when it comes to managing our back and front books, respectively. Being able to request a transaction-specific down payment or additional income information and offer risk appropriate term selection are just some of the powerful tools we have built over the years. This part probably does not need to be said, but just because there still seems to be some confusion, unlike the folks in the marketplace lending businesses, we are not dealing with the decaying performance of loans made years ago in pursuit of growth at all costs. Roughly half of our outstanding loan book is expected to pay down within four months or so at about 80% within eight months. Our mission and our business model compel us to keep our consumers' long-term financial interest in mind alongside our partners and our own. But while we expect to have a conservative mindset with respect to credit during this period, we intend to use our advantaged position to grow and to continue taking market share by expanding our total addressable market aggressively. Here are just some of the growth initiatives I'm excited about. Inclusive credit, we have worked relentlessly over the last several years to evolve our approach to identifying and underwriting creditworthy applicants left outside the traditional credit reporting infrastructure. By some estimates, this is almost 45 million Americans and we are excited to begin deploying some of these features in time for the upcoming holiday season. Scaling brand-sponsored promotions. We continue to leverage unique features of the Affirm network, most importantly, SKU awareness. Through our brand-sponsored promotions product, manufacturers have the ability to sponsor low and 0 APR deals at specific retailers on an item-by-item basis. Taking this concept a step further, we are delivering a full self-service console to participating brands and manufacturers to enable them to deploy promotions on the Affirm network seamlessly. International expansion. PayBright, now known as Affirm Canada, continues to deliver very good results, and I'm pleased to announce that this past quarter, I asked Wayne Pommen, formerly the CEO of PayBright, to step up to lead all of our international efforts. Under his leadership, we are investing in the United Kingdom market this fiscal year and plan to continue from there. Debit+. We have spent significant time fine-tuning Debit+ this quarter, focusing on the usability and profitability of the card. The transactions per active consumer are at a healthy 2.7x per week, and the online/offline usage breakdown is split nearly evenly. It's still quite early, so as usual, a warning about reading too deeply into the fine grain metrics. That said, GMV per active Debit+ consumer is over 40% higher than a non-Debit+ one. And after the first two weeks from consumer onboarding, we see near-perfect cohort retention. As you will hear in a second, we're still adding significant features to Debit+, and its at-scale contribution to our top and bottom lines is difficult to forecast. As a result, we have excluded all Debit+-related metrics from our forecast today. We are excited by what we see in the usage so far and are committed to making Debit+ a massive long-term success, expanding our reach, frequency and profitability. Rewards. One of the key preference driving features of modern consumer payments is rewards. It is the most common theoretical objection to BNPL versus credit cards. We can stop the debate. Our plan is to launch Affirm Rewards in beta this September with a number of participating retailers. As we roll the program out, Affirm consumers will begin to earn points on eligible point-of-sale, Affirm Anywhere and Debit+ transactions, with redemptions in the Affirm app. We're very excited about the possibilities here and expect to scale the program in time for the holidays. I'll stop here, but there are numerous other initiatives we're plowing away on while keeping credit performance top of mind. Last year, we hosted an event where we discussed our product road map in detail and plan to do 1 again late this year. We'll give you a much more detailed overview of what's getting built then. Before I hand it off to Michael, one more comment on growth. For quite some time, we've expected consolidation to begin in this space. Our exciting mission, market leadership and a strong cash position make Affirm an exit of choice for teams with great talent now that the prices and the parlance of our times have corrected a bit. We have no specific M&A targets to report today, but are keeping a very keen eye on the market. We continue to see strong demand for the simple idea of paying overtime and, in particular, for our take on it, supporting many transaction types and sizes and keeping away from gimmicks and hidden fees. Our strategy remains exactly the same as before, to continue building our network, more partners, more active consumers and more transaction volume. As always, I want to thank the ever-growing worldwide band of Affirmers united by our shared sense of mission and to send a special shout-out to the veterans, still going strong through the shared ups and downs of our first decade together. It's amazing to contemplate that just a few years ago we imagined that supporting $50 million of transactional volume would be quite the achievement, even as we now plan our march to $50 billion of GMV just a few years from now. And now on to Michael for the numbers.\nMichael Linford: Thanks, Max, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by echoing Max and acknowledging all Affirmers for their contributions and dedication to our mission. We are proud of the progress we made this fiscal year as we introduced nearly 7 million more people to on a finance [ph], expanded and diversified our merchant base to cover more than 60% of U.S. ecommerce and delivered very strong unit economics at 4.3% revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of GMV, well above our long-term range of 3% to 4%. With our team's solid execution, we exceeded all of our guidance for fiscal 2022 despite increasingly volatile market conditions in the second half of the fiscal year. I'll cover three topics before we open the line for questions: first, a more detailed review of our fourth quarter results; second, an update on what we are seeing in terms of consumer credit performance; and third, some perspectives on what we expect and how we plan to operate in fiscal 2023, given the macro environment, the growth opportunities ahead of us and the profitability targets we plan to achieve. Now to the quarter. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons refer to our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 versus Q4 of fiscal 2021. Our Q4 earnings supplement is also posted on our IR website. We continue to scale our network. Active consumers increased 96% year-over-year to 14 million and active merchants increased to nearly 235,000. This help to drive 139% growth in transactions, 85% of which came from repeat consumers. As you have heard us say before, driving greater frequency is a key priority as it not only fuels our flywheel but helps us drive efficiencies. Annual transactions per user increased for the fourth consecutive quarter to three transactions per year, which was up 31% year-over-year. We grew GMV 77% and 89%, excluding Peloton. Our strong traction across our enterprise partnerships continued throughout the quarter with our three largest partners making up roughly 30% of our total Q4 volume. Our volume with our two largest partners grew 27% sequentially from Q3 and are still in the beginning stages of their integration. On Slide 9 of the supplement, you can see just how diversified our network is across industries. This represents a key area of strength and resilience for Affirm, particularly as consumers shift spending patterns like they did in Q4. That said, given how underpenetrated we are today, our growth is not limited by the growth of our merchants or even broadly to e-commerce. For example, e-commerce penetration retreated to its pre-COVID trend line this quarter, and our growth still outpaced the broader market by an order of magnitude. Travel and ticketing increased to $545 million, up 87% from last year and a staggering 443% compared to pre-pandemic levels of Q4 in 2019, highlighting the success of our investments in partnerships in the category. American Airlines, Expedia, Priceline and Vrbo were all top 10 merchants for Affirm this quarter. General merchandise grew to over $881 million, 477% above last year, driven by our deepening relationships with Amazon, Walmart, Target, also top 10 merchants for Affirm in fiscal Q4. PayBright more than doubled, posting year-over-year GMV growth of 116%. PayBright bright continues to hold a market leadership position in Canada that includes merchant relationships with Apple, Samsung and Hudson's Bay Company. Turning to the financials. Total net revenue grew 39% to $364.1 million, above our outlook of $345 million to $355 million and grew 49%, excluding Peloton. Network revenue grew 39% and interest income increased 33%. Gain on sale increased 30%. Revenue as a percentage of GMV contracted by 226 basis points to 8.3%, driven by a mix shift away from longer-duration 0% loans and towards short-term Split Pay loans. Split Pay GMV grew over 193% year-on-year and accounted for roughly 23% of GMV in the fourth quarter compared to 14% last year, as you can see on Slide 8 of our earnings supplement. Split Pay has a different economic profile compared to our core 0% APR program, and the composition of these two products effectively reversed year-over-year as we have expanded into higher frequency transactions. This resulted in a year-over-year decline in revenue take rates, which we express as a percentage of GMV. However, you can see on Slide 14 that take rates within each of our product offerings continue to remain relatively stable. Our strong top line growth, combined with the leverage we achieved on nonprovision transaction costs, drove a 25% increase in revenue less transaction costs to $184.3 million or 4.2% of GMV. Total transaction costs of $179.8 million grew 58% year-over-year. Excluding provision expense, transaction costs grew 21% compared to revenue growth of 39%. Loss on loan purchase commitments declined 21%, primarily driven by the mix shift I just mentioned. As a reminder, loss on loan purchase commitment mainly occurs with the core long-term 0% APR loans. Our funding costs increased 24% year-over-year, in line with the 24% growth in loans held for investment despite the higher rate environment and significantly below the 53% growth in our total platform portfolio. On our February call, we estimated that a 100 basis point rate increase beyond the forward curve at the time would result in an approximate 10 to 20 basis point impact to RLTC as a percentage of GMV for the second half of fiscal 2022 based on our mix at the time. Since February, peak rate expectations within the forward curve increased by more than 150 basis points. Despite this, we delivered 4.4% RLTC as a percentage of GMV for the second half of fiscal 2022, well above our implied 3.9% in our outlook at the time. We have the ability to manage the short-term impacts in the forward curve with the tools inherent in our product, which Max shared moments ago, and staggered renewal periods on our funding facilities. We continue to estimate that a 100 basis point rate increase beyond the current forward curve may translate to an approximate 10 to 20 basis point impact to RLTC as a percentage of GMV in fiscal 2023. In comparison to a more normalized fiscal third quarter of 2022, provision for credit losses grew just 10%, and provision expense as a percentage of GMV declined by 4 basis points sequentially to 1.65%. Our allowance for losses as a percentage of loans held for investment declined for the third consecutive quarter to 6.2% as we continued to drive strong credit performance. Excluding transaction costs, non-GAAP operating expense grew 60% to $215.2 million or 59% of total revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expense declined 1% year-over-year. Adjusted operating loss was $29.3 million in the quarter or 8% of revenue, which was significantly better than our outlook for adjusted operating loss of 15% to 11% in the period, driven by better-than-expected RLTC and lower-than-expected operating expenses. GAAP total operating expenses, excluding transaction costs, grew by 76% to $461.6 million, driven by year-over-year growth in enterprise warrant and share-based expense of $102.7 million. GAAP operating loss was $277.2 million, which compares to a loss of $114.3 million in the prior year period. Now to move on to my second topic, consumer credit performance. We believe we managed this to a great outcome despite the environment. As we have shared in the past, we are, first and foremost, focused on managing risk. We constantly monitor the credit performance of our portfolio as well as the broader environment. Given inflationary pressures, we began to see the signs of stress during the quarter within certain low credit segment consumers. This stress without mitigation would flow through to charge-offs. However, the inherent advantages of our underwriting every application at the transaction level and the high turnover nature of our book provides natural agility. Accordingly, we ever so subtly turned our dials and gave up a couple of points of growth this past quarter through small optimizations, and we still grew GMV by 77%. When we say we have the ability to manage credit outcomes, this is exactly what we mean. Our delinquency levels are healthy for our business, and we have demonstrated our ability to grow while controlling them. We've said it before and we'll say it again. We are different from our competitors who had to dramatically slow their growth rates because this is the only lever they have for managing risk. We are confident that these differences will only become more apparent over time. With that, let me turn now to our outlook for fiscal 2023. When we reported our fiscal 2021 results a year ago, we had just posted $8.3 billion in GMV. We closed fiscal 2022 well ahead of our plan at nearly $15.5 billion in GMV, representing 87% growth in GMV and 114%, excluding Peloton. Our team's outperformance this year means we are ahead of where we expected to be in terms of market share. We believe that we are well positioned to continue growing our network while expanding our product offerings and geographic reach. That said, we think it is important to acknowledge the current macroeconomic backdrop as we give our initial guidance for fiscal 2023 and attempt to estimate these factors through June of next year. While we cannot precisely predict the macroeconomic conditions, our outlook assumes the current forward interest rate curve. It also assumes that the current macroeconomic conditions do not fundamentally change for the better, with early signs of consumer stress persisting through the fiscal year. If we do see signs of significantly more stress or if rates were to increase much more than expected, we expect to utilize the various levers at our disposal to protect our unit economics. Among others, these include merchant and consumer pricing, duration shortening, approval rate changes and downpayment rates. Our outlook is also informed by the following: first, we made significant progress within our Shopify and Amazon programs, which reached general availability in June and November of 2021, respectively. As we enter the second year of availability for each of these programs, we expect continued growth in fiscal 2023 albeit from a much bigger base. Similar to fiscal 2022, we expect holiday-driven seasonal GMV strength in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. However, we are forecasting the second quarter to be the low point for the year-over-year GMV growth, given the nearly 370% growth in general merchandise GMV that we are comping against. Further, given timing within the quarter and the product mix, we expect to see a seasonal decline in both revenue and revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV in the period due to how revenue is earned on these loans, similar to last year. While we continue to make progress with Debit+, we are still in the early innings. As such, our outlook for fiscal year 2023 does not include any material GMV or revenue impact from this product. While the funding markets remain volatile, we enjoy a strong position without any current concerns on funding our growth. We would expect to continue to execute across all of our funding strategies and keep equity capital required below 5% of total platform portfolio. At that level, this would reflect marginally less ABS execution proportionately this year. With that context in mind, for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, we expect gross merchandise volume to increase between 32% and 42% from fiscal year 2022 to between $20.5 billion to $22 billion. This would imply a 2-year compound annual growth rate of between 57% and 63% versus fiscal 2021. Accordingly, we expect revenue of $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 20% to 28% and a two-year compound annual growth rate of between 37% and 41%. The forecasted contraction in total revenue as a percentage of GMV in fiscal 2023 is partially driven by our aforementioned interest rate expectations and the continued mix shift to expand into higher frequency purchases. Turning to expenses. We expect transaction costs of $865 million to $915 million, reflecting a modest year-over-year reduction in transaction costs as a percentage of GMV. This improvement is expected to be driven primarily with the loss on loan purchase commitment line. As a result, we expect revenue less transaction costs of $760 million to $810 million. Revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV is expected to be roughly 3.7%, in line with our long-term model of 3% to 4% GMV. Moving down the P&L. While we will be prudent with expenses to be reflective of the current environment, we will continue to invest in engineering and product talent to support the robust product road map that has been and will continue to be a key differentiator for Affirm. We expect our sales and marketing and G&A expense lines to grow on a dollar basis in the year. However, these lines should demonstrate operating leverage as a percentage of revenue when measured on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Accordingly, we expect adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 6.5% to 4.5% for the full year. As we shared in our May earnings call, we expect to achieve a sustained profitability run rate on an adjusted operating income basis by the end of this fiscal year. As we said previously, we do not expect to compromise our long-term growth opportunities as we progress towards sustained profitability. Finally, we expect weighted average shares of approximately 298 million for the year. For our first quarter ending September 30, 2022, we expect GMV to grow 55% to 62% to $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. We expect that growth to drive total revenue of $345 million to $365 million. Our outlook for the first quarter also contemplates transaction costs of $176 million to $188 million; revenue less transaction cost of $169 million to $177 million; adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 12% to 10%; and weighted average shares outstanding of 292 million. While the uncertain macro picture over the next 10 months to 11 months as well as us lapping some staggering year-over-year comps are leading us to be prudent in the short-term, we remain very bullish about our opportunities. We are confident in our ability to execute and we continue to see strong underlying trends that position Affirm for further growth and success. With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. I wanted to first ask about the July and August delinquencies. Should we think about an ongoing increase as we move forward sort of a similar magnitude this year? Or can you adjust your credit box, as you kind of mentioned, to sort of engineer more of a plateau there? I guess, an easier way to ask the question is what provisions and losses are baked into the full year guide? Maybe that\u2019s the way I should have characterized it.\nMax Levchin: Thanks for the question, and I\u2019ll start and Michael can help quantify it. So probably the most important headline is that we are in full control. You should start seeing what we mean by that relatively quickly. One good metric or [indiscernible] anecdote to offer, so we have been taking a fairly conservative posture, as you\u2019ve probably heard on the call, or in the prerecorded part of the call, we have been keeping an extremely careful eye on the credit performance. All the while, our approval rates have actually gone up. So what we\u2019ve been doing in the background, and not a lot of, it sounds like we\u2019ve opened up significantly. I think the three points of incredible approvals have been added. What that means though is that we\u2019ve been optimizing credit very, very actively. This implies things like tightening in durations, asking for a more down payment, in some cases, asking for incremental income information. So yes, I don\u2019t think you should expect us to increase our provision. In fact, we intend to, if anything, be quite conservative. I know Michael want to quantify for us.\nMichael Linford: No. Just look, I think what you\u2019re seeing very recently in terms of the sequential build is what we consider to be a pretty normal seasonal pattern. That seasonal pattern should begin to abate and go down. As you know, there\u2019s two things to think about. There\u2019s the numerator and the denominator. The one thing to keep in mind is that, obviously, is the base that you divide it by, both in terms of the impact that we have on total term lengths as well as what we have, just in terms of the actual change in the total portfolio. We\u2019ll change the measure that we report publicly, but when we look at the business and think about the state of credit, we feel very optimistic that we have it well in hand. And the ultimate proof is how that shows up in our confidence around our margins in the business, which we continue to believe are quite strong and on the higher end of our long-term range that we\u2019ve given everybody.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it, okay. Thank you. One follow-up for me. Could you progress report on the Amazon ramp and maybe focusing particularly on Prime Day? How did that go for you? I think it\u2019s a new input into the model this year. Did the 0% loans gain traction? And could you see a scenario where those become a more permanent fixture at Amazon?\nMax Levchin: So probably the most important thing to know about Amazon is that it\u2019s still very, very early relative to the potential of the \u2013 just the sheer scale they have and the many different ways for us to work together. We were very pleased with our Prime Day performance, frankly, as much technically and ability to approve and ability to scale all the thing from underwriting to the web systems. All that went really, really well and our partners have given us high marks on that front. We have a lot of work to do. You\u2019re right, that the 0% is always an extreme crowd-pleaser when it comes to consumer buying. And I think both of us in a partnership have noticed that it is, in fact, a very successful way of offering consumers a reason to buy now. And so we expect more of that. As it happens, we\u2019ll certainly report on it. But the current state of partnership is nothing but excellence.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I wanted to just touch base on the transaction cost ramp. It looks like \u2013 you gave us the first quarter and the full year. So it looks like it\u2019s going to pretty materially ramp as you go out into the back half of the year, especially with your commentary around some leverage on loss on loan purchase commitments, which totally makes sense. So I\u2019m just trying to understand, I guess, a couple of the major drivers. You just mentioned that your provisioning didn\u2019t sound like it was going to be off the charts, although I suspect that has to be higher and then your funding costs obviously have to be up based on yield curve. So maybe you could just help us walk through the cadence a little bit of that and maybe some of the line items that we need to make sure we\u2019re really focused on there.\nMichael Linford: Yes. I think one of maybe the most important thing to think about is the seasonality that we would expect around both the revenue and transaction costs. Q2 is going to see, we think, a valley, both in terms of the growth rate of the business, the revenue take rates and the revenue less transaction cost. And that has a lot more to do with the timing and type of loans that we originated, much like it did last year. In the back half of the year, we would \u2013 truly, the back half of the year, we would not expect any material changes with respect to the efficiency, except we actually would assume it improves on a margin basis from Q2 onward.\nDan Perlin: Okay. And then I mean, you sound decidedly more conservative and may be concerned about the macro and the consumer on this call relative to maybe previous calls, rightfully so. But how do we think about how big maybe that cohort is when you\u2019re talking about lower credit quality, seeing signs of stress? Is there any way you can size that for us or just give us some context about what that looks like inside of your overall portfolio? Thank you.\nMichael Linford: Yes. The answer that we\u2019ve been giving folks up until this quarter is that we saw \"no signs of stress\" and that was something that was the first quarter we saw any signs. I think what you saw, though, in the quarter was all of our tools to manage that on full display. The reality is we dissolved the stress and we began to have to react to it. So I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re making a statement about things into the future beyond that. What we saw today is extremely manageable. And that\u2019s just not the case for other lenders out there right now. In these credit segments, we\u2019re trying to differentiate us is that we actually have the levers to control it and we did. And we continue to feel very good about being able to do that into the future. The statement around macro environment really should be heard as uncertainty. I would politely tell anybody who thinks they can predict where the economy is going to be in 10 months or 11 months, and I think that gives us reason to be prudent in how we operate the business, given the lead that we\u2019ve built, where we have the ability to be very careful and thoughtful about how we run the business. And it doesn\u2019t show up in, as Max said, doesn\u2019t show up enough throttling approval rate substantially. It shows up maybe in the timing and type of products that we want to launch and being careful about introducing a lot of net new because we don\u2019t feel like we need to right now. We can be very careful and thoughtful about the state of the consumer and play with the lead that we have right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nJames Faucette: Thank you. I wanted to just ask a clarifying question on the rising delinquencies. I mean, it seems like they\u2019re kind of, at least in the last month or six weeks or a little outside of where you\u2019ve historically targeted. Are you saying that through the incremental changes in the way that you\u2019re managing that, we should expect those to come back towards that 2%? Or what\u2019s kind of the right range for us to think about where those should be at? And are the \u2013 and I guess along with that, are there adjustments you need to be making to your provisioning? And then I have a follow-up question on funding.\nMichael Linford: Yes. So let me start with the second question first. Our allowance that we have on the balance sheet, which determines the provision and the income statement is that for the third quarter declined. So we have \u2013 I can\u2019t find any other words to describe how comfortable we are with the current state of credit other than we provided for a full expectation of credit losses at the time of origination, and that outlook has been improving for the third consecutive quarter. So we feel very strong about the state of the portfolio. The delinquency data that we show publicly is the portion of the total platform portfolio that\u2019s 30 days delinquent or more. And as I was probably mumbling through a little bit earlier, there\u2019s a numerator and denominator effect there. And it\u2019s a little bit difficult for us to want to be prescriptive on where that number needs to be. Obviously, we have a guardrail. We\u2019re way away from the guardrail. The guardrail, as we talked about earlier this year, is many points above anything that we\u2019ve ever operated the business at. The real thing we would like to do is make sure that the unit economics or revenue less transaction costs are still printing at really high levels with the provisions that we are \u2013 we would need to be taking. And those are the numbers that we feel really, really strong about. And on top of all that, we are hitting the seasonal peak for delinquencies and therefore would expect the seasonality trend to work into our favor from here.\nJames Faucette: Got it. And then on funding capacity, I appreciate the update there. Can you help characterize for us the \u2013 what the nature of those commitments are from a capacity standpoint? And anything that we should be aware of either in terms of upcoming renewals or where the way terms of those commitments could change, et cetera? Thanks.\nMichael Linford: Yes. Thank you for the question. So first, just overall, the way to think about the market, we have really strong demand or supply for \u2013 on balance sheet where health capacity, I would characterize, it as us having to say no and the banks are plenty willing to lend money right now. I think the forward flow market also remains very attractive with a robust pipeline of forward flow buyers who are interested in partnering with us. I think the ABS market is obviously quite volatile, and you\u2019re going to see us be a little bit more careful and thoughtful about where and when we execute there this year. However, with respect to forward flow, that capital is very committed. And we have about $200 million out of $4.3 billion of forward flow capacity that\u2019s even up for renewal in the entire fiscal year. That is to say, 95% of our capacity is mostly locked into the entirety of fiscal 2023 on the forward flow side. What that does for us is it serves as one of the many tools that we have to mitigate any impact of rates. So the ways that could impact us are, first and foremost, access to credit. We enjoy a large amount of capacity where it will not constrain growth. And the second way it impacts us is obviously in higher cost of funds or lower yields that we\u2019re able to get when we sell loans. In both those cases, those impacts are delayed. What you saw in the back half of fiscal 2022 was a huge shock in rates. When we talked in February until the end of the year, peak rates moved to the head of my note, over 150 bps. And the impact to us was frankly impossible for anybody to see as we crushed our revenue less transaction cost numbers in that period. So we look at next year as being a very secure and safe level of funding, with the upside being our team is still out executing deals because the markets are still very constructive on the forward flow side. I think the one thing that you\u2019re going to see less of this year, though, is ABS execution with the big caveat being that we just don\u2019t know. I mean, if the market does find a new stable footing, you\u2019ll see us be active in the back half of the year. But as we sit here today, we do think that there\u2019s a lot more volatility in that market. We\u2019re going to be \u2013 and that\u2019s showing you up how we\u2019re talking about the funding mix for the next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, thanks, guys. I just wanted to start with a two-part question on GMV. Can you tell us the fiscal 2023, the GMV growth guidance ex-Peloton? And then just the second piece there is if we reflect back on fiscal 2022, I think you had started the year guiding to 50% to 54%. You ended up at 87% Amazon helped. And so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much services you guys might be trying to bake in just as you\u2019ve had multiple times, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nMichael Linford: Yes. So the first question, in terms of Peloton, we\u2019re very proud that we\u2019ve expanded our merchant and category mix where Peloton continues to deconcentrate in our business. It was low-single digits percent of our business in Q4, for example, and yet, we still haven\u2019t lapped all of the contribution. So we would continue to expect that to be a declining business. Our current expectations are that it\u2019s something on the order of 4 points of GMV growth and 7 to 8 points of revenue growth that we are not getting this year or at least that we expect all come to drag against. And that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re so confident in the long-term here is that we do have to grow out of this a little bit of a drag associated with a partner who\u2019s trying to write a troubled ship. The second question was how much concerns are we having? Look, our guide is our guide. We are not going to caveat it or characterize it in any way, except it\u2019s our guidance. However, we do take it very seriously. We like to put numbers out there that we can achieve. You\u2019ll notice that the ranges are wider this year. The width of the range reflects the fact that we do have a lot more factors at play that we can\u2019t control. But our guide is the guide and yet we take it very seriously, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve missed one yet.\nJason Kupferberg: That is true. Just a follow-up, I guess, on the credit side. I mean, as we talked about, the delinquencies are up a little bit. I think charge-offs were up as well, but it looks like there was actually a little bit of reserve release in the quarter. As you mentioned, the allowance ratio was down again. So can you just help us reconcile all of that, I guess, just given what\u2019s going on in the macro?\nMichael Linford: Yes. So maybe a little bit of a brief description of how the allowance and provisioning works mechanically. So at the time of origination, we make an estimate of the likelihood, the likely allowance needed for that loan. And then every month, we update what we would consider to be the back book\u2019s drift or improvement. And so for example, we might estimate a loan or pooled loans will have a 5% total loss content to origination. And a month later, depending upon actual repayment information or the flow rates from one delinquency bucket to the other, we update that view. And it is the case that we\u2019re outperforming our own expectations. And just generally speaking are we like to try to be pretty thoughtful in ensuring that we\u2019re never under provided for potential losses. That\u2019s still the right side of the ledger to be on \u2013 sorry, we\u2019re concerned. And I think that\u2019s a factor that\u2019s probably very difficult for you to read through. And it\u2019s why we keep pointing people back to look at our current allowance rate, and that is our current estimate of all of the future losses of the loans better than our balance sheet. I think that drawing a straight line between data like the DQ 30 chart to eventual charge-offs is a pretty big step and probably not something that I would do. I would look to the current allowance rate as the total losses for the book that\u2019s on the balance sheet and then think about that number as being increasing or decreasing, consistent with the future expectation of losses.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Michael, I think you partially answered this in one of your earlier comments, but could you talk a little more about the credit tightening steps that you took and what impacts they have on the GMV in fiscal 2023?\nMichael Linford: Yes. So I think the \u2013 let me speak to what happened in the prior quarter first because I think that\u2019s pretty illustrative of what we think will happen. We might look at a particular merchant or a set of consumers or products. We\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019re able to be very surgical. And we\u2019ll find a pocket of risk that, say, is currently experiencing signs of stress. The leverage then that we have at our disposal or everything from actually just increasing the credit bar to lower approval rates because you have less of the capacity to approve to changing the term lengths, if you change from a 24 months to 18 months, your risk posture changes or requiring more down payments. Max mentioned this at the very top. We made all of those moves to manage the early signs of stress. Those are signs of stress, I think you\u2019ve seen reported in a lot of other contexts. We were able to fully mitigate those and still be very growthful and actually increased our approval rates. And that\u2019s because approval rate, yes or no, isn\u2019t the only lever that we have. We have a lot more tools at our disposal. And we could be very growthful, because we were still launching and scaling these very large platform relationships like with Amazon and Shopify. And so these \u2013 I would characterize them as truly like we\u2019re talking about low single-digit percentages of GMV on a net basis, because while we\u2019re doing those tightenings, we\u2019re also doing optimizations that open up and find opportunities to underwrite really good risk. If you think about how that informs the plan going forward, I think it\u2019s maybe a tertiary factor. I don\u2019t even think of it as a primary factor. And it\u2019s definitely true that we have a more conservative posture today than we did a year ago. But the impact of lapping the explosive growth in the first half of last fiscal year and the aforementioned Peloton categorical headwind, combined with the things like the shift in e-commerce and the discretionary spend, those probably matter more than the things that we\u2019re seeing directly on credit as we sit here today. The truth is, as we said in the call, as we see deterioration, we will pull extra levers, they may not show up as substantially less growth, but they will, nonetheless, show up with protecting our unit economics.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. Thank you. And as a follow-up, at the beginning of the call, Max had mentioned the rewards program. I was hoping you could kind of maybe flesh out a little bit how you think that will impact both sides of revenue less transaction costs, how it will impact kind of volume and costs as we go forward.\nMax Levchin: So first of all, we\u2019re launching a beta. And as we do everything here, it\u2019s a slow start, very careful optimization. We\u2019re not going to compromise our unit economics. We\u2019re not going to compromise any other metric that we care a lot about. The goal is, first and foremost, is to compel consumers to transact with Affirm more. I think when we took this company public, the conversation in the investor community and the analyst community was, well, you guys are great, but will people transact more than just 1.5 times a year or whatever the number was? We\u2019ve shown that we can continue to move that number up and up and up. One of the preference drivers is how rewarding are these transactions. And typically, that means miles or points or something like that. Of course, we\u2019ll put our own spin on it, and we are different and we like our differences. But it will be a way to give consumers one more reason to choose Affirm when they have all the choices. Rewards also tends to attract higher credit quality consumers. Just as a general statement, you will see that folks that need credit to improve their buying capacity don\u2019t care as much of our rewards. Folks that have lots of choices tend to select their paying instrument in part based on how rewarding it is. Therefore, consciously, and we\u2019re being very careful in the forecast here, with at least with that piece of mind, we don\u2019t expect to make these cost us more in unit economics. The goal is to keep the unit economics, but they are protecting we quite like our LTC rate and we\u2019ll keep targeting that. That hopefully makes it clear that these are predominantly merchant-funded. We\u2019ll launch with a handful of early merchant partners in just a little while from now, and we\u2019ll see how it goes and how well it drives incrementality to GMV. So the simple answer is we expect more GMV, hopefully, more transactions per active user should not expect deterioration in unit economics.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question is coming from Rob Wildhack from Autonomous. Your line is now live.\nRob Wildhack: Hi, guys. I wanted to drill down a bit on the revenue outlook. As a percentage of volume, revenue this year was 8.7% and the midpoint of the guidance is for 7.9%. So what else besides Peloton, if anything, is moving around in there?\nMichael Linford: Yes. Peloton and, in general, the mix shift towards lower take rate products. And if you think about $1 of low-teens MDR, high -- long-term 0% being swapped in for $1 of 4% to 5% Split Pay-type MDRs, you\u2019re giving up a lot on a GMV basis in terms of total revenue. Now some of that\u2019s offset by the strong revenue profile of our interest-bearing product, although there\u2019s obviously a timing element to that as well. But the biggest driver is just the growth in our low AOV business, which has a lower revenue take rate.\nRob Wildhack: Okay. And then on Debit+, I appreciate that it\u2019s still early but now that, that\u2019s generally available, how do the unit economics there compare to the 3% to 4% revenue less transaction cost yield that you\u2019re always talking about and emphasizing? And would growth in that product have any material effect on the target for adjusted operating profit to be positive by year-end?\nMax Levchin: That\u2019s a great question. The short answer is too early to tell. The reason we excluded the forecast is because that\u2019s literally what I\u2019ve been spending a lot of my personal time on. And I\u2019m not prepared to declare it to be ready to be given to everyone. We have 14 million active users that are very excited about this product. It\u2019s clear that they\u2019re transacting a lot more. If you drill down in that, you\u2019ll see the metrics that there\u2019s quite a lot of pay now transactions. Those obviously have a very different revenue profile. There\u2019s not a lot of risk in there at all. And that\u2019s obviously a natural drag on probably less transaction cost, if you start to think of it that way. On the flip side, we see quite a lot more loan volume, which is great, and we\u2019re excited about the incremental usage that we get in the credit that we provide there. Again, our goals are very clear. We very much like our unit economics. We intend to protect them. We are not going to compromise them. The risk associated with these transactions is new to us. We\u2019re still optimizing exactly, for example, what sort of insufficient funds rate we\u2019ll see as the transactions flow through to checking accounts? That\u2019s why we haven\u2019t pushed it all the way through to the general population. It is available but we have really not promoted very hard. So I think I\u2019ve given just enough data before\u2026\nMichael Linford: Yes. And the thing I would -- maybe to put it in context, the revenue models for the Debit+ product will be unregulated today \u2013 unregulated debit interchange, which obviously you\u2019re not making 3% to 4% when your gross is down there. And then interest-bearing, I\u2019ll just note that some of our strongest and most profitable programs are direct-to-consumer interest-bearing products. We feel really good about that side of the house. And obviously, you\u2019ll see some lower total growth and net take rates, revenue take rates and RLTC take rates on the pay now or debit transactions that happen on the card. We\u2019ve not given any guidance because as Max said, it\u2019s a bit too early, but you would expect it to be lower. That being said, our direct-to-consumer product is much higher than that. And so we haven\u2019t given guidance and not going to today, but we feel really good about where we\u2019re getting to once we are at scale.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Reggie Smith from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nReggie Smith: Thank you for taking the questions guys. Two quick ones. The first, I guess you kind of signaled that you saw some deterioration. And I was curious if that was something that you saw in the calendar second quarter. Or is it more something that you were seeing in this particular quarter? Recognize that you\u2019re almost two months into the quarter. And the second part of that question. Just curious what some of the, I guess, lead indicators you guys are looking at. I can certainly appreciate you have more insight than maybe the traditional credit card guys. Is it slower payment? Is it the balances and the associated checking accounts? Like what kind of data are you guys pulling from? Obviously recognize that you don\u2019t want to give away your secret sauce. So whatever you could share there would be helpful.\nMax Levchin: We\u2019ll give away a little bit of the secret sauce, and hopefully, it does not help my competitors too much. So one really interesting -- actually, to answer the -- probably the more kind of relevant part of the question, we\u2019ve been anticipating some form of stress since as early as January. So we have been keeping our eyes very, very open and have been optimizing credit and credit performance all throughout the calendar year. So this is not a new thing at all. The, call it, April and May is when we started taking a harder look at things just on a sort of \u2013 it\u2019s basically spending more time on the analytics. So I think the overall behavior of our credit and risk teams has really not changed in the last, what, our months were in nine. But just the level of intensity we\u2019ve been applying to the research side of it has increased and increased and increased. And the more we look, the more we find, and we have been finding pockets of interesting things that we care to correct before they metastasize to something greater. So one anecdote that I was going to share is there\u2019s a really interesting -- as much as Michael just pointed out, growing a straight line from DQ 30 into the ultimate charge-off is a bad idea, in my opinion, because there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to cure, there\u2019s a lot of tools we have. There\u2019s everything from loan modifications to collection strategies. That said, when you look at early delinquencies and how the flow rates change is a really good predictor of at least one kind of behavior. Consumers who basically say, look, I\u2019m kind of short right now, but I\u2019ll make good on it a little bit later than I was supposed to. And that\u2019s enough of a canary in a coal mine where if you look at it everywhere, you probably won\u2019t nice it because most consumers are still just fine. But if you look in the pocket, you might expect that sort of thing, you can start spotting these sort of things. And at scale, it typically means job losses. We\u2019re obviously not there yet, and hopefully, it won\u2019t get too far. But before that, that\u2019s actually a reflection of consumer sentiment about their potential for job loss, which is a second-order metric but we care a lot of those.\nReggie Smith: Got it. And then if I can get one more follow-up. And you have the slide where you show delinquency trends by, I think, cohort. I believe that\u2019s for your held portfolio. Can you talk to, I guess, what the trends look like for the entire platform portfolio? Is it consistent with that or any differences worth calling out between the two?\nMichael Linford: Yes. If you\u2019re referring to the churn we have in our earnings supplement that\u2019s titled Delinquency Performance, that\u2019s total portfolio excluding Split Pay. We exclude that because there\u2019s a bunch of goofy stuff that happens with the denominator. And that\u2019s a target we\u2019ve been chatting through today, but that takes a look at the total platform portfolio. And we manage credit and look at credit metrics. We never distinguish between on and off except for when we go to the financial statements. The actual credit measures are always on portfolio-wise. And there, you can see the trend we were talking about earlier where you saw the seasonal growth. It\u2019s a pretty normal thing to see sequential increases going to late summer months as you have seasonally low period coming off of the tax season. And so that\u2019s what it looks like overall. Again, I think we feel very strong about where credit sits today. We feel very good about our ability to manage the small levels of stress that we have seen and are very optimistic and confident in our ability to do so through the rest of the fiscal year.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMichael Ng: Great. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the 32% to 42% year-over-year origination volume outlook. Is there anything you can talk about as it relates to how each of the segments or products will grow relative to that consolidated growth rate? And is there anything that you could potentially talk about as it relates to categories, whether it\u2019s faster or slower than that consolidated growth rate? Thanks.\nMichael Linford: Yes. Just to recap again, I do think we would expect our sporting good nature of business to show some headwind. It was the only category that declined last quarter. We would continue to expect that to be a drag. We estimate that single partner to be 4% June be a headwind alone. The second thing I\u2019d say is in Q2 of last year, we launched to general availability with Amazon. And we also went GA in late Q1, early Q2 for Shopify. And as you start to lap those, you are going to see, for the category that they\u2019re over indexed in, some compression. So for example, general merchandise will have lower growth rates. However, it\u2019s from a very, very, very high growth rate base because the base gets bigger but the dollars of growth are still very impressive there. And just for a second, to be really clear on what it\u2019s not, the guidance for GMV is not reflective of the view that we have around consumer demand for our product. We\u2019re still seeing healthy application levels. As I mentioned before, our approval rates are actually up, so both the demand and our ability to underwrite. It\u2019s also not a function of any shift away from or falling out of favor of the category. We continue to see our payment method as being more important to merchants than it was in a prior period. And lastly, it\u2019s not a function of capital constraints. And so our outlook really is about the one or two pieces of acute headwind. And then we\u2019re lapping some really gotti [ph] numbers. We feel really good about the underlying absolute value of the business and feel really good about our path to continue to build a really big network at scale.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Michael. And just as a follow-up. Sorry, I know this came up earlier on the call, but could you just talk a little bit more about the trajectory of revenue less transaction margins throughout the year? I know you said there was going to be a valley in the fiscal second quarter. Is that a function of the holiday and mix? Is that more Split Pay? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nMichael Linford: Yes. So you have our guide for Q1 and then what you\u2019ll expect to see in Q2 is originations spiking, lots of originations later in the quarter. And when that happens, it\u2019s just the way things flow through the P&L is that you end up with lower revenue and RLTC rates in the quarter. And then the back half of the year, you kind of realize some of the benefit of originations that happened earlier in the year. And we just had the same trend to play out, albeit slightly more muted because, again, I think the explosive growth that we had in Q2 won\u2019t be repeated but the shape should look very similarly. And so you have our guide for Q1. Think about Q2 as being lower on a vertical basis, although again, we feel really good about the economic content that we\u2019ll be originating in that quarter such that the back half of the year will be improving from there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Appreciate you taking the question here. Max, when I look at the very impressive customer and merchant growth metrics you put up, and I juxtapose those with the very high recurring transactions you\u2019re getting, the recurring rate from your existing customers, 85%, I think, how do we think about monetizing all this new potential, both merchants and customers, that you brought on? It strikes me that for Affirm to be really successful in the long run, you\u2019ve got to really spread out monetization. So how do we think about that in the long run?\nMax Levchin: Great question. So thematically, the way I\u2019ve been thinking about overall strategy for this fiscal year and the strategy set a little bit earlier than in the year. So we think about it for a while but this is the year we\u2019re going to execute on it. This is really the year of the consumer. Last year, we were lucky, proud, successful enough to bring on over half of e-commerce volumes onto the platform. We launched to general availability on a whole bunch of platforms and having able to scale with them. And it\u2019s showing up in the network effects. You see transaction usage growing, transaction per consumers. It\u2019s also the year, we brought on a whole lot of new consumers so the denominator has grown and the numerator outpaced it. And so it\u2019s all goodness in terms of bringing on new users on to the network. And this year, we\u2019re really going to invest in just making this the very best product for the end consumer in every imaginable way. And I\u2019ll definitely spend lots of time on talking about this at our product road map event sometime towards the end of the calendar year. But just if you scan the things that we bragged about in the -- in my recorded section, rewards, I think, is going to really move the needle not just in terms of consumer satisfaction but also will make it a very compelling promotional platform for merchants. And we expect to find good monetization there. Brand-sponsored promotions is something that we\u2019ve proven to work almost manually, if you will, in some of our largest big-box partners. We\u2019re really going to put it on a conveyor belt by creating a self-service console for that and integrating in a bunch of places. We have, obviously, Debit+ is something that I am personally very passionate about. I have fantastic customer stories. Now, when I say customer here I mean consumer, but I literally had to chat with a person who went to Colombia, the country on vacation with a \u2013 exactly one card in as wallet Debit+. And in the early beta, it did not work internationally. So we had to scramble a solution for him. But it\u2019s something that I really think is just a fantastic way of increasing transactions. Obviously, 2.7 [ph] transactions per week is a massive, massive opportunity to create more value for consumers. Every one of these transactions is two sided. There\u2019s always a merchant on the other side, and they are excited about the incremental conversion, incremental volume that we\u2019re bringing on. Frankly, there are huge opportunities in demand discovery and demand generation, which we\u2019re just scratching the surface if you go into the Affirm app, you\u2019ll find we\u2019ve made a lot of really interesting improvements in item level search. There\u2019s some really clever promotions around specific items. One really good metric north of 50% of our own and operated service originated transactions basically Affirm Anywhere. And now Debit+ transactions begin in a search box, which is kind of an interesting stats that should tell you opportunities there to monetize are pretty enormous. There\u2019s a small company in Mountain View, that\u2019s figured out how to make money on capture consumer demand from search. So we have lots of really, really exciting things planned for the consumer for this year. And I hope to brag about them on the next call, but I\u2019ll stop now because I\u2019m taking up your time because Michael\u2019s gotten so many really good questions, but yes, we have a lot planned on the consumer side for sure. And every one of these things is an opportunity to increase our margins.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just \u2013 can you just speak to Affirm\u2019s competitive position? You\u2019ve had some new entrances in the market that have grown really fast. What convinces you that Affirm is the long-term winner?\nMax Levchin: I think on at least the unit basis, we\u2019re seeing more competitors, if not exit the market, then fall away in terms of their competitive position. I think the \u2013 if you look at the North American footprint, I would argue we\u2019ve established our dominance over the last fiscal year, quite decisively. Presumably, you\u2019re talking about my baby number one relative to the current baby. PayPal entering the business generally did not have an impact that we could discern in our ability to close merchants or our ability to convince consumers that we have a great product. I think the audience that PayPal serves is a little bit like me, kind of an aging Gen X are a couple of kids and a dog and Affirm serves predominantly Gen Z and Millennials audience, and the two are quite different. And it\u2019s good that there are products available to everyone and we\u2019re excited to overall see the shift from credit cards and cash to buy now, pay later. So for the moment, because the segment is so under penetrated, we\u2019re not really feeling any competitive pressures. I\u2019m sure eventually it\u2019ll come to an end, but for the moment we\u2019re still single digit of U.S. e-commerce. And my point of view, the single most exciting thing, not single, there\u2019s a lot of exciting things is actually unfair. But one of the most exciting things that we\u2019re seeing right now is Debit+ being 50/50 online/offline, there\u2019s just a complete Greenfield of offline transactions that no one\u2019s really figured out. And we think we have something really special there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Brendler from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live.\nChris Brendler: All right. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019d love to hear \u2013 I appreciate your guidance didn\u2019t include sort of a deceleration and consumer activity in this space. But I\u2019d love to hear if you have any sort of recent color on consumer demand for buy now, pay later even in the inflationary environment. Are we seeing more folks shift to this product because to make ends meet? Are we seeing more folks shift to the Split Pay product to avoid some of the longer term, the bigger purchases? Any color there would be great on just consumer behavior recently?\nMax Levchin: I\u2019ll start and Michael has a kind of it's sort of a different. So short answer is no, we are seeing if anything increase demand on the consumer side, which is exactly as we expected it primarily because inflation takes away spending capacity and you borrow to increase it. So I think in terms of need more credit that has been pointing north as inflation became more and more of a thing. We do see secondary effects of inflation. Some folks choose not to buy because the prices relative to their earning capacity are higher. And so they are thinking longer, they are buying a little bit less, but I don\u2019t think that impacts buy now, pay later if anything, that accretes to buy now, pay later in other forms of credit too. In terms of shift to shorter and longer term, that\u2019s a really, really good and important question. There\u2019s a lot of that, that we control in the sense that the consumer sees at least three, sometimes four different term lengths that we offer for every transaction, depending on what the consumer looks for. And we\u2019ve now gotten quite good with it, have to check out optimizing for the right collection of offerings that consumer can decide quite differently. Folks that are buying something that is pretty short term or sorry, pretty low AOV tend to select short term because those transactions we can generally speaking do on no interest at all. And so it really is a free loan, and it\u2019s pretty great if you can get it because just for use of money. It flips pretty dramatically when you are looking at an item that is factually outside of your personal cash position or personal cash flow, it then becomes a matter of monthly cash flow impact. And so at that point, consumers tend to choose the longest term possible because that lowers their overall cash exposure on a monthly basis that obviously increases our risk, increases the number of opportunities that consumer has to go delinquent or default. And as a result, we manage our risk by being judicious about just how long we\u2019re willing to take this term out to for a transaction. So we have as much to say about these terms as the consumer does, if not more, but there\u2019s definitely some differentiated behavior. The one thing that I can tell you we\u2019re quite right about 0% APR transactions are that much more exciting in an inflationary environment because borrowing money is becoming expensive things to the Fed and buying things is more expensive things to inflation. So if you can figure a transaction that has no interest at all, it\u2019s pretty great.\nMichael Linford: Yes. The only thing to add to that, if you look at the transaction counts, it\u2019s a really good measure for what\u2019s going on our consumers wanting to use this product more, because so many of the other things are functions of puts and takes on merchant relationships, product types and everything else. But the actual transaction count growth is huge. Transactions last quarter 139%, but the biggest piece of growth in the business is hitting more transactions in the platform. And yes, we\u2019re proud that 85% came from repeat users, but the total gross number of transactions is a really good measure of just how much there. And it\u2019s sequentially up a lot too. It wasn\u2019t just up year-over-year. We were up sequentially from Q3 quite a bit and across a really wide set of categories. This past quarter saw our travel ticketing business really dominate the \u2013 I think with people a little over 12% of GMV that quarter and that just shows you that this is not a single use product. They\u2019re not for us anyway. It\u2019s not about beauty or t-shirts on Shopify. It\u2019s about everything that they\u2019re buying and you saw that last quarter.\nChris Brendler: I hope the transactions per active customer also ticked up pretty meaningfully sequentially as well. Last one real quick, your Australian listed or formerly Australian listed competitors may not have seen such strong results recently. And you mentioned M&A, I imagine there\u2019s a lot of concern of the smaller players and I think setting capital and seeing growth slow. Maybe just talk a little bit, if you can give a little color on your M&A appetite? Thanks so much.\nMax Levchin: I want to embarrass the person, but I got a fantastic piece of advice when I asked a friendly investor, how to think about M&A to ask yourself, would this be asset best off if it\u2019s owned by a firm? And obviously, there\u2019s some limit to sort of, we think we can manage anything, but there are definitely things that are very accretive to the business. If we can find something in the space or near the space that is better off owned by us and operated by us, I think we will take it very seriously now that the prices have normalized. And we do have a very clear road to profitability and have a \u2013 quite a significant cash position. Maybe slightly more technical way of thinking about what we\u2019re looking for. There\u2019s a bunch of really good ideas in this space, buy now, pay later is this really wide surface. I call it honest finance because I\u2019m an idealist. I think you can think of it as a non-revolving credit. There\u2019s 10 different ways of calling it, but this idea that it\u2019s too confusing to borrow money, and yet credit is really important, is it, you know is a simple idea, but it seems that its time has finally come. It\u2019s actually really, really hard to do. And the hard part comes from all sorts of things like underwriting is really, really difficult. We have a lot of exceedingly smart people like, I think I\u2019m surrounded by pretty clever people. And then I feel like I\u2019m more on every time I talk to a credit team because they\u2019re really, really smart and good at what they do. And it\u2019s hard to hire that team and it\u2019s really hard to scale it and it\u2019s hard to get it to be functioning. And so there are plenty of smart entrepreneurs with really good ideas that built a really cool mouse trap, but they\u2019re just not that good at underwriting and scale really allows you to hire even more of those people and train them on real data. And a decade of operating gives you a lot of really interesting use cases that you just wouldn\u2019t have seen if you\u2019re small. And so we\u2019re looking for businesses that had amazing entrepreneurs, amazing ideas, amazing first signs of traction that would really benefit from being put on a platform that has exceptional underwriting, exceptional capital markets reach at this point, very, very large user base, very large merchant base. So there\u2019s \u2013 we think lots of opportunity will be very judicious will be extremely good stewards of shareholder capital, not a thing we\u2019re going to execute imminently. But we\u2019re looking just because the market has now reduced some of the inflated violations.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comment.\nMax Levchin: Thank you everybody for joining the call. We\u2019ll see you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. That does include today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us on this call. The fourth quarter capped off an exceptionally strong fiscal 2022 for Affirm. We have once again posted a very healthy set of numbers, beating our own financial targets. We executed well throughout the quarter, meeting U.S. consumer spend where it was. With COVID restrictions nearly gone, getting out of the house and out of town became a huge draw. While homewares and fashion experienced something of a retreat to more normal levels of growth, we were able to help our long-time partners and online travel agencies have a banner quarter, posting triple-digit year-on-year growth in some cases. We had anticipated this shift a little while ago and recently announced some timely new partnerships in the space like Agoda and SeatGeek. Despite what you may have heard elsewhere, people are still buying things online, a lot of them. Last month featured our very first Prime Day, which was as much a test of our product as it was of our systems and scalability, and we were quite pleased with the results. Running up to and during the event, we introduced 0 APR programs on numerous SKUs. We also expanded our partnership with WooCommerce, which includes extending our reach to support their merchants in Canada. More recently, Affirm became WooCommerce's preferred pay-over-time partner, replacing a provider that specialized in the six-week loan variety, underscoring merchant demand for complete solutions. And we significantly broadened our relationship with Stripe, unlocking streamlined distribution to more merchants and more consumers. We often talk about Affirm as a two-sided network of consumers and merchants. The last obvious but all important third side is our capital partners. Maintaining a diverse set of funding sources is critical in this economic environment. And from our earliest days, we knew there was no winging it with capital markets. Today, we are proud to call some of the most sophisticated investors in the world our long-term partners. Thanks to our excellent capital team, we added just over $1.6 billion of net new committed capital. Approximately 70% of this capacity came from existing and new warehouse and forward flow agreements, including a new $0.5 billion multi-year forward flow commitment. In addition, our capital team executed two new asset-backed securitizations during this quarter. As proud as we are of our results this year and quarter, we know that many people are thinking about how the economic picture may unfold and so are we. The economy is more than likely in the beginning stages of a downturn. It's too early to tell how deep it will be and how long it will last. So how do we continue building the strongest Affirm amidst uncertainty? In a sentence, we are going to be cautious in our management of risk while investing aggressively in the expansion of our total addressable market. The former means our credit posture will remain conservative until we have a clearer view of the real economy. The latter is that we expect significant growth from new partnerships, new products and new geographies. In the language of the 1990s Internet, we're widening the top of our funnel while keeping a watchful eye on its bottom. Let me spend some time on both of these topics. As we have said numerous times in the past, credit performance is a non-negotiable guardrail for Affirm. This is true because we see guarding our consumers' financial health as a part of our mission and because we remain obsessively focused on delivering exceptional results to our capital partners. We have both the underwriting technology and the control systems to deliver on this goal. We covered this in our May earnings call, but for a quick refresher, relatively short terms and individual loan approvals give us enormous flexibility when it comes to managing our back and front books, respectively. Being able to request a transaction-specific down payment or additional income information and offer risk appropriate term selection are just some of the powerful tools we have built over the years. This part probably does not need to be said, but just because there still seems to be some confusion, unlike the folks in the marketplace lending businesses, we are not dealing with the decaying performance of loans made years ago in pursuit of growth at all costs. Roughly half of our outstanding loan book is expected to pay down within four months or so at about 80% within eight months. Our mission and our business model compel us to keep our consumers' long-term financial interest in mind alongside our partners and our own. But while we expect to have a conservative mindset with respect to credit during this period, we intend to use our advantaged position to grow and to continue taking market share by expanding our total addressable market aggressively. Here are just some of the growth initiatives I'm excited about. Inclusive credit, we have worked relentlessly over the last several years to evolve our approach to identifying and underwriting creditworthy applicants left outside the traditional credit reporting infrastructure. By some estimates, this is almost 45 million Americans and we are excited to begin deploying some of these features in time for the upcoming holiday season. Scaling brand-sponsored promotions. We continue to leverage unique features of the Affirm network, most importantly, SKU awareness. Through our brand-sponsored promotions product, manufacturers have the ability to sponsor low and 0 APR deals at specific retailers on an item-by-item basis. Taking this concept a step further, we are delivering a full self-service console to participating brands and manufacturers to enable them to deploy promotions on the Affirm network seamlessly. International expansion. PayBright, now known as Affirm Canada, continues to deliver very good results, and I'm pleased to announce that this past quarter, I asked Wayne Pommen, formerly the CEO of PayBright, to step up to lead all of our international efforts. Under his leadership, we are investing in the United Kingdom market this fiscal year and plan to continue from there. Debit+. We have spent significant time fine-tuning Debit+ this quarter, focusing on the usability and profitability of the card. The transactions per active consumer are at a healthy 2.7x per week, and the online/offline usage breakdown is split nearly evenly. It's still quite early, so as usual, a warning about reading too deeply into the fine grain metrics. That said, GMV per active Debit+ consumer is over 40% higher than a non-Debit+ one. And after the first two weeks from consumer onboarding, we see near-perfect cohort retention. As you will hear in a second, we're still adding significant features to Debit+, and its at-scale contribution to our top and bottom lines is difficult to forecast. As a result, we have excluded all Debit+-related metrics from our forecast today. We are excited by what we see in the usage so far and are committed to making Debit+ a massive long-term success, expanding our reach, frequency and profitability. Rewards. One of the key preference driving features of modern consumer payments is rewards. It is the most common theoretical objection to BNPL versus credit cards. We can stop the debate. Our plan is to launch Affirm Rewards in beta this September with a number of participating retailers. As we roll the program out, Affirm consumers will begin to earn points on eligible point-of-sale, Affirm Anywhere and Debit+ transactions, with redemptions in the Affirm app. We're very excited about the possibilities here and expect to scale the program in time for the holidays. I'll stop here, but there are numerous other initiatives we're plowing away on while keeping credit performance top of mind. Last year, we hosted an event where we discussed our product road map in detail and plan to do 1 again late this year. We'll give you a much more detailed overview of what's getting built then. Before I hand it off to Michael, one more comment on growth. For quite some time, we've expected consolidation to begin in this space. Our exciting mission, market leadership and a strong cash position make Affirm an exit of choice for teams with great talent now that the prices and the parlance of our times have corrected a bit. We have no specific M&A targets to report today, but are keeping a very keen eye on the market. We continue to see strong demand for the simple idea of paying overtime and, in particular, for our take on it, supporting many transaction types and sizes and keeping away from gimmicks and hidden fees. Our strategy remains exactly the same as before, to continue building our network, more partners, more active consumers and more transaction volume. As always, I want to thank the ever-growing worldwide band of Affirmers united by our shared sense of mission and to send a special shout-out to the veterans, still going strong through the shared ups and downs of our first decade together. It's amazing to contemplate that just a few years ago we imagined that supporting $50 million of transactional volume would be quite the achievement, even as we now plan our march to $50 billion of GMV just a few years from now. And now on to Michael for the numbers. Thanks for the question, and I\u2019ll start and Michael can help quantify it. So probably the most important headline is that we are in full control. You should start seeing what we mean by that relatively quickly. One good metric or [indiscernible] anecdote to offer, so we have been taking a fairly conservative posture, as you\u2019ve probably heard on the call, or in the prerecorded part of the call, we have been keeping an extremely careful eye on the credit performance. All the while, our approval rates have actually gone up. So what we\u2019ve been doing in the background, and not a lot of, it sounds like we\u2019ve opened up significantly. I think the three points of incredible approvals have been added. What that means though is that we\u2019ve been optimizing credit very, very actively. This implies things like tightening in durations, asking for a more down payment, in some cases, asking for incremental income information. So yes, I don\u2019t think you should expect us to increase our provision. In fact, we intend to, if anything, be quite conservative. I know Michael want to quantify for us. So probably the most important thing to know about Amazon is that it\u2019s still very, very early relative to the potential of the \u2013 just the sheer scale they have and the many different ways for us to work together. We were very pleased with our Prime Day performance, frankly, as much technically and ability to approve and ability to scale all the thing from underwriting to the web systems. All that went really, really well and our partners have given us high marks on that front. We have a lot of work to do. You\u2019re right, that the 0% is always an extreme crowd-pleaser when it comes to consumer buying. And I think both of us in a partnership have noticed that it is, in fact, a very successful way of offering consumers a reason to buy now. And so we expect more of that. As it happens, we\u2019ll certainly report on it. But the current state of partnership is nothing but excellence. So first of all, we\u2019re launching a beta. And as we do everything here, it\u2019s a slow start, very careful optimization. We\u2019re not going to compromise our unit economics. We\u2019re not going to compromise any other metric that we care a lot about. The goal is, first and foremost, is to compel consumers to transact with Affirm more. I think when we took this company public, the conversation in the investor community and the analyst community was, well, you guys are great, but will people transact more than just 1.5 times a year or whatever the number was? We\u2019ve shown that we can continue to move that number up and up and up. One of the preference drivers is how rewarding are these transactions. And typically, that means miles or points or something like that. Of course, we\u2019ll put our own spin on it, and we are different and we like our differences. But it will be a way to give consumers one more reason to choose Affirm when they have all the choices. Rewards also tends to attract higher credit quality consumers. Just as a general statement, you will see that folks that need credit to improve their buying capacity don\u2019t care as much of our rewards. Folks that have lots of choices tend to select their paying instrument in part based on how rewarding it is. Therefore, consciously, and we\u2019re being very careful in the forecast here, with at least with that piece of mind, we don\u2019t expect to make these cost us more in unit economics. The goal is to keep the unit economics, but they are protecting we quite like our LTC rate and we\u2019ll keep targeting that. That hopefully makes it clear that these are predominantly merchant-funded. We\u2019ll launch with a handful of early merchant partners in just a little while from now, and we\u2019ll see how it goes and how well it drives incrementality to GMV. So the simple answer is we expect more GMV, hopefully, more transactions per active user should not expect deterioration in unit economics. That\u2019s a great question. The short answer is too early to tell. The reason we excluded the forecast is because that\u2019s literally what I\u2019ve been spending a lot of my personal time on. And I\u2019m not prepared to declare it to be ready to be given to everyone. We have 14 million active users that are very excited about this product. It\u2019s clear that they\u2019re transacting a lot more. If you drill down in that, you\u2019ll see the metrics that there\u2019s quite a lot of pay now transactions. Those obviously have a very different revenue profile. There\u2019s not a lot of risk in there at all. And that\u2019s obviously a natural drag on probably less transaction cost, if you start to think of it that way. On the flip side, we see quite a lot more loan volume, which is great, and we\u2019re excited about the incremental usage that we get in the credit that we provide there. Again, our goals are very clear. We very much like our unit economics. We intend to protect them. We are not going to compromise them. The risk associated with these transactions is new to us. We\u2019re still optimizing exactly, for example, what sort of insufficient funds rate we\u2019ll see as the transactions flow through to checking accounts? That\u2019s why we haven\u2019t pushed it all the way through to the general population. It is available but we have really not promoted very hard. So I think I\u2019ve given just enough data before\u2026 We\u2019ll give away a little bit of the secret sauce, and hopefully, it does not help my competitors too much. So one really interesting -- actually, to answer the -- probably the more kind of relevant part of the question, we\u2019ve been anticipating some form of stress since as early as January. So we have been keeping our eyes very, very open and have been optimizing credit and credit performance all throughout the calendar year. So this is not a new thing at all. The, call it, April and May is when we started taking a harder look at things just on a sort of \u2013 it\u2019s basically spending more time on the analytics. So I think the overall behavior of our credit and risk teams has really not changed in the last, what, our months were in nine. But just the level of intensity we\u2019ve been applying to the research side of it has increased and increased and increased. And the more we look, the more we find, and we have been finding pockets of interesting things that we care to correct before they metastasize to something greater. So one anecdote that I was going to share is there\u2019s a really interesting -- as much as Michael just pointed out, growing a straight line from DQ 30 into the ultimate charge-off is a bad idea, in my opinion, because there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to cure, there\u2019s a lot of tools we have. There\u2019s everything from loan modifications to collection strategies. That said, when you look at early delinquencies and how the flow rates change is a really good predictor of at least one kind of behavior. Consumers who basically say, look, I\u2019m kind of short right now, but I\u2019ll make good on it a little bit later than I was supposed to. And that\u2019s enough of a canary in a coal mine where if you look at it everywhere, you probably won\u2019t nice it because most consumers are still just fine. But if you look in the pocket, you might expect that sort of thing, you can start spotting these sort of things. And at scale, it typically means job losses. We\u2019re obviously not there yet, and hopefully, it won\u2019t get too far. But before that, that\u2019s actually a reflection of consumer sentiment about their potential for job loss, which is a second-order metric but we care a lot of those. Great question. So thematically, the way I\u2019ve been thinking about overall strategy for this fiscal year and the strategy set a little bit earlier than in the year. So we think about it for a while but this is the year we\u2019re going to execute on it. This is really the year of the consumer. Last year, we were lucky, proud, successful enough to bring on over half of e-commerce volumes onto the platform. We launched to general availability on a whole bunch of platforms and having able to scale with them. And it\u2019s showing up in the network effects. You see transaction usage growing, transaction per consumers. It\u2019s also the year, we brought on a whole lot of new consumers so the denominator has grown and the numerator outpaced it. And so it\u2019s all goodness in terms of bringing on new users on to the network. And this year, we\u2019re really going to invest in just making this the very best product for the end consumer in every imaginable way. And I\u2019ll definitely spend lots of time on talking about this at our product road map event sometime towards the end of the calendar year. But just if you scan the things that we bragged about in the -- in my recorded section, rewards, I think, is going to really move the needle not just in terms of consumer satisfaction but also will make it a very compelling promotional platform for merchants. And we expect to find good monetization there. Brand-sponsored promotions is something that we\u2019ve proven to work almost manually, if you will, in some of our largest big-box partners. We\u2019re really going to put it on a conveyor belt by creating a self-service console for that and integrating in a bunch of places. We have, obviously, Debit+ is something that I am personally very passionate about. I have fantastic customer stories. Now, when I say customer here I mean consumer, but I literally had to chat with a person who went to Colombia, the country on vacation with a \u2013 exactly one card in as wallet Debit+. And in the early beta, it did not work internationally. So we had to scramble a solution for him. But it\u2019s something that I really think is just a fantastic way of increasing transactions. Obviously, 2.7 [ph] transactions per week is a massive, massive opportunity to create more value for consumers. Every one of these transactions is two sided. There\u2019s always a merchant on the other side, and they are excited about the incremental conversion, incremental volume that we\u2019re bringing on. Frankly, there are huge opportunities in demand discovery and demand generation, which we\u2019re just scratching the surface if you go into the Affirm app, you\u2019ll find we\u2019ve made a lot of really interesting improvements in item level search. There\u2019s some really clever promotions around specific items. One really good metric north of 50% of our own and operated service originated transactions basically Affirm Anywhere. And now Debit+ transactions begin in a search box, which is kind of an interesting stats that should tell you opportunities there to monetize are pretty enormous. There\u2019s a small company in Mountain View, that\u2019s figured out how to make money on capture consumer demand from search. So we have lots of really, really exciting things planned for the consumer for this year. And I hope to brag about them on the next call, but I\u2019ll stop now because I\u2019m taking up your time because Michael\u2019s gotten so many really good questions, but yes, we have a lot planned on the consumer side for sure. And every one of these things is an opportunity to increase our margins. I think on at least the unit basis, we\u2019re seeing more competitors, if not exit the market, then fall away in terms of their competitive position. I think the \u2013 if you look at the North American footprint, I would argue we\u2019ve established our dominance over the last fiscal year, quite decisively. Presumably, you\u2019re talking about my baby number one relative to the current baby. PayPal entering the business generally did not have an impact that we could discern in our ability to close merchants or our ability to convince consumers that we have a great product. I think the audience that PayPal serves is a little bit like me, kind of an aging Gen X are a couple of kids and a dog and Affirm serves predominantly Gen Z and Millennials audience, and the two are quite different. And it\u2019s good that there are products available to everyone and we\u2019re excited to overall see the shift from credit cards and cash to buy now, pay later. So for the moment, because the segment is so under penetrated, we\u2019re not really feeling any competitive pressures. I\u2019m sure eventually it\u2019ll come to an end, but for the moment we\u2019re still single digit of U.S. e-commerce. And my point of view, the single most exciting thing, not single, there\u2019s a lot of exciting things is actually unfair. But one of the most exciting things that we\u2019re seeing right now is Debit+ being 50/50 online/offline, there\u2019s just a complete Greenfield of offline transactions that no one\u2019s really figured out. And we think we have something really special there. I\u2019ll start and Michael has a kind of it's sort of a different. So short answer is no, we are seeing if anything increase demand on the consumer side, which is exactly as we expected it primarily because inflation takes away spending capacity and you borrow to increase it. So I think in terms of need more credit that has been pointing north as inflation became more and more of a thing. We do see secondary effects of inflation. Some folks choose not to buy because the prices relative to their earning capacity are higher. And so they are thinking longer, they are buying a little bit less, but I don\u2019t think that impacts buy now, pay later if anything, that accretes to buy now, pay later in other forms of credit too. In terms of shift to shorter and longer term, that\u2019s a really, really good and important question. There\u2019s a lot of that, that we control in the sense that the consumer sees at least three, sometimes four different term lengths that we offer for every transaction, depending on what the consumer looks for. And we\u2019ve now gotten quite good with it, have to check out optimizing for the right collection of offerings that consumer can decide quite differently. Folks that are buying something that is pretty short term or sorry, pretty low AOV tend to select short term because those transactions we can generally speaking do on no interest at all. And so it really is a free loan, and it\u2019s pretty great if you can get it because just for use of money. It flips pretty dramatically when you are looking at an item that is factually outside of your personal cash position or personal cash flow, it then becomes a matter of monthly cash flow impact. And so at that point, consumers tend to choose the longest term possible because that lowers their overall cash exposure on a monthly basis that obviously increases our risk, increases the number of opportunities that consumer has to go delinquent or default. And as a result, we manage our risk by being judicious about just how long we\u2019re willing to take this term out to for a transaction. So we have as much to say about these terms as the consumer does, if not more, but there\u2019s definitely some differentiated behavior. The one thing that I can tell you we\u2019re quite right about 0% APR transactions are that much more exciting in an inflationary environment because borrowing money is becoming expensive things to the Fed and buying things is more expensive things to inflation. So if you can figure a transaction that has no interest at all, it\u2019s pretty great. I want to embarrass the person, but I got a fantastic piece of advice when I asked a friendly investor, how to think about M&A to ask yourself, would this be asset best off if it\u2019s owned by a firm? And obviously, there\u2019s some limit to sort of, we think we can manage anything, but there are definitely things that are very accretive to the business. If we can find something in the space or near the space that is better off owned by us and operated by us, I think we will take it very seriously now that the prices have normalized. And we do have a very clear road to profitability and have a \u2013 quite a significant cash position. Maybe slightly more technical way of thinking about what we\u2019re looking for. There\u2019s a bunch of really good ideas in this space, buy now, pay later is this really wide surface. I call it honest finance because I\u2019m an idealist. I think you can think of it as a non-revolving credit. There\u2019s 10 different ways of calling it, but this idea that it\u2019s too confusing to borrow money, and yet credit is really important, is it, you know is a simple idea, but it seems that its time has finally come. It\u2019s actually really, really hard to do. And the hard part comes from all sorts of things like underwriting is really, really difficult. We have a lot of exceedingly smart people like, I think I\u2019m surrounded by pretty clever people. And then I feel like I\u2019m more on every time I talk to a credit team because they\u2019re really, really smart and good at what they do. And it\u2019s hard to hire that team and it\u2019s really hard to scale it and it\u2019s hard to get it to be functioning. And so there are plenty of smart entrepreneurs with really good ideas that built a really cool mouse trap, but they\u2019re just not that good at underwriting and scale really allows you to hire even more of those people and train them on real data. And a decade of operating gives you a lot of really interesting use cases that you just wouldn\u2019t have seen if you\u2019re small. And so we\u2019re looking for businesses that had amazing entrepreneurs, amazing ideas, amazing first signs of traction that would really benefit from being put on a platform that has exceptional underwriting, exceptional capital markets reach at this point, very, very large user base, very large merchant base. So there\u2019s \u2013 we think lots of opportunity will be very judicious will be extremely good stewards of shareholder capital, not a thing we\u2019re going to execute imminently. But we\u2019re looking just because the market has now reduced some of the inflated violations. Thank you everybody for joining the call. We\u2019ll see you next quarter."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Thanks, Max, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by echoing Max and acknowledging all Affirmers for their contributions and dedication to our mission. We are proud of the progress we made this fiscal year as we introduced nearly 7 million more people to on a finance [ph], expanded and diversified our merchant base to cover more than 60% of U.S. ecommerce and delivered very strong unit economics at 4.3% revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of GMV, well above our long-term range of 3% to 4%. With our team's solid execution, we exceeded all of our guidance for fiscal 2022 despite increasingly volatile market conditions in the second half of the fiscal year. I'll cover three topics before we open the line for questions: first, a more detailed review of our fourth quarter results; second, an update on what we are seeing in terms of consumer credit performance; and third, some perspectives on what we expect and how we plan to operate in fiscal 2023, given the macro environment, the growth opportunities ahead of us and the profitability targets we plan to achieve. Now to the quarter. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons refer to our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 versus Q4 of fiscal 2021. Our Q4 earnings supplement is also posted on our IR website. We continue to scale our network. Active consumers increased 96% year-over-year to 14 million and active merchants increased to nearly 235,000. This help to drive 139% growth in transactions, 85% of which came from repeat consumers. As you have heard us say before, driving greater frequency is a key priority as it not only fuels our flywheel but helps us drive efficiencies. Annual transactions per user increased for the fourth consecutive quarter to three transactions per year, which was up 31% year-over-year. We grew GMV 77% and 89%, excluding Peloton. Our strong traction across our enterprise partnerships continued throughout the quarter with our three largest partners making up roughly 30% of our total Q4 volume. Our volume with our two largest partners grew 27% sequentially from Q3 and are still in the beginning stages of their integration. On Slide 9 of the supplement, you can see just how diversified our network is across industries. This represents a key area of strength and resilience for Affirm, particularly as consumers shift spending patterns like they did in Q4. That said, given how underpenetrated we are today, our growth is not limited by the growth of our merchants or even broadly to e-commerce. For example, e-commerce penetration retreated to its pre-COVID trend line this quarter, and our growth still outpaced the broader market by an order of magnitude. Travel and ticketing increased to $545 million, up 87% from last year and a staggering 443% compared to pre-pandemic levels of Q4 in 2019, highlighting the success of our investments in partnerships in the category. American Airlines, Expedia, Priceline and Vrbo were all top 10 merchants for Affirm this quarter. General merchandise grew to over $881 million, 477% above last year, driven by our deepening relationships with Amazon, Walmart, Target, also top 10 merchants for Affirm in fiscal Q4. PayBright more than doubled, posting year-over-year GMV growth of 116%. PayBright bright continues to hold a market leadership position in Canada that includes merchant relationships with Apple, Samsung and Hudson's Bay Company. Turning to the financials. Total net revenue grew 39% to $364.1 million, above our outlook of $345 million to $355 million and grew 49%, excluding Peloton. Network revenue grew 39% and interest income increased 33%. Gain on sale increased 30%. Revenue as a percentage of GMV contracted by 226 basis points to 8.3%, driven by a mix shift away from longer-duration 0% loans and towards short-term Split Pay loans. Split Pay GMV grew over 193% year-on-year and accounted for roughly 23% of GMV in the fourth quarter compared to 14% last year, as you can see on Slide 8 of our earnings supplement. Split Pay has a different economic profile compared to our core 0% APR program, and the composition of these two products effectively reversed year-over-year as we have expanded into higher frequency transactions. This resulted in a year-over-year decline in revenue take rates, which we express as a percentage of GMV. However, you can see on Slide 14 that take rates within each of our product offerings continue to remain relatively stable. Our strong top line growth, combined with the leverage we achieved on nonprovision transaction costs, drove a 25% increase in revenue less transaction costs to $184.3 million or 4.2% of GMV. Total transaction costs of $179.8 million grew 58% year-over-year. Excluding provision expense, transaction costs grew 21% compared to revenue growth of 39%. Loss on loan purchase commitments declined 21%, primarily driven by the mix shift I just mentioned. As a reminder, loss on loan purchase commitment mainly occurs with the core long-term 0% APR loans. Our funding costs increased 24% year-over-year, in line with the 24% growth in loans held for investment despite the higher rate environment and significantly below the 53% growth in our total platform portfolio. On our February call, we estimated that a 100 basis point rate increase beyond the forward curve at the time would result in an approximate 10 to 20 basis point impact to RLTC as a percentage of GMV for the second half of fiscal 2022 based on our mix at the time. Since February, peak rate expectations within the forward curve increased by more than 150 basis points. Despite this, we delivered 4.4% RLTC as a percentage of GMV for the second half of fiscal 2022, well above our implied 3.9% in our outlook at the time. We have the ability to manage the short-term impacts in the forward curve with the tools inherent in our product, which Max shared moments ago, and staggered renewal periods on our funding facilities. We continue to estimate that a 100 basis point rate increase beyond the current forward curve may translate to an approximate 10 to 20 basis point impact to RLTC as a percentage of GMV in fiscal 2023. In comparison to a more normalized fiscal third quarter of 2022, provision for credit losses grew just 10%, and provision expense as a percentage of GMV declined by 4 basis points sequentially to 1.65%. Our allowance for losses as a percentage of loans held for investment declined for the third consecutive quarter to 6.2% as we continued to drive strong credit performance. Excluding transaction costs, non-GAAP operating expense grew 60% to $215.2 million or 59% of total revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expense declined 1% year-over-year. Adjusted operating loss was $29.3 million in the quarter or 8% of revenue, which was significantly better than our outlook for adjusted operating loss of 15% to 11% in the period, driven by better-than-expected RLTC and lower-than-expected operating expenses. GAAP total operating expenses, excluding transaction costs, grew by 76% to $461.6 million, driven by year-over-year growth in enterprise warrant and share-based expense of $102.7 million. GAAP operating loss was $277.2 million, which compares to a loss of $114.3 million in the prior year period. Now to move on to my second topic, consumer credit performance. We believe we managed this to a great outcome despite the environment. As we have shared in the past, we are, first and foremost, focused on managing risk. We constantly monitor the credit performance of our portfolio as well as the broader environment. Given inflationary pressures, we began to see the signs of stress during the quarter within certain low credit segment consumers. This stress without mitigation would flow through to charge-offs. However, the inherent advantages of our underwriting every application at the transaction level and the high turnover nature of our book provides natural agility. Accordingly, we ever so subtly turned our dials and gave up a couple of points of growth this past quarter through small optimizations, and we still grew GMV by 77%. When we say we have the ability to manage credit outcomes, this is exactly what we mean. Our delinquency levels are healthy for our business, and we have demonstrated our ability to grow while controlling them. We've said it before and we'll say it again. We are different from our competitors who had to dramatically slow their growth rates because this is the only lever they have for managing risk. We are confident that these differences will only become more apparent over time. With that, let me turn now to our outlook for fiscal 2023. When we reported our fiscal 2021 results a year ago, we had just posted $8.3 billion in GMV. We closed fiscal 2022 well ahead of our plan at nearly $15.5 billion in GMV, representing 87% growth in GMV and 114%, excluding Peloton. Our team's outperformance this year means we are ahead of where we expected to be in terms of market share. We believe that we are well positioned to continue growing our network while expanding our product offerings and geographic reach. That said, we think it is important to acknowledge the current macroeconomic backdrop as we give our initial guidance for fiscal 2023 and attempt to estimate these factors through June of next year. While we cannot precisely predict the macroeconomic conditions, our outlook assumes the current forward interest rate curve. It also assumes that the current macroeconomic conditions do not fundamentally change for the better, with early signs of consumer stress persisting through the fiscal year. If we do see signs of significantly more stress or if rates were to increase much more than expected, we expect to utilize the various levers at our disposal to protect our unit economics. Among others, these include merchant and consumer pricing, duration shortening, approval rate changes and downpayment rates. Our outlook is also informed by the following: first, we made significant progress within our Shopify and Amazon programs, which reached general availability in June and November of 2021, respectively. As we enter the second year of availability for each of these programs, we expect continued growth in fiscal 2023 albeit from a much bigger base. Similar to fiscal 2022, we expect holiday-driven seasonal GMV strength in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. However, we are forecasting the second quarter to be the low point for the year-over-year GMV growth, given the nearly 370% growth in general merchandise GMV that we are comping against. Further, given timing within the quarter and the product mix, we expect to see a seasonal decline in both revenue and revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV in the period due to how revenue is earned on these loans, similar to last year. While we continue to make progress with Debit+, we are still in the early innings. As such, our outlook for fiscal year 2023 does not include any material GMV or revenue impact from this product. While the funding markets remain volatile, we enjoy a strong position without any current concerns on funding our growth. We would expect to continue to execute across all of our funding strategies and keep equity capital required below 5% of total platform portfolio. At that level, this would reflect marginally less ABS execution proportionately this year. With that context in mind, for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, we expect gross merchandise volume to increase between 32% and 42% from fiscal year 2022 to between $20.5 billion to $22 billion. This would imply a 2-year compound annual growth rate of between 57% and 63% versus fiscal 2021. Accordingly, we expect revenue of $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 20% to 28% and a two-year compound annual growth rate of between 37% and 41%. The forecasted contraction in total revenue as a percentage of GMV in fiscal 2023 is partially driven by our aforementioned interest rate expectations and the continued mix shift to expand into higher frequency purchases. Turning to expenses. We expect transaction costs of $865 million to $915 million, reflecting a modest year-over-year reduction in transaction costs as a percentage of GMV. This improvement is expected to be driven primarily with the loss on loan purchase commitment line. As a result, we expect revenue less transaction costs of $760 million to $810 million. Revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV is expected to be roughly 3.7%, in line with our long-term model of 3% to 4% GMV. Moving down the P&L. While we will be prudent with expenses to be reflective of the current environment, we will continue to invest in engineering and product talent to support the robust product road map that has been and will continue to be a key differentiator for Affirm. We expect our sales and marketing and G&A expense lines to grow on a dollar basis in the year. However, these lines should demonstrate operating leverage as a percentage of revenue when measured on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Accordingly, we expect adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 6.5% to 4.5% for the full year. As we shared in our May earnings call, we expect to achieve a sustained profitability run rate on an adjusted operating income basis by the end of this fiscal year. As we said previously, we do not expect to compromise our long-term growth opportunities as we progress towards sustained profitability. Finally, we expect weighted average shares of approximately 298 million for the year. For our first quarter ending September 30, 2022, we expect GMV to grow 55% to 62% to $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. We expect that growth to drive total revenue of $345 million to $365 million. Our outlook for the first quarter also contemplates transaction costs of $176 million to $188 million; revenue less transaction cost of $169 million to $177 million; adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 12% to 10%; and weighted average shares outstanding of 292 million. While the uncertain macro picture over the next 10 months to 11 months as well as us lapping some staggering year-over-year comps are leading us to be prudent in the short-term, we remain very bullish about our opportunities. We are confident in our ability to execute and we continue to see strong underlying trends that position Affirm for further growth and success. With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator? No. Just look, I think what you\u2019re seeing very recently in terms of the sequential build is what we consider to be a pretty normal seasonal pattern. That seasonal pattern should begin to abate and go down. As you know, there\u2019s two things to think about. There\u2019s the numerator and the denominator. The one thing to keep in mind is that, obviously, is the base that you divide it by, both in terms of the impact that we have on total term lengths as well as what we have, just in terms of the actual change in the total portfolio. We\u2019ll change the measure that we report publicly, but when we look at the business and think about the state of credit, we feel very optimistic that we have it well in hand. And the ultimate proof is how that shows up in our confidence around our margins in the business, which we continue to believe are quite strong and on the higher end of our long-term range that we\u2019ve given everybody. Yes. I think one of maybe the most important thing to think about is the seasonality that we would expect around both the revenue and transaction costs. Q2 is going to see, we think, a valley, both in terms of the growth rate of the business, the revenue take rates and the revenue less transaction cost. And that has a lot more to do with the timing and type of loans that we originated, much like it did last year. In the back half of the year, we would \u2013 truly, the back half of the year, we would not expect any material changes with respect to the efficiency, except we actually would assume it improves on a margin basis from Q2 onward. Yes. The answer that we\u2019ve been giving folks up until this quarter is that we saw \"no signs of stress\" and that was something that was the first quarter we saw any signs. I think what you saw, though, in the quarter was all of our tools to manage that on full display. The reality is we dissolved the stress and we began to have to react to it. So I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re making a statement about things into the future beyond that. What we saw today is extremely manageable. And that\u2019s just not the case for other lenders out there right now. In these credit segments, we\u2019re trying to differentiate us is that we actually have the levers to control it and we did. And we continue to feel very good about being able to do that into the future. The statement around macro environment really should be heard as uncertainty. I would politely tell anybody who thinks they can predict where the economy is going to be in 10 months or 11 months, and I think that gives us reason to be prudent in how we operate the business, given the lead that we\u2019ve built, where we have the ability to be very careful and thoughtful about how we run the business. And it doesn\u2019t show up in, as Max said, doesn\u2019t show up enough throttling approval rate substantially. It shows up maybe in the timing and type of products that we want to launch and being careful about introducing a lot of net new because we don\u2019t feel like we need to right now. We can be very careful and thoughtful about the state of the consumer and play with the lead that we have right now. Yes. So let me start with the second question first. Our allowance that we have on the balance sheet, which determines the provision and the income statement is that for the third quarter declined. So we have \u2013 I can\u2019t find any other words to describe how comfortable we are with the current state of credit other than we provided for a full expectation of credit losses at the time of origination, and that outlook has been improving for the third consecutive quarter. So we feel very strong about the state of the portfolio. The delinquency data that we show publicly is the portion of the total platform portfolio that\u2019s 30 days delinquent or more. And as I was probably mumbling through a little bit earlier, there\u2019s a numerator and denominator effect there. And it\u2019s a little bit difficult for us to want to be prescriptive on where that number needs to be. Obviously, we have a guardrail. We\u2019re way away from the guardrail. The guardrail, as we talked about earlier this year, is many points above anything that we\u2019ve ever operated the business at. The real thing we would like to do is make sure that the unit economics or revenue less transaction costs are still printing at really high levels with the provisions that we are \u2013 we would need to be taking. And those are the numbers that we feel really, really strong about. And on top of all that, we are hitting the seasonal peak for delinquencies and therefore would expect the seasonality trend to work into our favor from here. Yes. Thank you for the question. So first, just overall, the way to think about the market, we have really strong demand or supply for \u2013 on balance sheet where health capacity, I would characterize, it as us having to say no and the banks are plenty willing to lend money right now. I think the forward flow market also remains very attractive with a robust pipeline of forward flow buyers who are interested in partnering with us. I think the ABS market is obviously quite volatile, and you\u2019re going to see us be a little bit more careful and thoughtful about where and when we execute there this year. However, with respect to forward flow, that capital is very committed. And we have about $200 million out of $4.3 billion of forward flow capacity that\u2019s even up for renewal in the entire fiscal year. That is to say, 95% of our capacity is mostly locked into the entirety of fiscal 2023 on the forward flow side. What that does for us is it serves as one of the many tools that we have to mitigate any impact of rates. So the ways that could impact us are, first and foremost, access to credit. We enjoy a large amount of capacity where it will not constrain growth. And the second way it impacts us is obviously in higher cost of funds or lower yields that we\u2019re able to get when we sell loans. In both those cases, those impacts are delayed. What you saw in the back half of fiscal 2022 was a huge shock in rates. When we talked in February until the end of the year, peak rates moved to the head of my note, over 150 bps. And the impact to us was frankly impossible for anybody to see as we crushed our revenue less transaction cost numbers in that period. So we look at next year as being a very secure and safe level of funding, with the upside being our team is still out executing deals because the markets are still very constructive on the forward flow side. I think the one thing that you\u2019re going to see less of this year, though, is ABS execution with the big caveat being that we just don\u2019t know. I mean, if the market does find a new stable footing, you\u2019ll see us be active in the back half of the year. But as we sit here today, we do think that there\u2019s a lot more volatility in that market. We\u2019re going to be \u2013 and that\u2019s showing you up how we\u2019re talking about the funding mix for the next year. Yes. So the first question, in terms of Peloton, we\u2019re very proud that we\u2019ve expanded our merchant and category mix where Peloton continues to deconcentrate in our business. It was low-single digits percent of our business in Q4, for example, and yet, we still haven\u2019t lapped all of the contribution. So we would continue to expect that to be a declining business. Our current expectations are that it\u2019s something on the order of 4 points of GMV growth and 7 to 8 points of revenue growth that we are not getting this year or at least that we expect all come to drag against. And that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re so confident in the long-term here is that we do have to grow out of this a little bit of a drag associated with a partner who\u2019s trying to write a troubled ship. The second question was how much concerns are we having? Look, our guide is our guide. We are not going to caveat it or characterize it in any way, except it\u2019s our guidance. However, we do take it very seriously. We like to put numbers out there that we can achieve. You\u2019ll notice that the ranges are wider this year. The width of the range reflects the fact that we do have a lot more factors at play that we can\u2019t control. But our guide is the guide and yet we take it very seriously, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve missed one yet. Yes. So maybe a little bit of a brief description of how the allowance and provisioning works mechanically. So at the time of origination, we make an estimate of the likelihood, the likely allowance needed for that loan. And then every month, we update what we would consider to be the back book\u2019s drift or improvement. And so for example, we might estimate a loan or pooled loans will have a 5% total loss content to origination. And a month later, depending upon actual repayment information or the flow rates from one delinquency bucket to the other, we update that view. And it is the case that we\u2019re outperforming our own expectations. And just generally speaking are we like to try to be pretty thoughtful in ensuring that we\u2019re never under provided for potential losses. That\u2019s still the right side of the ledger to be on \u2013 sorry, we\u2019re concerned. And I think that\u2019s a factor that\u2019s probably very difficult for you to read through. And it\u2019s why we keep pointing people back to look at our current allowance rate, and that is our current estimate of all of the future losses of the loans better than our balance sheet. I think that drawing a straight line between data like the DQ 30 chart to eventual charge-offs is a pretty big step and probably not something that I would do. I would look to the current allowance rate as the total losses for the book that\u2019s on the balance sheet and then think about that number as being increasing or decreasing, consistent with the future expectation of losses. Yes. So I think the \u2013 let me speak to what happened in the prior quarter first because I think that\u2019s pretty illustrative of what we think will happen. We might look at a particular merchant or a set of consumers or products. We\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019re able to be very surgical. And we\u2019ll find a pocket of risk that, say, is currently experiencing signs of stress. The leverage then that we have at our disposal or everything from actually just increasing the credit bar to lower approval rates because you have less of the capacity to approve to changing the term lengths, if you change from a 24 months to 18 months, your risk posture changes or requiring more down payments. Max mentioned this at the very top. We made all of those moves to manage the early signs of stress. Those are signs of stress, I think you\u2019ve seen reported in a lot of other contexts. We were able to fully mitigate those and still be very growthful and actually increased our approval rates. And that\u2019s because approval rate, yes or no, isn\u2019t the only lever that we have. We have a lot more tools at our disposal. And we could be very growthful, because we were still launching and scaling these very large platform relationships like with Amazon and Shopify. And so these \u2013 I would characterize them as truly like we\u2019re talking about low single-digit percentages of GMV on a net basis, because while we\u2019re doing those tightenings, we\u2019re also doing optimizations that open up and find opportunities to underwrite really good risk. If you think about how that informs the plan going forward, I think it\u2019s maybe a tertiary factor. I don\u2019t even think of it as a primary factor. And it\u2019s definitely true that we have a more conservative posture today than we did a year ago. But the impact of lapping the explosive growth in the first half of last fiscal year and the aforementioned Peloton categorical headwind, combined with the things like the shift in e-commerce and the discretionary spend, those probably matter more than the things that we\u2019re seeing directly on credit as we sit here today. The truth is, as we said in the call, as we see deterioration, we will pull extra levers, they may not show up as substantially less growth, but they will, nonetheless, show up with protecting our unit economics. Yes. Peloton and, in general, the mix shift towards lower take rate products. And if you think about $1 of low-teens MDR, high -- long-term 0% being swapped in for $1 of 4% to 5% Split Pay-type MDRs, you\u2019re giving up a lot on a GMV basis in terms of total revenue. Now some of that\u2019s offset by the strong revenue profile of our interest-bearing product, although there\u2019s obviously a timing element to that as well. But the biggest driver is just the growth in our low AOV business, which has a lower revenue take rate. Yes. And the thing I would -- maybe to put it in context, the revenue models for the Debit+ product will be unregulated today \u2013 unregulated debit interchange, which obviously you\u2019re not making 3% to 4% when your gross is down there. And then interest-bearing, I\u2019ll just note that some of our strongest and most profitable programs are direct-to-consumer interest-bearing products. We feel really good about that side of the house. And obviously, you\u2019ll see some lower total growth and net take rates, revenue take rates and RLTC take rates on the pay now or debit transactions that happen on the card. We\u2019ve not given any guidance because as Max said, it\u2019s a bit too early, but you would expect it to be lower. That being said, our direct-to-consumer product is much higher than that. And so we haven\u2019t given guidance and not going to today, but we feel really good about where we\u2019re getting to once we are at scale. Yes. If you\u2019re referring to the churn we have in our earnings supplement that\u2019s titled Delinquency Performance, that\u2019s total portfolio excluding Split Pay. We exclude that because there\u2019s a bunch of goofy stuff that happens with the denominator. And that\u2019s a target we\u2019ve been chatting through today, but that takes a look at the total platform portfolio. And we manage credit and look at credit metrics. We never distinguish between on and off except for when we go to the financial statements. The actual credit measures are always on portfolio-wise. And there, you can see the trend we were talking about earlier where you saw the seasonal growth. It\u2019s a pretty normal thing to see sequential increases going to late summer months as you have seasonally low period coming off of the tax season. And so that\u2019s what it looks like overall. Again, I think we feel very strong about where credit sits today. We feel very good about our ability to manage the small levels of stress that we have seen and are very optimistic and confident in our ability to do so through the rest of the fiscal year. Yes. Just to recap again, I do think we would expect our sporting good nature of business to show some headwind. It was the only category that declined last quarter. We would continue to expect that to be a drag. We estimate that single partner to be 4% June be a headwind alone. The second thing I\u2019d say is in Q2 of last year, we launched to general availability with Amazon. And we also went GA in late Q1, early Q2 for Shopify. And as you start to lap those, you are going to see, for the category that they\u2019re over indexed in, some compression. So for example, general merchandise will have lower growth rates. However, it\u2019s from a very, very, very high growth rate base because the base gets bigger but the dollars of growth are still very impressive there. And just for a second, to be really clear on what it\u2019s not, the guidance for GMV is not reflective of the view that we have around consumer demand for our product. We\u2019re still seeing healthy application levels. As I mentioned before, our approval rates are actually up, so both the demand and our ability to underwrite. It\u2019s also not a function of any shift away from or falling out of favor of the category. We continue to see our payment method as being more important to merchants than it was in a prior period. And lastly, it\u2019s not a function of capital constraints. And so our outlook really is about the one or two pieces of acute headwind. And then we\u2019re lapping some really gotti [ph] numbers. We feel really good about the underlying absolute value of the business and feel really good about our path to continue to build a really big network at scale. Yes. So you have our guide for Q1 and then what you\u2019ll expect to see in Q2 is originations spiking, lots of originations later in the quarter. And when that happens, it\u2019s just the way things flow through the P&L is that you end up with lower revenue and RLTC rates in the quarter. And then the back half of the year, you kind of realize some of the benefit of originations that happened earlier in the year. And we just had the same trend to play out, albeit slightly more muted because, again, I think the explosive growth that we had in Q2 won\u2019t be repeated but the shape should look very similarly. And so you have our guide for Q1. Think about Q2 as being lower on a vertical basis, although again, we feel really good about the economic content that we\u2019ll be originating in that quarter such that the back half of the year will be improving from there. Yes. The only thing to add to that, if you look at the transaction counts, it\u2019s a really good measure for what\u2019s going on our consumers wanting to use this product more, because so many of the other things are functions of puts and takes on merchant relationships, product types and everything else. But the actual transaction count growth is huge. Transactions last quarter 139%, but the biggest piece of growth in the business is hitting more transactions in the platform. And yes, we\u2019re proud that 85% came from repeat users, but the total gross number of transactions is a really good measure of just how much there. And it\u2019s sequentially up a lot too. It wasn\u2019t just up year-over-year. We were up sequentially from Q3 quite a bit and across a really wide set of categories. This past quarter saw our travel ticketing business really dominate the \u2013 I think with people a little over 12% of GMV that quarter and that just shows you that this is not a single use product. They\u2019re not for us anyway. It\u2019s not about beauty or t-shirts on Shopify. It\u2019s about everything that they\u2019re buying and you saw that last quarter."

Active merchants grew by more than 16-fold year-over-year. Active consumers grew by 137% year-over-year, with greater frequency and engagement. Our total transactions increased by 162% year-over-year. Highlighting the trust we are building with consumers, 81% of all transactions were from repeat Affirm users. This is the highest repeat rate that we have ever reported. We accomplished this while another 1.5 million consumers joined our movement to replace confusing outdated financial products with new honest ones. Our GMV was up to $3.9 billion, growing 73% year-over-year and almost doubling, excluding Peloton. Total revenue was $355 million, a 54% increase year-over-year. In revenue less transaction costs, a key measure of our unit economics was $182 million or 4.7% of GMV. We continue to grow with our existing partners and add new ones. Just a couple of operating highlights since the beginning of Q3. The travel and ticketing segment has been outperforming expectations and volume more than doubled year-over-year. Our long-term partners, Expedia, Vrbo and Priceline were all in the top 10 by volume in Q3. The quarter also marked the general availability of Affirm on American Airlines and the launch of our very first Canadian travel merchant. We are excited to continue growing our network of relationships in this segment. Affirm continues to be the strategic partner of choice for enterprises and platforms. Adding to existing collaborations with Verifone and Adient, we partnered with Fiserv and Global Payments to make signing and launching new merchants frictionless. We are also excited to announce a new agreement with Stripe, unlocking streamlined distribution of Affirm\u2019s honest financial products to millions of merchants. Since the launch of our partnership with Shopify just a year ago, we have seen significant uptake of Split Pay, our biweekly paying for product. We have expanded our agreement with Shopify to bring Affirm\u2019s monthly offering to the platform. We plan to start rolling out adaptive checkout and simple interest-bearing installments by the end of our \u201822 fiscal year. As part of this expansion, I am also pleased to report that we have extended our exclusive relationship with Shopify, lots more details in the press release that we have just filed. This marks our fifth straight beat quarter and proud we are of all of them. That said we operate Affirm with a longer horizon in mind. Our goals are to deliver value for our customers and improve the lives of consumers and ultimately, in doing so, generate cash flow to reinvest in our business and create value for our shareholders. As you will see in Michael\u2019s report, we have already delivered profits on an adjusted operating income basis and this quarter makes it three out of the last five. You will see in our guide that we still expect to invest in the next quarter, but let me make something very clear. Our plan is to achieve a sustained profitability run-rate on an adjusted basis by the end of the next fiscal year. That is to say, we expect to generate revenue that consistently exceeds our adjusted operating expense starting July 1, 2023. We do not expect our plan for reaching profitability to compromise growth just as we demonstrated this quarter. We also do not plan to raise any new equity capital, because we believe Affirm is fully funded to profitability. We will share our full fiscal year \u201823 outlook and full year guidance in our next earnings report. But to say a little more here. We do not see network and revenue growth and margin as quantities in conflict with each other. Indeed, our growth, combined with strong unit economics, is what propels us towards profitability. Consumer demand for our products is significant and we only expect it to increase and the value we create for our customers goes directly to their bottom line. Meanwhile, the market penetration in the U.S. is still in the low single-digits. And at the growth scale we have already achieved, the increasing rate of repeat transactions at 81% today affords us several advantages, most importantly, economies of scale and fixed and transactional cost, meaningful underwriting improvements and opportunities to deliver new products to our consumers and merchant partners at a very low marginal cost. This is why the bookings of this quarter\u2019s results are so important. We nearly doubled our network volume ex-Peloton, while managing our unit economics to 4.7% of GMV. This is well ahead of our long-term model of 3% to 4%. We grow our network GMV responsibly and deliberately with unit economics always firmly in mind. This is especially so because as a vertically integrated network, we manage the risk embedded in our transactions. We covered our approach to credit underwriting in the past, but I\u2019d still like to speak briefly about our credit risk management. Every time you want to use Affirm to buy something, you have to apply to be approved for that specific transaction. We make it easy and convenient for you to apply, but we will still look at the state of your finances at that very moment, including, among other things, your recent credit usage and then decide. If we believe you won\u2019t be able to pay off your loan, we will in fact decline your application with compassion and transparency without fail. As a reminder, we do not charge late fees or revolving. In other words, we have a structural incentive to decline a transaction that we believe to be a bad financial decision for you, because approving it is guaranteed to be a bad financial decision for us. And at our scale of transactions over $10 million last quarter alone, the dials we get to turn to control credit risk are highly fine grade. Another key structural advantage is the very short weighted average life of our loans, which is about 5 months. As the economic cycle changes, the loans we made in the past will have a rapidly diminishing impact on Affirm\u2019s future financial performance. Given our structural incentives to engage in responsible lending, deep commitment to strong network unit economics and a high degree of control over risk, we strongly believe we are well-positioned for success in a downturn. During the very brief recession of 2020, we saw applications nearly quadruple at many of our merchants. We believe paying over time without late fees and gotchas will be in greater demand during a downturn. It is our mission to improve people\u2019s lives and we will be prepared to meet this demand. But again, our approach is only to extend credit that we believe can and will be repaid. The multibillion-dollar business we have today is the result of years of trial and error, ideation and execution. One of the many attractive properties of operating a network at scale is that it can be very cost effective to deliver new products and services to a large active audience. Not all of our new offerings will result in our next $1 billion revenue line, but we are committed to finding the ones that do. Last September, we shared some of our product plans with you. We have continued to execute on this roadmap. So, let me briefly run through some of which shipped in Q3. Throughout the quarter, we delivered several iterations of the Affirm Super App, the single platform for the growing family of Affirm consumer offerings. Each such iteration delivered results, improving user engagement by about 3% and adding over 1% to our in-app transaction volume. These numbers may seem trivially small in comparison to some of our headline growth metrics, but obsessing over user experience that compounds and we have many more iterations planned. We also rolled out a Chrome browser extension, a convenient way to pay with Affirm at online stores, where we are not yet directly integrated using a single use Visa card while shopping in your desktop browser. We brought Adaptive Checkout to many new transactional services, including our own Affirm Anywhere product, Chrome browser extension, and as I mentioned, it will be available on Shopify. We also added Bitcoin interest to the popular Affirm savings account, a super simple way for our savings account holders to hold cryptocurrency by choosing to receive their savings yield in Bitcoin. Debit Plus. By now, I suspect some of you might actually have the Debit Plus app and the companion card that comes with it. So, you have already seen what\u2019s the first version can do? You can split lower value transactions into four payments after the swipe and use the automatic pre-approval button to plan larger transactions and feel confident in your spending power. There are many more features coming over the summer and beyond, most importantly, longer term and interest-bearing loans and Affirm Rewards, but the B1 of Debit Plus is here and ready. We know this because even with this minimalist version, we are seeing an order of magnitude higher engagement among Debit Plus users as compared to non-Debit Plus Affirm users, an average of more than two transactions per week and the Debit Plus experience will continue to improve as we release regular updates to our growing user base. We are inviting tens of thousands of users per day to get their cards and expect to exhaust our now sizable waiting list. We appreciate your patience and open Debit Plus to all eligible Affirm users in fiscal Q4. Eligible here means a certain level of usage history and good standing with Affirm. It is super early and I am still neck-deep in UX optimizations, but I am truly thrilled to begin what we think will be the era of Debit Plus, the simplicity of debit and a flexibility to pay at your own pace with no late or hidden fees. Affirm continues to succeed because of our exceptional team. I have said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, it is a privilege to lead this company, and I would like to thank all Affirmers from marking another waypoint in our journey and to thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support. As you can see, we remain focused on what ultimately matters, results. Now, over to Michael to review those in detail.\nMichael Linford: Thanks, Max and good afternoon everyone. Our Q3 results and really our performance over the last several quarters demonstrate our ability to deliver impressive growth and attractive unit economics despite a volatile market environment. Once again, we outperformed our outlook for both growth and profitability and our unit economics were strong. We continue to grow both sides of our network. Active consumers increased 137% year-over-year, while active merchants increased to nearly 210,000. Total transactions grew 162% year-over-year and more than 80% from repeat users. Transactions per user, our key frequency metric, increased 19% year-over-year or more than doubling our active user base. And along with that growth, we achieved profitability on a non-GAAP basis, delivering $4 million in adjusted operating income. We grew GMV 73% and nearly doubled GMV when excluding Peloton. Our revenue increased by 54% and our measure of unit economics, revenue less transaction costs, reached 4.7% of GMV. This was a particularly strong result and well above our long-term targeted range of 3% to 4% of GMV. Our outperformance was driven by strong revenue growth, excellent capital markets execution, and better than expected credit performance. While the provision for credit losses increased year-over-year, as a reminder, last year\u2019s provision was net negative given the release of excess COVID-related loan allowance. We also continue to drive greater capital efficiency gains across our funding program as equity capital we used to fund our loans decreased to 2.4% of our platform portfolio versus 4.9% last year. With the strong growth of our business and continued momentum, we are raising our outlook for fiscal year \u201822, which I will discuss more in a moment. Before I do that, let me walk you through our third quarter results in greater detail. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons refer to our third fiscal quarter of \u201822 versus Q3 of fiscal \u201821. We had another great quarter for consumer growth. Active consumers increased 137% to $12.7 million and increased nearly $1.5 million sequentially from fiscal Q2. This growth helped drive 10.5 million transactions in the quarter, a 162% year-over-year increase. Despite adding users at this aggressive pace, we also saw frequency increase as transactions per active consumer grew to 2.7%, up 19% year-over-year. In the third quarter, active merchants grew to nearly 210,000 from this 11,500 last year, thanks to the continued scaling of our partnership with Shopify. On a sequential basis, active merchants, which we calculate over a trailing 12-month timeframe, grew by 39,000 or 23% from the December ending quarter. Turning to GMV. We grew GMV 73% to $3.9 billion in our third quarter, a $1.7 billion increase from last year. As a testament to the increasing depth and breadth of our network, no single merchant accounted for more than 10% of either revenue or GMV for both the 3 and 9 months ending March 31. This demonstrates the continued diversification of our business, which we believe is a key area of strength and resilience for Affirm. Shifting to GMV by vertical. Travel and ticketing increased to $390 million, up 122% from last year, topping last quarter\u2019s high mark. With the recent easing of mass mandates and travel restrictions, we see extraordinary demand to book travel now and pay over time with Affirm. We also remain enthusiastic about consumer demand for live events. General merchandise grew to over $670 million, 448% above last year, driven by our deepening relationships with the world\u2019s largest retailers, which also increases the seasonality of our business. We saw roughly a $200 million sequential decline in GMV within the category, which was in line with our expectations given the seasonally strong holiday shopping season in the December quarter. Sporting goods and outdoors declined to $425 million, down 21% from last year or 20% sequentially from fiscal Q2, driven by a roughly 40% decline in Peloton offset by growth with other connected fitness merchants. PayBright, which we acquired on January 1, 2021, nearly triple GMV, posting annual growth of 198%. We are excited about our prospects and the success we are driving in Canada as well as other expansion opportunities currently on our roadmap. Now turning to the financials. Total net revenue grew 54% to $355 million, well above our outlook of at least $335 million. Network revenue grew 29%, while interest income increased 42% and gain on loan sale increased 221%. Revenue as a percentage of GMV contracted 116 basis points to 9.1%, driven by product mix away from longer duration 0% loans and towards short-term split pay loans. Split Pay GMV grew over 215% year-on-year and accounted for roughly 20% of GMV in the third quarter compared to just over 10% last year. In our earnings supplement posted to our website, you will see that merchant revenue take rates have remained relatively constant for each of our offerings despite our hyper growth. Our strong top line growth and the leverage we achieved on non-provision transaction costs drove a 37% increase in revenue less transaction costs to $182 million or 4.7% at GMV, well above our 3% to 4% long-term target. Total transaction cost of $172 million grew 78% year-over-year compared to revenue growth of 54%. Excluding provision for credit losses, which was negative in the prior year period, transaction cost as a percentage of GMV declined 1.6 points to 2.7%. shift away from longer duration 0% APR loans, loss on loan purchase commitments declined 24%, while improvements in our capital programs helped limit the growth in funding costs to just 8%. Funding costs were an area of considerable leverage in the quarter declining to 0.4% of GMV, down from 0.6% in the prior year period. Provision for credit losses grew from negative $1 million a year ago to $66 million as a year ago figure included a significant release of excess COVID-related loan allowance, while this year\u2019s figure reflects the intentional normalization of credit that we\u2019ve discussed over the past several quarters. Credit performance was better than expected across all credit segments. As small optimizations across our Split Pay and large enterprise programs yielded very favorable outcomes, this led to lower allowance rates on new originations across a large percentage of our GMV. Allowance for losses as a percentage of loans held for investment declined for the second consecutive quarter to 6.4%. The outperformance in revenue less transaction costs and greater operating leverage allowed us to drive better-than-expected adjusted operating income in the period. Our non-GAAP technology and data analytics expense reflects lower-than-expected personnel costs. Affirm has a robust pipeline that calls for more talented engineers than we have the ability to hire in the period. However, we were able to partially address this need from technical talent in early Q4 with the hiring of over 100 engineers for Affirm, primarily from fast in early April. We also continue building our brand through sales and marketing investments, but the majority of these expenses were non-cash in nature. Excluding these non-cash expenses that are fully outlined in our GAAP reconciliation tables posted on our IR website, our sales and marketing expense decreased by $1.7 million or 5% year-over-year, which represents an annual decrease of 5 points as a percentage of revenue. Excluding transaction costs, non-GAAP operating expense grew by $48.9 million or 38%. Adjusted operating income was $4 million in the quarter or 1.1% of revenue, which was significantly above our outlook. GAAP total operating expenses, excluding transaction costs, grew by $66 million or 19%, driven by $102 million increase in warrant expense, partially offset by an $80 million reduction in stock-based compensation. GAAP operating loss was $227 million, which compares to a loss of $209 million last year. The $227 million operating loss number includes $217 million of equity-related costs stemming from our previously granted enterprise partners and stock-based compensation. Before I move to our rate outlook, I\u2019d like to discuss our funding program. We fund the business to optimize for stable, consistent access to deep and diverse pools of capital. We ended the quarter with nearly $9 billion in funding capacity across our three main channels: warehouse lines, forward flow agreements with whole loan buyers and ABS securitizations. 53% of the capacity is off balance sheet, and all of our bilateral relationships are fully committed and generally in multiyear agreements - with only 31% of this capacity maturing in the next 12 months. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we have brought on $2.5 billion in new funding capacity from new and existing capital partners. In addition to that $2.5 billion, subsequent to the quarter end, we closed our $500 million 2022 A revolving ABS transaction. And last week, we also added a new multiyear $500 million forward flow partnership with a large Midwest-based insurance company. We expect to continue to add capital through both scheduled commitment increases from existing partners and onboarding new partners. Our capital program is structured to be resilient, flexible and generate increased velocity as we scale. Let me quickly recap each of our channels. Our warehouse lines are on balance sheet facilities with spreads ranging from 1.65% to 4%, and we were able to advance up to nearly 90% against the loans we pledged. These bankruptcy remote facilities are non-recourse to our parent company and generally used to fund shorter duration collateral. They also serve as a loan aggregation mechanism for our ABS securitization program. We generally maintain these facilities at low utilization rates. This stood at 37% at the end of the quarter, providing us significant excess capacity. Our forward flow program represented close to half of the overall capacity across a range of diverse partners and provides highly efficient off-balance sheet funding. These programs allow us to earn most revenue upfront and additional revenue over time via servicing income. Further, loans sold to third parties via the forward flow program do not require an allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet or any related provision expense on the income statement. Finally, in terms of our ABS securitization program, we have closed 9 securitization transactions that represent roughly $8 billion of volume since launching the program in mid-2020. Our deals have performed really well, and we just achieved our first AAA rating as part of our most recent transaction. Just as we have attracted many leading e-commerce merchants and platforms to Affirm, we have also attracted a diverse set of blue-chip investors to our capital program. This is a real competitive advantage for Affirm. We believe our scale and asset quality will ensure that this advantage continues into the future. Affirm is strongly positioned to continue to drive outsized growth in the ABS market, which is highly liquid with over $1.5 trillion outstanding across all asset classes. Now, let me share some color on our outlook, which you can see on Slide 26 of our earnings supplement. We expect the progress we\u2019ve made thus far in fiscal year \u201822 to continue to drive strong growth in our fourth quarter. Consistent with the public guidance issued earlier this week, we expect the trends observed in Peloton GMV in fiscal Q3 to continue through Q4. We now expect our Split Pay offering to contribute at least 20% of fiscal year \u201822 GMV, with the largest contributor of this volume coming from Shop Pay installments. We expect a sequential increase in total operating expenses outside of transaction costs, driven by the recent hiring of the engineering team from fast in April and marketing campaigns currently planned in the latter half of the quarter. As always, our outlook assumes the current forward interest rate curve. Finally, our outlook does not assume a material impact from the rollout of Debit Plus. For our fourth quarter ending June 30, 2022, we expect GMV of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, revenue of $345 million to $355 million, transaction cost of $185 million to $190 million, revenue less transaction cost of $160 million to $165 million, adjusted operating margin of negative 15% to negative 11% and a weighted average share count of $290 million. For our fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, we now expect GMV of $15.04 billion to $15.14 billion, revenue of $1.33 billion to $1.34 billion, transaction costs of $692 million to $697 million, revenue less transaction cost of $638 million to $643 million, adjusted operating margin of negative 7.6% to negative 6.6% and a weighted average share count of approximately $283 million. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Max for some closing remarks.\nMax Levchin: Before we open for Q&A, I thought it would be helpful to quickly recap the state of play and our plans for Affirm. First, we are laser-focused on scaling the network, increasing our consumer reach and frequency, going deeper with our existing partners and adding new ones. Our opportunities remain fast with significant underpenetrated markets to reach. Second, we will continue investing in our technology, people and brand and doing so is disciplined. We have roughly $3 billion in dry powder, and we firmly believe that we are among the most efficient allocators of capital in the industry. Third, as I already mentioned, with excellent unit economics, consistent focus on risk management and a diversified capital access strategy, our plan is to achieve a sustained profitability run rate on an adjusted basis by the end of the next fiscal year. And finally, at our core, we are builders, excited by the prospect of solving problems and improving lives. We will leverage our scale and reach to introduce brand-new concepts to our merchants and consumers, like Debit Plus, as we continuously expand our product and revenue lines. While the macro environment is uncertain at Affirm, the picture has never been clearer. We are a category leader with massive growth and rapidly expanding market opportunities as the secular trend towards honest, transparent financial products continues. Affirm is in an enviable position given the depth and breadth of our partner network and our unwavering commitment to financial responsibility. As the category begins to go mainstream, the opportunities we can capture are only expanding. We have an incredible team and an inspiring mission. We will continue to scale, drive attractive unit economics and deliver on our mission to improve lives and focus on results. We will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. And I think that the \u2013 Max, the comments that you made about the success with respect to \u2013 with respect to the large merchants and the impact that that\u2019s had. Maybe you could kind of expand on that? Because obviously, you\u2019ve got things that are going on that would potentially be able to add others. And yet, you\u2019ve also got things like what you mentioned with respect to the Chrome browser that could allow for situations where Affirm is not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have a kind of dedicated relationship with the merchant. And so I guess as we look out over the next several years, how should we think about the biggest areas for growth for the company?\nMax Levchin: So the \u2013 about building a network. First of all, thank you for the question, sorry who\u2019ve been listening to us on stuff for a while. So great question. So the thing about building a network is you have to continuously balance the consumer side and the merchant side. So if we are signing on more and more consumers, we are implicitly adding more places where they might want to go shopping. So it\u2019s essential for us to continue launching direct-to-consumer payment products. Because if someone says, hey, I\u2019m a big fan of brand X and I came from a store in Peloton, where I\u2019m not likely to repeat over and over, we have to offer them coverage. Otherwise, they will turn the active consumer. And so the browser extension and the app, which has a marketplace feature in it and the card itself, all things we\u2019re building consumer sites were all fundamentally about retaining consumers and meeting them where they want to go where they want to shop. And so that will continue happening and we see that as both an engagement driver and a revenue driver. Obviously, the products are a little bit different, where we don\u2019t have a direct integration with the merchant. But it does not, in any way, reduce our commitment and just attention to innovation on the merchant side. We have a whole bunch of stuff. I purposely kept my remarks a little bit shorter this time around, but there\u2019s a long list of things that we shipped that have to do with merchants. And I really did not give any credit to those teams just because I wanted to keep it quick. But we\u2019re continuously rolling out really interesting stuff like the active checkout is a really good example of \u2013 it\u2019s just a very, very fundamental piece of tech that we put together. It is the future of the industry. Consumers do not need to go through many different funnels. They just need to pick the right product for them, better yet, we should be there, helping them pick the right product. That\u2019s what I have to check on us. It literally figures out what is the best way of paying for something. So that will continue happening. And part of why we need to continue hiring engineers, you only maintain strong unit economics, if you\u2019re able to offer something that no one else can sell. Competition on price sucks if you have a commodity that everybody else has. If you\u2019re building stuff that no one else got, you can actually sell it at a good price and not worry about someone hiring you.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. And as a follow-up question, Michael. One of the questions that we get most often from investors is in the face of a rising rate environments, obviously, you have some products where the consumer is the primary one that\u2019s been charged and the other that\u2019s merchants charged to the merchant, particularly the 0% category. Could you talk a little bit about your plans as to how to kind of manage the rising interest rate environment for each of those products? And maybe what you\u2019ve also done to date, if anything?\nMichael Linford: Yes. We really haven\u2019t had to take any action to date. If you look at the merchant fee rate slide in our supplement, you\u2019ll see, again, relatively constant merchant fees. We view that as a real market of success in the face of pretty heavy competition, we\u2019re able to maintain and even grow in some cases, the merchant side. And of course, as we talk a lot about on the APR side and the consumer side. Those rates are strong enough to allow us to deliver really compelling unit economics. And that\u2019s the lens through which we look at this question. And it is true that as rates go up, there is pressure on the funding side of our business. But it is a mistake to think about that as a flow-through on a linear basis. We have many different funding channels with staggered maturities and very different structures. And as I mentioned, for example, we just onboarded a new fourth flow partner who\u2019s an insurance company has a very different view of rates and how they think about that versus, say, access to quality assets over time. That allows us to manage it in the nearer term. I think in the very long run, so going out more than a year, you would expect us to need to start to take action, but that\u2019s more of a long-term thing than anything we deal with tactically in the near term.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks, so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nDan Perlin: Good evening. And lots of good stuff here. I wanted to just touch on \u2013 and I suspect you\u2019re going to kind of shed lightly in a little bit, but I wanted to touch on this path to profitability on an adjusted operating income basis. My question is when you think about it or when you kind of laid this plan out, how much of this is really a function of some of the scale-driven benefits that you\u2019ve been able to accrue over the past several years versus really management\u2019s desire to kind of reach profitability sooner? And then the second piece of that is, is there anything in the macro environment that\u2019s compelling you to want to pull that forward? Or is this really in line with your long-term plan that we may or may not have been really aware of? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: Good question. So first of all, the most important thing to take away is that it really is the scale that\u2019s allowing us to get there. I mean if you look back a few quarters, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re sort of flirting with profitability without ever seeing it out lapped. I think it was a useful and intelligent thing to do to tell the market, hey, we know exactly when it\u2019s going to happen. Here\u2019s a date. But it\u2019s not the same thing as saying, we got to get there fast. So let\u2019s pull some tricks and doing natural things, not at all. And so in that sense, it really is the function. The difficult thing was to build a product that commands a price and maintains a good margin and to be disciplined about credit. You can grow faster if you just approve everyone and some of our competitors do that. And it\u2019s a lot easier, but you then have to deal with bad losses. We are not okay with bad losses or losses that we can control. And so those are all things that we\u2019ve always done, and that\u2019s the scale advantage that we have today is the variable revenue or adjusted. I\u2019m going to trip up on my accounting terms, Michael will correct me later. But at a certain scale, your fixed costs get overwhelmed by our variable revenue is basically what\u2019s happening here. So yes, the statement about profitability is fundamentally about telling the market. We\u2019ve always had a plan. We know where we\u2019re going. Here\u2019s the save of dates. We\u2019ll continue to invest. We are not doing unnatural things to get there.\nDan Perlin: Yes. No, that\u2019s fantastic. Just a quick follow-up on the engagement here again, very impressive you said 2.7% in the current quarter. Last quarter it was 2.5%. So that\u2019s all happening at the time you\u2019ve got this massive active customer increase. The question I have here is, are you finding that in that repeat usage, the 81% versus kind of 75% last quarter, are the consumers using the same product again as they come in at a Split Pay user and they\u2019re always a Split Pay user? Or are they finding that within that 81%, there\u2019s some diversification and they may even mature into other products? And are you able to not steer them but incentivize them, I guess, or maybe educate them into other options that may even be better for them? Thank you.\nMax Levchin: It\u2019s a great question. There\u2019s definitely a lot more to unpack there than I suspect the time allows. Here\u2019s just like bullet points that are sort of easy to rattle off. So the probability of repeating at the same store is, generally speaking, highest for a majority of stores. There are some unique stores where you\u2019re just not going to come back because you already have a fragment. But vast majority of time, especially for some of the largest partnerships, it is highly likely that you will repeat at the store where you came from. Two, there is definitely propensity to repeat on the same product initially. But as each cohort matures and we have more opportunities to teach them what else Affirm can do for them, it widens. Three, there\u2019s a fundamental difference between the behavior of people that have our app and the ones that don\u2019t, like that is just a profoundly different behavioral pattern, and I could write a small science paper on that one. But once you\u2019re using the app, you\u2019re basically starting to think of Affirm as a replacement for your purchasing device. Let\u2019s use that \u2013 let\u2019s see what else can I say very quickly. The last thing that\u2019s worth knowing \u2013 so I\u2019d have to check out, which I sort of bragged about a little bit earlier is basically \u2013 you can think of it as a router for financial tools. We have sort of unpacked the credit card. The idea of like hey, just like your card, we\u2019ll figure it out later, it actually recover interface, it\u2019s terrible for you as they are a financial position, personally, but it\u2019s a really, really nice user interface. And the big thing that we have to accomplish here was to continue offering you but we kind of have to guide you to a good decision because they\u2019re \u2013 already we have a lot of choices and you are used to be no choice at all credit card. So that to checkout is that idea. It\u2019s just where you say, hey, here\u2019s three choices. This one is no interest at all. This one is a little bit longer term, but has some interest, etcetera. As we deploy that across more and more services, you will see more product cross-pollination and we\u2019re right in the middle of just pushing that very, very hard. Like literally, I\u2019m watching the first numbers coming in from some of the deployments outside of our own products. And probably next quarter, we\u2019ll start talking about what that cross pollination really looks like.\nDan Perlin: That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Thanks very much. Thanks for all the details to day, guys. I wanted to ask about on your credit performance, you said it had been a little bit better than you thought, Michael. And can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re managing that right now, especially with the changing environment? Are you being more restrictive at different points? Or are you finding that, that isn\u2019t necessary yet? Just wondering how you\u2019re \u2013 just wondering if you can give a little color in terms of how you\u2019re managing the credit applications and going out of credit right now?\nMax Levchin: I\u2019ll start, and Michael will probably give a more precise answer. So we always manage it exactly the same way, like we have not at all changed our approach. We look at both vertical and horizontal slices. We asked the question, how is this in American Society is doing, Canadian, Australian., How are the overall in terms of their job security and sort of the policy set sort of this horizontal slice? And then vertically, we asked the question how is this \u2013 how are the sales in this version category? We know what folks are selling. We know if it\u2019s selling better or worse, which means that the advertising campaigns that drive consumer demand can reach audiences that are potentially overextended already and maybe shouldn\u2019t be borrowing. So, all of that feeds into the policy setting. And then we tune it, but we tend it all the time. It\u2019s not a thing that we sort of get together and say, all right, it\u2019s been a quarter, let\u2019s talk about it. Like we talk about it literally every Monday morning. There is a triage conversation about credits with our head of risk in the room with the executive team and we review all of our numbers. And say, hey, how do we feel about the American consumer at the highest level? And then we dive deep into here\u2019s this product, it\u2019s old split, how is it doing on Shopify? And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s performing a little bit better typically means that the precautionary steps we took were slightly less necessary than we expected \u2013 at least 1 or 2 degrees to the right or to the left. It\u2019s a number \u2013 let\u2019s put a hand break and we over tighten or something like that. We really do not run it like a banquet. And it was very, very. Michael probably have better numerical answers.\nMichael Linford: No. I think the other thing, guys, is we look at the unit economics in the business whether you measure that to the financial statements like we do in the revenue less transaction costs or you look at on a horizontal basis, and we make sure that there\u2019s enough economic content, and we make sure that we make credit decisions consistent with that. The things we\u2019re always looking at is based upon prior originations, how are they trending against the forecasted numbers. And given the very short duration of our asset, we\u2019re able to get that signal very quickly to feed it back into decisioning. And if you just look at where we\u2019re at right now, we did better on the revenue less transaction cost line in large part because we performed better. This is a bit of a counter signal to what you\u2019re seeing in a lot of other companies right now, and we attribute that mostly to the fact that we\u2019re pretty careful on the front end, and we\u2019re very diligent about managing it as Max alluded to.\nJames Faucette: Got it. I appreciate that. And then when we look at you\u2019re adding additional capital partners and commitments, etcetera. How are you feeling about where you\u2019re positioned now with kind of those commitments versus your growth targets? Is there a lot of cushion there? I know you haven\u2019t given guidance for next year. But obviously, I would assume that those carry into next year, etcetera. So just wondering if you can give a little bit of nuance and color of where you\u2019re at versus where you want to be on both capital commitment and how that relates to your growth ambitions generally?\nMichael Linford: Yes. I think the easiest way is we feel really, really good. We ended the quarter with $9 billion of capacity. We actually have over $10.1 billion as we sit here today, additional capital that we talked about on the call, the 22A deal and the ABS market as well as the onboarding of the new flow partner. Both of those two are just, we think, massive endorsement of the product. I think it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a good time to remind everybody that there is widespread support for the asset we generate in the capital markets. And we have not seen that be a real difficulty. We have seen the overall macro market change. So that changes rates, it changes spread. But the asset underneath it, the asset we create continues to be something that all of our capital partners, both understand and value and even the rating agent sees value, as I talked about, the AAA rating on the senior tranche in our last ABS deal. That suggests we\u2019re producing really quality assets and it\u2019s linked back to the credit question. So if we keep our eye on the ball, and produce good assets like we have been and will continue to do, we feel really good about it. We\u2019re not giving guidance like you said, for fiscal \u201823, but we feel very good about where we stand. If anything, I think you\u2019re going to see us continue to be slightly larger on capacity or lower in utilization because of the macro concerns, even though we actually don\u2019t have those as a management team.\nJames Faucette: Alright. Thanks for that input, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. You may proceed with you question.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks for the call, guys. So yes, just a couple of things. Maybe I\u2019ll come back to the sustained profitability messaging. Just wondering if you can quantify that at all? I\u2019m just thinking back to the Analyst Day last year, when I think you guys had said that adjusted operating margin would get to the 0% to 10% range. Once revenue growth had slowed to 20% to 30%, GMV to 30% to 40%. So is that the right way to think about where you may exit fiscal \u201823? Just wondering how we should view that in light of the Analyst Day? Or do you feel like this is a little bit of a kind of updated messaging just given how much the macro environment has changed?\nMichael Linford: Yes. Thanks for the question, and I appreciate the way you were it. This is definitely, as we say, in and this does not replace our prior nor is it meant to suggest that we think growth will slow. Quite the opposite, as Max talked about. And to be really clear, we do not think that the decisions will take in order to get us to that breakeven or better adjusted operating income will result in any sort of slowdown in growth period. In fact, the growth will allow us to achieve it and the focus on unit economics will get us there inevitably. So don\u2019t \u2013 please don\u2019t read into us suggesting that the growth rates will slow. Quite the opposite, we feel very good about the growth into next year. While we\u2019re not giving any guidance today, I think there are a few trends that are worth highlighting. The first is that, remember, we were experiencing the full year for both Shopify and Amazon. And that\u2019s just the full year with those deals, but the full year with expanded product rollouts, we talked about the expansion on Shopify to new products, including adaptive checkout, but also all the optimizations that Max talks so often about whether it\u2019s the sum of a lot of little things that we\u2019re doing with these large partners. That\u2019s going to be a key avenue for growth for us. And as always, we talk about that plus is the thing that will continue to be very incremental to any of the current run rate in the business. And so we feel really good about growth in the next year. We\u2019re not giving any guidance, but please don\u2019t hear our profitability target as any indication that we expect to slow down quite the opposite.\nJason Kupferberg: Very helpful. And then just on gross profit on rev less transaction expense. You\u2019re going to exit this year, I mean, based on your Q4 guide, just at or maybe a hair above the top end of the 3% to 4% longer-term range. And I know we\u2019ll have to wait until next quarter to get kind of a full complement of guidance. But is there any reason to believe sitting here today that you won\u2019t be able to comfortably stay in that range next fiscal year?\nMichael Linford: Absolutely not. We feel very strong about our ability to deliver that in any market environment, and we\u2019ll continue to use that as the range talked about in the business. This quarter saw us pretty materially above that range. And again, I would characterize that as being a little bit warmer than we want it to be, 3%, 4% is a very good range for us. This is the 5th straight time we\u2019ve hit our commitments and we would expect to continue to do that, and we\u2019re committed to do 3% to 4%.\nJason Kupferberg: Good to hear. Thanks for the comments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-up on Jason\u2019s last question. In terms of the timing of the ramp of the Shopify expansion and also of the Stripe deal. Will that \u2013 should we think of that as just hitting 2023 rather than having an impact later this year? And in addition, how long is the shop renewal for? I think I saw in the press release multiyear. I\u2019m not sure if you can tell us exactly how long it was for?\nMichael Linford: Yes. Last question first, it\u2019s all the way through June of 2025. The timing \u2013 we are in the midst of rolling out additional products Shopify right now, as Max mentioned. It\u2019s uncertain if it will have any material impact in the next 6 weeks of the quarter, but feel good about it. I think that and the Stripe deal are much bigger going into fiscal \u201823. And then Max maybe you can provide some color on the Stripe deal?\nMax Levchin: Stripe is super cool. Basically, one of the common delayed, if you will, when we sign a merchant to launch them the cost always, hey, how long it\u2019s going to be before we can go live and say, hey, we\u2019ve got to put $200 script to your checkout and on your product page and off you go. And then we have to integrate with your payment system and plum, if you will, the settlement and money transfer and everything. And if you have a deal with an existing payment provider for that merchant, EG, FIS or Global Payments or Adyen or Stripe, which is the latest one, you can literally replace that whole back-end integration with, yes, we\u2019ll just route a firm transactions on the that has already been put in there by Stripe. And that\u2019s literally flipping a switch to an enormous number of merchants that have partnered with Stripe, it\u2019s really millions in their case. We also have a bunch of really interesting projects planned with them that probably be on the scope. Again, I would want you to not think of them as an immediately accretive thing, but it is a vast market opportunity that we\u2019re very, very excited. And as a longtime friend and fan of Stripe and full disclosure investor in the company, we\u2019re very happy with the partnership there.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. It sounds like a pretty...\nMax Levchin: All creating these avenues for more growth for many years forward, that\u2019s what this is all about.\nRamsey El-Assal: Perfect. A follow-up for me, sales and marketing expense was down quarter-over-quarter quite a bit. And I guess, first, how should we think about that line going forward in terms of where it might stand as a percentage of revenue. But in addition, as you ramp with the larger platforms and brands like Amazon, Shopify, etcetera, can you \u2013 will that have a positive impact on your marketing spend? Can you rely on their brand and their marketing spend effectively to kind of take some of the pressure off your P&L?\nMichael Linford: So, first, on a non-GAAP basis, you did see sales and marketing come down quite a bit sequentially and really even on a year-on-year basis. That is mostly due to the timing of some marketing campaigns that we run. We talk a lot about this, but our marketing activity isn\u2019t tied to in-quarter revenue or GMV generation. The kind of investments that we have been making over the past year have really been around building a brand and building awareness in the consumer, which has a less direct and less tied to in-quarter performance measure. And that\u2019s why you are able to see in this quarter, really strong growth despite pretty substantially less amount of sales and marketing on a non-GAAP basis. I think going forward, we are not prepared to give you any indication about the shape of the P&L or where we expect those lines to be. But obviously, as we work ourselves towards breakeven or better on adjusted operating income line, we would expect leverage across all of our fixed cost lines.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good afternoon, certainly appreciate you taking the question and appreciate the conviction Max as usual. Michael, we get a lot of questions about the fin side of the business, not as much the tech side of the business. And a couple of things stand out to me and I wanted to ask first about just the platform portfolio and funding mix, Slide 19. The fact that equity capital required is actually down to 2%. There was a lot of talk about a securitization that didn\u2019t get done intra-quarter, for example. Is that a sustainable level to me, that\u2019s super impressive, given \u2013 especially given all the concerns about liquidity that seem to be swirling around the market and around a firm in particular?\nMichael Linford: Yes. I appreciate the question. Yes. I think we have said that we would like to be below 5% on a sustainable basis and feel like that\u2019s a good range to be at. You will see an ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter based upon how much forward flow or one-time deals might happen in this last quarter saw a securitization happened early in the quarter, which I guess folks weren\u2019t really attending to that actually allowed us to move quite a bit or 0% paper off the balance sheet. And you can see that as the top bar on that chart, there you see on that slide. That will continue to be the way we want to operate. We want to be both durable and the quantum of capital that we have access to. We want to deliver the economics that we have signed up for and be very efficient with the shareholders\u2019 capital. We definitely never want to let growth be impacted by our capital program. So, we are always going to be overfunded with excess capacity, and you have seen us do that this past quarter and we will do that into the future while still delivering the strong units. So, I would say that it would be below 5%. I don\u2019t know that would stay in the 2% range sustainably. And again, I would just reiterate that I think our team is doing a very good job executing in these pretty volatile markets. And we are pretty proud of the access to capital that we enjoy right now because we generate a high-quality asset.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Yes. That\u2019s clear. I appreciate that. And then, Max, maybe a question, I know it\u2019s early on Affirm Debit Plus. But can you talk about any learnings or thoughts about inflows and the ability to drive direct deposit attach? And what you think the opportunity is for growth from more recurring spend on that product?\nMax Levchin: See, I promised myself and Michael that I will not jump out with a bunch of cool stats. And yet, as an engineer, I am prone to them. Here is a cool one. The number one most visited physical retail used by consumers right now is Walmart groceries, which I think it\u2019s probably true for a lot of America, but it\u2019s, to me, a super anecdotal, so just ignore it, if you will. But it tells you that a subset of consumers that we have given the card to have now used it to buy groceries, which I think that\u2019s probably the sort of fuzziest news I have heard about the product so far. In very, very baby product. It has on the current UX revs, how do need something and it\u2019s going to be in 1,000 before we are satisfied here. But the fact that people are using it to buy food is the best indicator I have heard like we want it to be top of wallet. We want it to be the thing that people take to go shopping for their family, to give them financial flexibility. I have a lot of miles and the commitment to this product to go. In terms of shareable statistics, it\u2019s growing at ridiculous rates right now, but it\u2019s also completely self stimulated in the sense that we are finally opening up to a bunch of users. So, of course, it\u2019s going to grow at crazy rates. At some point, it\u2019s going to even out and then we will know what the natural growth rate looks like. We will open it up to the entire Affirm base. Once the wait list is cleared out, you will just have a button in your Affirm app saying, \u201cHey, do you want your cared,\u201d so we need a little bit more time to scale.\nMichael Linford: And my team is alerting me that I misspoke earlier in Q3 was an interest-bearing not as your present in any event it got off sheet and priority execution. I wanted to make sure they got written so they don\u2019t get attacked.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Alright. Well, very cool. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. You may proceed with your question.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask my question. So, just really quick, can you give us a sense of sort of the interplay between the reserves and the charge-offs. Charge-offs of rising reserves are \u2013 seem to be coming down. Like how much of it is, Michael, like denominator/a difference \u2013 makes difference? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nMichael Linford: Yes. I mean the allowance is always the current estimate as a percentage of loans held for sale, the current estimate of future allowances. And so that 6.4% where we ended up, that\u2019s where we would expect it to be on a percentage basis. If you want more of a kind of backward-looking measure, that\u2019s where we show the delinquency performance and you see that\u2019s trending on, I guess, it\u2019s Slide 21 of the supplement, you can see where that\u2019s trending. Charge-offs are a bit difficult to get too much information out of given that we charge off at 120 days. So, it\u2019s pretty difficult to really get a sense of how credit performance is reflected through the charge offline. And again, the short duration of our asset mix that double true.\nDan Dolev: Got it. And just one last data point, if I may. I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but can you give us like some GPV estimates for Shopify and Amazon?\nMichael Linford: Yes. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t. No. But what we did say in the\u2026\nDan Dolev: No one is listening, okay?\nMichael Linford: Dan, you and I both do as not true. The thing we said in the call, the prepared remarks, which is true, is that no partner was more than 10% of GMV or revenue on a three-month and nine-month basis. So, you can get some sense there. We also showed you the general merchandise category, which is inclusive of some of the largest retailers in the world, grew to over $670 million. So, those are the stats we can share.\nDan Dolev: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Great quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. You may proceed with your question.\nRob Wildhack: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just as a percentage of funding debt, the funding costs in the quarter were quite a bit lower. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on there?\nMichael Linford: Yes. I think that reflects a number of factors, which is execution. Remember, the \u2013 we talked about it a lot, but rates moving does impact us, but not in the near-term. Most of our is locked in and committed. Very little of it is truly floating. And if you look at our warehouse that limits the amount of funding rate exposure that we have. And then just generally, we have a lot of very well-executed capital markets activity over the past 18 months that reflects in really strong performance.\nRob Wildhack: Got it. Thanks. And then bigger picture, I think the adaptive checkout seems to be a real linchpin of all the deals that you have announced recently, specifically from the enterprise partners. And Max, you talked about it a little bit, but anything to add on why that product kind of stands out as being particularly interesting to those partners?\nMax Levchin: Sure. A couple of different reasons, and we talked about this before, so I apologize if this is sort of old news. Vast majority of large enterprise partners that we have won picked us because we span the entire gamut of products possible. If you are just a split pay specialist, it\u2019s great. But if you sell both bicycles and bicycle tires, you will need two providers. And if you are picking a technology partner, and you want to scale, you want to be good at underwriting, you want them to have a good capital markets. You don\u2019t want to go out of business. We did all those criteria really well, but the one thing that we do have is we have excellent well-performing products that meet the price point as the consumer need. That doesn\u2019t \u2013 products is great, but you still may have to integrate those products multiple clients. I have to check out was this idea that what if we gave you just one single integration, and we will guide the consumer to the right financial choice for them so that the consumer satisfaction actually accretes to both us and the brand that we are literally helping the person live a healthier financial life. And so it\u2019s only resonated with our partners. It\u2019s certainly really resonated with us because it\u2019s extremely on mission. And it allows us to just continue driving savings in terms of paid interest to consumers and better conversion to the merchant. So, it\u2019s a it\u2019s almost a meta product. It\u2019s infrastructure for multiple products that we have built in the past to live together in harmony in a single page. And it has been really well received by the market. You are right in that set. And some merchants, by the way, are not really appropriate. If you only sell apparel within sort of a very tight $30 to $50 price range, you might not care about the ability to pay for things over 12 months. But if you are Walmart or an Amazon or many, many, many other merchants that sell multiple SKUs in a fairly wide range of price points that have to check out is the ideal product is you only integrated one, it has old same properties of Affirm and it self-changes to meet the consumer need on the spot without the version having to configure anything. By the way, also supports things like 0% deals or all is something we are famous for it that we have done so well with the last 10 years. It\u2019s all baked inside a set integration.\nRob Wildhack: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys. Just a couple of quick ones. I guess just thinking about the tightening of the credit market. Has your guys\u2019 transaction acceptance rate changed at all given kind of where we are in the market? And then secondly, when we look at delinquencies, is there a reason why it\u2019s excluding split pay now on the slide on 21, maybe I missed that piece? And then where do you expect delinquencies to track at these levels kind of through the fiscal year? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: The first part of the question, questions in front of me, sorry. So, the transaction approval rate has not changed very much at all. And again, like we really manage this at a merchant-to-merchant, basket of risk level to basket of risk. There is multiple different acceptance rates. And they are really, really quite different, like it\u2019s just really important to think of Affirm as a \u2013 if you need one number, it\u2019s a weighted average and the weights are quite dramatically different from bucket-to-bucket. That said, the weighted average right now is roughly the same. The reason for it isn\u2019t because there aren\u2019t people paying more or less of their bills. But because the application rates that we have, the number of people asking us for loan vastly exceed the ones that we are actually going to approve. And vastly a little strong, but the approval rates have remained pretty good and remain the same. The point there is our job is to rank risks. We have been quite good historically and intend to remain in the future, very, very good at rank ordering applicants that come through. We have approved the ones we believe can pay their bills. And then after that, we stop. The number of people that ask that can\u2019t pay their bills does not seem to be changing very much. And so the approval rates, therefore, have remained roughly or the acceptance rates have remained roughly the same. I will let Michael as my way through this one, I will let Michael take care of the other half.\nMichael Linford: Yes. So the DQ chart does not exclude Split Pay, the vast majority of our balances on total platform portfolio basis or no Split Pay. The Split Pay asset is a 50-day asset. We have $120 charge-off policy. So, as you can imagine, the way that actually works with respect to the delinquency calculation doesn\u2019t really make sense to look at on a Q3 basis. I think it\u2019s pretty misled to look at it that way. In terms of where it\u2019s going, we would expect to continue to track at or below the \u201819 levels on a portfolio basis based upon our current projections.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today\u2019s question-and-answer session. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob and thank you everyone for listening in. We delivered excellent results in fiscal Q3. Active merchants grew by more than 16-fold year-over-year. Active consumers grew by 137% year-over-year, with greater frequency and engagement. Our total transactions increased by 162% year-over-year. Highlighting the trust we are building with consumers, 81% of all transactions were from repeat Affirm users. This is the highest repeat rate that we have ever reported. We accomplished this while another 1.5 million consumers joined our movement to replace confusing outdated financial products with new honest ones. Our GMV was up to $3.9 billion, growing 73% year-over-year and almost doubling, excluding Peloton. Total revenue was $355 million, a 54% increase year-over-year. In revenue less transaction costs, a key measure of our unit economics was $182 million or 4.7% of GMV. We continue to grow with our existing partners and add new ones. Just a couple of operating highlights since the beginning of Q3. The travel and ticketing segment has been outperforming expectations and volume more than doubled year-over-year. Our long-term partners, Expedia, Vrbo and Priceline were all in the top 10 by volume in Q3. The quarter also marked the general availability of Affirm on American Airlines and the launch of our very first Canadian travel merchant. We are excited to continue growing our network of relationships in this segment. Affirm continues to be the strategic partner of choice for enterprises and platforms. Adding to existing collaborations with Verifone and Adient, we partnered with Fiserv and Global Payments to make signing and launching new merchants frictionless. We are also excited to announce a new agreement with Stripe, unlocking streamlined distribution of Affirm\u2019s honest financial products to millions of merchants. Since the launch of our partnership with Shopify just a year ago, we have seen significant uptake of Split Pay, our biweekly paying for product. We have expanded our agreement with Shopify to bring Affirm\u2019s monthly offering to the platform. We plan to start rolling out adaptive checkout and simple interest-bearing installments by the end of our \u201822 fiscal year. As part of this expansion, I am also pleased to report that we have extended our exclusive relationship with Shopify, lots more details in the press release that we have just filed. This marks our fifth straight beat quarter and proud we are of all of them. That said we operate Affirm with a longer horizon in mind. Our goals are to deliver value for our customers and improve the lives of consumers and ultimately, in doing so, generate cash flow to reinvest in our business and create value for our shareholders. As you will see in Michael\u2019s report, we have already delivered profits on an adjusted operating income basis and this quarter makes it three out of the last five. You will see in our guide that we still expect to invest in the next quarter, but let me make something very clear. Our plan is to achieve a sustained profitability run-rate on an adjusted basis by the end of the next fiscal year. That is to say, we expect to generate revenue that consistently exceeds our adjusted operating expense starting July 1, 2023. We do not expect our plan for reaching profitability to compromise growth just as we demonstrated this quarter. We also do not plan to raise any new equity capital, because we believe Affirm is fully funded to profitability. We will share our full fiscal year \u201823 outlook and full year guidance in our next earnings report. But to say a little more here. We do not see network and revenue growth and margin as quantities in conflict with each other. Indeed, our growth, combined with strong unit economics, is what propels us towards profitability. Consumer demand for our products is significant and we only expect it to increase and the value we create for our customers goes directly to their bottom line. Meanwhile, the market penetration in the U.S. is still in the low single-digits. And at the growth scale we have already achieved, the increasing rate of repeat transactions at 81% today affords us several advantages, most importantly, economies of scale and fixed and transactional cost, meaningful underwriting improvements and opportunities to deliver new products to our consumers and merchant partners at a very low marginal cost. This is why the bookings of this quarter\u2019s results are so important. We nearly doubled our network volume ex-Peloton, while managing our unit economics to 4.7% of GMV. This is well ahead of our long-term model of 3% to 4%. We grow our network GMV responsibly and deliberately with unit economics always firmly in mind. This is especially so because as a vertically integrated network, we manage the risk embedded in our transactions. We covered our approach to credit underwriting in the past, but I\u2019d still like to speak briefly about our credit risk management. Every time you want to use Affirm to buy something, you have to apply to be approved for that specific transaction. We make it easy and convenient for you to apply, but we will still look at the state of your finances at that very moment, including, among other things, your recent credit usage and then decide. If we believe you won\u2019t be able to pay off your loan, we will in fact decline your application with compassion and transparency without fail. As a reminder, we do not charge late fees or revolving. In other words, we have a structural incentive to decline a transaction that we believe to be a bad financial decision for you, because approving it is guaranteed to be a bad financial decision for us. And at our scale of transactions over $10 million last quarter alone, the dials we get to turn to control credit risk are highly fine grade. Another key structural advantage is the very short weighted average life of our loans, which is about 5 months. As the economic cycle changes, the loans we made in the past will have a rapidly diminishing impact on Affirm\u2019s future financial performance. Given our structural incentives to engage in responsible lending, deep commitment to strong network unit economics and a high degree of control over risk, we strongly believe we are well-positioned for success in a downturn. During the very brief recession of 2020, we saw applications nearly quadruple at many of our merchants. We believe paying over time without late fees and gotchas will be in greater demand during a downturn. It is our mission to improve people\u2019s lives and we will be prepared to meet this demand. But again, our approach is only to extend credit that we believe can and will be repaid. The multibillion-dollar business we have today is the result of years of trial and error, ideation and execution. One of the many attractive properties of operating a network at scale is that it can be very cost effective to deliver new products and services to a large active audience. Not all of our new offerings will result in our next $1 billion revenue line, but we are committed to finding the ones that do. Last September, we shared some of our product plans with you. We have continued to execute on this roadmap. So, let me briefly run through some of which shipped in Q3. Throughout the quarter, we delivered several iterations of the Affirm Super App, the single platform for the growing family of Affirm consumer offerings. Each such iteration delivered results, improving user engagement by about 3% and adding over 1% to our in-app transaction volume. These numbers may seem trivially small in comparison to some of our headline growth metrics, but obsessing over user experience that compounds and we have many more iterations planned. We also rolled out a Chrome browser extension, a convenient way to pay with Affirm at online stores, where we are not yet directly integrated using a single use Visa card while shopping in your desktop browser. We brought Adaptive Checkout to many new transactional services, including our own Affirm Anywhere product, Chrome browser extension, and as I mentioned, it will be available on Shopify. We also added Bitcoin interest to the popular Affirm savings account, a super simple way for our savings account holders to hold cryptocurrency by choosing to receive their savings yield in Bitcoin. Debit Plus. By now, I suspect some of you might actually have the Debit Plus app and the companion card that comes with it. So, you have already seen what\u2019s the first version can do? You can split lower value transactions into four payments after the swipe and use the automatic pre-approval button to plan larger transactions and feel confident in your spending power. There are many more features coming over the summer and beyond, most importantly, longer term and interest-bearing loans and Affirm Rewards, but the B1 of Debit Plus is here and ready. We know this because even with this minimalist version, we are seeing an order of magnitude higher engagement among Debit Plus users as compared to non-Debit Plus Affirm users, an average of more than two transactions per week and the Debit Plus experience will continue to improve as we release regular updates to our growing user base. We are inviting tens of thousands of users per day to get their cards and expect to exhaust our now sizable waiting list. We appreciate your patience and open Debit Plus to all eligible Affirm users in fiscal Q4. Eligible here means a certain level of usage history and good standing with Affirm. It is super early and I am still neck-deep in UX optimizations, but I am truly thrilled to begin what we think will be the era of Debit Plus, the simplicity of debit and a flexibility to pay at your own pace with no late or hidden fees. Affirm continues to succeed because of our exceptional team. I have said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, it is a privilege to lead this company, and I would like to thank all Affirmers from marking another waypoint in our journey and to thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support. As you can see, we remain focused on what ultimately matters, results. Now, over to Michael to review those in detail. Before we open for Q&A, I thought it would be helpful to quickly recap the state of play and our plans for Affirm. First, we are laser-focused on scaling the network, increasing our consumer reach and frequency, going deeper with our existing partners and adding new ones. Our opportunities remain fast with significant underpenetrated markets to reach. Second, we will continue investing in our technology, people and brand and doing so is disciplined. We have roughly $3 billion in dry powder, and we firmly believe that we are among the most efficient allocators of capital in the industry. Third, as I already mentioned, with excellent unit economics, consistent focus on risk management and a diversified capital access strategy, our plan is to achieve a sustained profitability run rate on an adjusted basis by the end of the next fiscal year. And finally, at our core, we are builders, excited by the prospect of solving problems and improving lives. We will leverage our scale and reach to introduce brand-new concepts to our merchants and consumers, like Debit Plus, as we continuously expand our product and revenue lines. While the macro environment is uncertain at Affirm, the picture has never been clearer. We are a category leader with massive growth and rapidly expanding market opportunities as the secular trend towards honest, transparent financial products continues. Affirm is in an enviable position given the depth and breadth of our partner network and our unwavering commitment to financial responsibility. As the category begins to go mainstream, the opportunities we can capture are only expanding. We have an incredible team and an inspiring mission. We will continue to scale, drive attractive unit economics and deliver on our mission to improve lives and focus on results. We will now open the line for questions. So the \u2013 about building a network. First of all, thank you for the question, sorry who\u2019ve been listening to us on stuff for a while. So great question. So the thing about building a network is you have to continuously balance the consumer side and the merchant side. So if we are signing on more and more consumers, we are implicitly adding more places where they might want to go shopping. So it\u2019s essential for us to continue launching direct-to-consumer payment products. Because if someone says, hey, I\u2019m a big fan of brand X and I came from a store in Peloton, where I\u2019m not likely to repeat over and over, we have to offer them coverage. Otherwise, they will turn the active consumer. And so the browser extension and the app, which has a marketplace feature in it and the card itself, all things we\u2019re building consumer sites were all fundamentally about retaining consumers and meeting them where they want to go where they want to shop. And so that will continue happening and we see that as both an engagement driver and a revenue driver. Obviously, the products are a little bit different, where we don\u2019t have a direct integration with the merchant. But it does not, in any way, reduce our commitment and just attention to innovation on the merchant side. We have a whole bunch of stuff. I purposely kept my remarks a little bit shorter this time around, but there\u2019s a long list of things that we shipped that have to do with merchants. And I really did not give any credit to those teams just because I wanted to keep it quick. But we\u2019re continuously rolling out really interesting stuff like the active checkout is a really good example of \u2013 it\u2019s just a very, very fundamental piece of tech that we put together. It is the future of the industry. Consumers do not need to go through many different funnels. They just need to pick the right product for them, better yet, we should be there, helping them pick the right product. That\u2019s what I have to check on us. It literally figures out what is the best way of paying for something. So that will continue happening. And part of why we need to continue hiring engineers, you only maintain strong unit economics, if you\u2019re able to offer something that no one else can sell. Competition on price sucks if you have a commodity that everybody else has. If you\u2019re building stuff that no one else got, you can actually sell it at a good price and not worry about someone hiring you. Good question. So first of all, the most important thing to take away is that it really is the scale that\u2019s allowing us to get there. I mean if you look back a few quarters, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re sort of flirting with profitability without ever seeing it out lapped. I think it was a useful and intelligent thing to do to tell the market, hey, we know exactly when it\u2019s going to happen. Here\u2019s a date. But it\u2019s not the same thing as saying, we got to get there fast. So let\u2019s pull some tricks and doing natural things, not at all. And so in that sense, it really is the function. The difficult thing was to build a product that commands a price and maintains a good margin and to be disciplined about credit. You can grow faster if you just approve everyone and some of our competitors do that. And it\u2019s a lot easier, but you then have to deal with bad losses. We are not okay with bad losses or losses that we can control. And so those are all things that we\u2019ve always done, and that\u2019s the scale advantage that we have today is the variable revenue or adjusted. I\u2019m going to trip up on my accounting terms, Michael will correct me later. But at a certain scale, your fixed costs get overwhelmed by our variable revenue is basically what\u2019s happening here. So yes, the statement about profitability is fundamentally about telling the market. We\u2019ve always had a plan. We know where we\u2019re going. Here\u2019s the save of dates. We\u2019ll continue to invest. We are not doing unnatural things to get there. It\u2019s a great question. There\u2019s definitely a lot more to unpack there than I suspect the time allows. Here\u2019s just like bullet points that are sort of easy to rattle off. So the probability of repeating at the same store is, generally speaking, highest for a majority of stores. There are some unique stores where you\u2019re just not going to come back because you already have a fragment. But vast majority of time, especially for some of the largest partnerships, it is highly likely that you will repeat at the store where you came from. Two, there is definitely propensity to repeat on the same product initially. But as each cohort matures and we have more opportunities to teach them what else Affirm can do for them, it widens. Three, there\u2019s a fundamental difference between the behavior of people that have our app and the ones that don\u2019t, like that is just a profoundly different behavioral pattern, and I could write a small science paper on that one. But once you\u2019re using the app, you\u2019re basically starting to think of Affirm as a replacement for your purchasing device. Let\u2019s use that \u2013 let\u2019s see what else can I say very quickly. The last thing that\u2019s worth knowing \u2013 so I\u2019d have to check out, which I sort of bragged about a little bit earlier is basically \u2013 you can think of it as a router for financial tools. We have sort of unpacked the credit card. The idea of like hey, just like your card, we\u2019ll figure it out later, it actually recover interface, it\u2019s terrible for you as they are a financial position, personally, but it\u2019s a really, really nice user interface. And the big thing that we have to accomplish here was to continue offering you but we kind of have to guide you to a good decision because they\u2019re \u2013 already we have a lot of choices and you are used to be no choice at all credit card. So that to checkout is that idea. It\u2019s just where you say, hey, here\u2019s three choices. This one is no interest at all. This one is a little bit longer term, but has some interest, etcetera. As we deploy that across more and more services, you will see more product cross-pollination and we\u2019re right in the middle of just pushing that very, very hard. Like literally, I\u2019m watching the first numbers coming in from some of the deployments outside of our own products. And probably next quarter, we\u2019ll start talking about what that cross pollination really looks like. I\u2019ll start, and Michael will probably give a more precise answer. So we always manage it exactly the same way, like we have not at all changed our approach. We look at both vertical and horizontal slices. We asked the question, how is this in American Society is doing, Canadian, Australian., How are the overall in terms of their job security and sort of the policy set sort of this horizontal slice? And then vertically, we asked the question how is this \u2013 how are the sales in this version category? We know what folks are selling. We know if it\u2019s selling better or worse, which means that the advertising campaigns that drive consumer demand can reach audiences that are potentially overextended already and maybe shouldn\u2019t be borrowing. So, all of that feeds into the policy setting. And then we tune it, but we tend it all the time. It\u2019s not a thing that we sort of get together and say, all right, it\u2019s been a quarter, let\u2019s talk about it. Like we talk about it literally every Monday morning. There is a triage conversation about credits with our head of risk in the room with the executive team and we review all of our numbers. And say, hey, how do we feel about the American consumer at the highest level? And then we dive deep into here\u2019s this product, it\u2019s old split, how is it doing on Shopify? And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s performing a little bit better typically means that the precautionary steps we took were slightly less necessary than we expected \u2013 at least 1 or 2 degrees to the right or to the left. It\u2019s a number \u2013 let\u2019s put a hand break and we over tighten or something like that. We really do not run it like a banquet. And it was very, very. Michael probably have better numerical answers. Stripe is super cool. Basically, one of the common delayed, if you will, when we sign a merchant to launch them the cost always, hey, how long it\u2019s going to be before we can go live and say, hey, we\u2019ve got to put $200 script to your checkout and on your product page and off you go. And then we have to integrate with your payment system and plum, if you will, the settlement and money transfer and everything. And if you have a deal with an existing payment provider for that merchant, EG, FIS or Global Payments or Adyen or Stripe, which is the latest one, you can literally replace that whole back-end integration with, yes, we\u2019ll just route a firm transactions on the that has already been put in there by Stripe. And that\u2019s literally flipping a switch to an enormous number of merchants that have partnered with Stripe, it\u2019s really millions in their case. We also have a bunch of really interesting projects planned with them that probably be on the scope. Again, I would want you to not think of them as an immediately accretive thing, but it is a vast market opportunity that we\u2019re very, very excited. And as a longtime friend and fan of Stripe and full disclosure investor in the company, we\u2019re very happy with the partnership there. All creating these avenues for more growth for many years forward, that\u2019s what this is all about. See, I promised myself and Michael that I will not jump out with a bunch of cool stats. And yet, as an engineer, I am prone to them. Here is a cool one. The number one most visited physical retail used by consumers right now is Walmart groceries, which I think it\u2019s probably true for a lot of America, but it\u2019s, to me, a super anecdotal, so just ignore it, if you will. But it tells you that a subset of consumers that we have given the card to have now used it to buy groceries, which I think that\u2019s probably the sort of fuzziest news I have heard about the product so far. In very, very baby product. It has on the current UX revs, how do need something and it\u2019s going to be in 1,000 before we are satisfied here. But the fact that people are using it to buy food is the best indicator I have heard like we want it to be top of wallet. We want it to be the thing that people take to go shopping for their family, to give them financial flexibility. I have a lot of miles and the commitment to this product to go. In terms of shareable statistics, it\u2019s growing at ridiculous rates right now, but it\u2019s also completely self stimulated in the sense that we are finally opening up to a bunch of users. So, of course, it\u2019s going to grow at crazy rates. At some point, it\u2019s going to even out and then we will know what the natural growth rate looks like. We will open it up to the entire Affirm base. Once the wait list is cleared out, you will just have a button in your Affirm app saying, \u201cHey, do you want your cared,\u201d so we need a little bit more time to scale. Sure. A couple of different reasons, and we talked about this before, so I apologize if this is sort of old news. Vast majority of large enterprise partners that we have won picked us because we span the entire gamut of products possible. If you are just a split pay specialist, it\u2019s great. But if you sell both bicycles and bicycle tires, you will need two providers. And if you are picking a technology partner, and you want to scale, you want to be good at underwriting, you want them to have a good capital markets. You don\u2019t want to go out of business. We did all those criteria really well, but the one thing that we do have is we have excellent well-performing products that meet the price point as the consumer need. That doesn\u2019t \u2013 products is great, but you still may have to integrate those products multiple clients. I have to check out was this idea that what if we gave you just one single integration, and we will guide the consumer to the right financial choice for them so that the consumer satisfaction actually accretes to both us and the brand that we are literally helping the person live a healthier financial life. And so it\u2019s only resonated with our partners. It\u2019s certainly really resonated with us because it\u2019s extremely on mission. And it allows us to just continue driving savings in terms of paid interest to consumers and better conversion to the merchant. So, it\u2019s a it\u2019s almost a meta product. It\u2019s infrastructure for multiple products that we have built in the past to live together in harmony in a single page. And it has been really well received by the market. You are right in that set. And some merchants, by the way, are not really appropriate. If you only sell apparel within sort of a very tight $30 to $50 price range, you might not care about the ability to pay for things over 12 months. But if you are Walmart or an Amazon or many, many, many other merchants that sell multiple SKUs in a fairly wide range of price points that have to check out is the ideal product is you only integrated one, it has old same properties of Affirm and it self-changes to meet the consumer need on the spot without the version having to configure anything. By the way, also supports things like 0% deals or all is something we are famous for it that we have done so well with the last 10 years. It\u2019s all baked inside a set integration. The first part of the question, questions in front of me, sorry. So, the transaction approval rate has not changed very much at all. And again, like we really manage this at a merchant-to-merchant, basket of risk level to basket of risk. There is multiple different acceptance rates. And they are really, really quite different, like it\u2019s just really important to think of Affirm as a \u2013 if you need one number, it\u2019s a weighted average and the weights are quite dramatically different from bucket-to-bucket. That said, the weighted average right now is roughly the same. The reason for it isn\u2019t because there aren\u2019t people paying more or less of their bills. But because the application rates that we have, the number of people asking us for loan vastly exceed the ones that we are actually going to approve. And vastly a little strong, but the approval rates have remained pretty good and remain the same. The point there is our job is to rank risks. We have been quite good historically and intend to remain in the future, very, very good at rank ordering applicants that come through. We have approved the ones we believe can pay their bills. And then after that, we stop. The number of people that ask that can\u2019t pay their bills does not seem to be changing very much. And so the approval rates, therefore, have remained roughly or the acceptance rates have remained roughly the same. I will let Michael as my way through this one, I will let Michael take care of the other half."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Thanks, Max and good afternoon everyone. Our Q3 results and really our performance over the last several quarters demonstrate our ability to deliver impressive growth and attractive unit economics despite a volatile market environment. Once again, we outperformed our outlook for both growth and profitability and our unit economics were strong. We continue to grow both sides of our network. Active consumers increased 137% year-over-year, while active merchants increased to nearly 210,000. Total transactions grew 162% year-over-year and more than 80% from repeat users. Transactions per user, our key frequency metric, increased 19% year-over-year or more than doubling our active user base. And along with that growth, we achieved profitability on a non-GAAP basis, delivering $4 million in adjusted operating income. We grew GMV 73% and nearly doubled GMV when excluding Peloton. Our revenue increased by 54% and our measure of unit economics, revenue less transaction costs, reached 4.7% of GMV. This was a particularly strong result and well above our long-term targeted range of 3% to 4% of GMV. Our outperformance was driven by strong revenue growth, excellent capital markets execution, and better than expected credit performance. While the provision for credit losses increased year-over-year, as a reminder, last year\u2019s provision was net negative given the release of excess COVID-related loan allowance. We also continue to drive greater capital efficiency gains across our funding program as equity capital we used to fund our loans decreased to 2.4% of our platform portfolio versus 4.9% last year. With the strong growth of our business and continued momentum, we are raising our outlook for fiscal year \u201822, which I will discuss more in a moment. Before I do that, let me walk you through our third quarter results in greater detail. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons refer to our third fiscal quarter of \u201822 versus Q3 of fiscal \u201821. We had another great quarter for consumer growth. Active consumers increased 137% to $12.7 million and increased nearly $1.5 million sequentially from fiscal Q2. This growth helped drive 10.5 million transactions in the quarter, a 162% year-over-year increase. Despite adding users at this aggressive pace, we also saw frequency increase as transactions per active consumer grew to 2.7%, up 19% year-over-year. In the third quarter, active merchants grew to nearly 210,000 from this 11,500 last year, thanks to the continued scaling of our partnership with Shopify. On a sequential basis, active merchants, which we calculate over a trailing 12-month timeframe, grew by 39,000 or 23% from the December ending quarter. Turning to GMV. We grew GMV 73% to $3.9 billion in our third quarter, a $1.7 billion increase from last year. As a testament to the increasing depth and breadth of our network, no single merchant accounted for more than 10% of either revenue or GMV for both the 3 and 9 months ending March 31. This demonstrates the continued diversification of our business, which we believe is a key area of strength and resilience for Affirm. Shifting to GMV by vertical. Travel and ticketing increased to $390 million, up 122% from last year, topping last quarter\u2019s high mark. With the recent easing of mass mandates and travel restrictions, we see extraordinary demand to book travel now and pay over time with Affirm. We also remain enthusiastic about consumer demand for live events. General merchandise grew to over $670 million, 448% above last year, driven by our deepening relationships with the world\u2019s largest retailers, which also increases the seasonality of our business. We saw roughly a $200 million sequential decline in GMV within the category, which was in line with our expectations given the seasonally strong holiday shopping season in the December quarter. Sporting goods and outdoors declined to $425 million, down 21% from last year or 20% sequentially from fiscal Q2, driven by a roughly 40% decline in Peloton offset by growth with other connected fitness merchants. PayBright, which we acquired on January 1, 2021, nearly triple GMV, posting annual growth of 198%. We are excited about our prospects and the success we are driving in Canada as well as other expansion opportunities currently on our roadmap. Now turning to the financials. Total net revenue grew 54% to $355 million, well above our outlook of at least $335 million. Network revenue grew 29%, while interest income increased 42% and gain on loan sale increased 221%. Revenue as a percentage of GMV contracted 116 basis points to 9.1%, driven by product mix away from longer duration 0% loans and towards short-term split pay loans. Split Pay GMV grew over 215% year-on-year and accounted for roughly 20% of GMV in the third quarter compared to just over 10% last year. In our earnings supplement posted to our website, you will see that merchant revenue take rates have remained relatively constant for each of our offerings despite our hyper growth. Our strong top line growth and the leverage we achieved on non-provision transaction costs drove a 37% increase in revenue less transaction costs to $182 million or 4.7% at GMV, well above our 3% to 4% long-term target. Total transaction cost of $172 million grew 78% year-over-year compared to revenue growth of 54%. Excluding provision for credit losses, which was negative in the prior year period, transaction cost as a percentage of GMV declined 1.6 points to 2.7%. shift away from longer duration 0% APR loans, loss on loan purchase commitments declined 24%, while improvements in our capital programs helped limit the growth in funding costs to just 8%. Funding costs were an area of considerable leverage in the quarter declining to 0.4% of GMV, down from 0.6% in the prior year period. Provision for credit losses grew from negative $1 million a year ago to $66 million as a year ago figure included a significant release of excess COVID-related loan allowance, while this year\u2019s figure reflects the intentional normalization of credit that we\u2019ve discussed over the past several quarters. Credit performance was better than expected across all credit segments. As small optimizations across our Split Pay and large enterprise programs yielded very favorable outcomes, this led to lower allowance rates on new originations across a large percentage of our GMV. Allowance for losses as a percentage of loans held for investment declined for the second consecutive quarter to 6.4%. The outperformance in revenue less transaction costs and greater operating leverage allowed us to drive better-than-expected adjusted operating income in the period. Our non-GAAP technology and data analytics expense reflects lower-than-expected personnel costs. Affirm has a robust pipeline that calls for more talented engineers than we have the ability to hire in the period. However, we were able to partially address this need from technical talent in early Q4 with the hiring of over 100 engineers for Affirm, primarily from fast in early April. We also continue building our brand through sales and marketing investments, but the majority of these expenses were non-cash in nature. Excluding these non-cash expenses that are fully outlined in our GAAP reconciliation tables posted on our IR website, our sales and marketing expense decreased by $1.7 million or 5% year-over-year, which represents an annual decrease of 5 points as a percentage of revenue. Excluding transaction costs, non-GAAP operating expense grew by $48.9 million or 38%. Adjusted operating income was $4 million in the quarter or 1.1% of revenue, which was significantly above our outlook. GAAP total operating expenses, excluding transaction costs, grew by $66 million or 19%, driven by $102 million increase in warrant expense, partially offset by an $80 million reduction in stock-based compensation. GAAP operating loss was $227 million, which compares to a loss of $209 million last year. The $227 million operating loss number includes $217 million of equity-related costs stemming from our previously granted enterprise partners and stock-based compensation. Before I move to our rate outlook, I\u2019d like to discuss our funding program. We fund the business to optimize for stable, consistent access to deep and diverse pools of capital. We ended the quarter with nearly $9 billion in funding capacity across our three main channels: warehouse lines, forward flow agreements with whole loan buyers and ABS securitizations. 53% of the capacity is off balance sheet, and all of our bilateral relationships are fully committed and generally in multiyear agreements - with only 31% of this capacity maturing in the next 12 months. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we have brought on $2.5 billion in new funding capacity from new and existing capital partners. In addition to that $2.5 billion, subsequent to the quarter end, we closed our $500 million 2022 A revolving ABS transaction. And last week, we also added a new multiyear $500 million forward flow partnership with a large Midwest-based insurance company. We expect to continue to add capital through both scheduled commitment increases from existing partners and onboarding new partners. Our capital program is structured to be resilient, flexible and generate increased velocity as we scale. Let me quickly recap each of our channels. Our warehouse lines are on balance sheet facilities with spreads ranging from 1.65% to 4%, and we were able to advance up to nearly 90% against the loans we pledged. These bankruptcy remote facilities are non-recourse to our parent company and generally used to fund shorter duration collateral. They also serve as a loan aggregation mechanism for our ABS securitization program. We generally maintain these facilities at low utilization rates. This stood at 37% at the end of the quarter, providing us significant excess capacity. Our forward flow program represented close to half of the overall capacity across a range of diverse partners and provides highly efficient off-balance sheet funding. These programs allow us to earn most revenue upfront and additional revenue over time via servicing income. Further, loans sold to third parties via the forward flow program do not require an allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet or any related provision expense on the income statement. Finally, in terms of our ABS securitization program, we have closed 9 securitization transactions that represent roughly $8 billion of volume since launching the program in mid-2020. Our deals have performed really well, and we just achieved our first AAA rating as part of our most recent transaction. Just as we have attracted many leading e-commerce merchants and platforms to Affirm, we have also attracted a diverse set of blue-chip investors to our capital program. This is a real competitive advantage for Affirm. We believe our scale and asset quality will ensure that this advantage continues into the future. Affirm is strongly positioned to continue to drive outsized growth in the ABS market, which is highly liquid with over $1.5 trillion outstanding across all asset classes. Now, let me share some color on our outlook, which you can see on Slide 26 of our earnings supplement. We expect the progress we\u2019ve made thus far in fiscal year \u201822 to continue to drive strong growth in our fourth quarter. Consistent with the public guidance issued earlier this week, we expect the trends observed in Peloton GMV in fiscal Q3 to continue through Q4. We now expect our Split Pay offering to contribute at least 20% of fiscal year \u201822 GMV, with the largest contributor of this volume coming from Shop Pay installments. We expect a sequential increase in total operating expenses outside of transaction costs, driven by the recent hiring of the engineering team from fast in April and marketing campaigns currently planned in the latter half of the quarter. As always, our outlook assumes the current forward interest rate curve. Finally, our outlook does not assume a material impact from the rollout of Debit Plus. For our fourth quarter ending June 30, 2022, we expect GMV of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, revenue of $345 million to $355 million, transaction cost of $185 million to $190 million, revenue less transaction cost of $160 million to $165 million, adjusted operating margin of negative 15% to negative 11% and a weighted average share count of $290 million. For our fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, we now expect GMV of $15.04 billion to $15.14 billion, revenue of $1.33 billion to $1.34 billion, transaction costs of $692 million to $697 million, revenue less transaction cost of $638 million to $643 million, adjusted operating margin of negative 7.6% to negative 6.6% and a weighted average share count of approximately $283 million. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Max for some closing remarks. Yes. We really haven\u2019t had to take any action to date. If you look at the merchant fee rate slide in our supplement, you\u2019ll see, again, relatively constant merchant fees. We view that as a real market of success in the face of pretty heavy competition, we\u2019re able to maintain and even grow in some cases, the merchant side. And of course, as we talk a lot about on the APR side and the consumer side. Those rates are strong enough to allow us to deliver really compelling unit economics. And that\u2019s the lens through which we look at this question. And it is true that as rates go up, there is pressure on the funding side of our business. But it is a mistake to think about that as a flow-through on a linear basis. We have many different funding channels with staggered maturities and very different structures. And as I mentioned, for example, we just onboarded a new fourth flow partner who\u2019s an insurance company has a very different view of rates and how they think about that versus, say, access to quality assets over time. That allows us to manage it in the nearer term. I think in the very long run, so going out more than a year, you would expect us to need to start to take action, but that\u2019s more of a long-term thing than anything we deal with tactically in the near term. No. I think the other thing, guys, is we look at the unit economics in the business whether you measure that to the financial statements like we do in the revenue less transaction costs or you look at on a horizontal basis, and we make sure that there\u2019s enough economic content, and we make sure that we make credit decisions consistent with that. The things we\u2019re always looking at is based upon prior originations, how are they trending against the forecasted numbers. And given the very short duration of our asset, we\u2019re able to get that signal very quickly to feed it back into decisioning. And if you just look at where we\u2019re at right now, we did better on the revenue less transaction cost line in large part because we performed better. This is a bit of a counter signal to what you\u2019re seeing in a lot of other companies right now, and we attribute that mostly to the fact that we\u2019re pretty careful on the front end, and we\u2019re very diligent about managing it as Max alluded to. Yes. I think the easiest way is we feel really, really good. We ended the quarter with $9 billion of capacity. We actually have over $10.1 billion as we sit here today, additional capital that we talked about on the call, the 22A deal and the ABS market as well as the onboarding of the new flow partner. Both of those two are just, we think, massive endorsement of the product. I think it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a good time to remind everybody that there is widespread support for the asset we generate in the capital markets. And we have not seen that be a real difficulty. We have seen the overall macro market change. So that changes rates, it changes spread. But the asset underneath it, the asset we create continues to be something that all of our capital partners, both understand and value and even the rating agent sees value, as I talked about, the AAA rating on the senior tranche in our last ABS deal. That suggests we\u2019re producing really quality assets and it\u2019s linked back to the credit question. So if we keep our eye on the ball, and produce good assets like we have been and will continue to do, we feel really good about it. We\u2019re not giving guidance like you said, for fiscal \u201823, but we feel very good about where we stand. If anything, I think you\u2019re going to see us continue to be slightly larger on capacity or lower in utilization because of the macro concerns, even though we actually don\u2019t have those as a management team. Yes. Thanks for the question, and I appreciate the way you were it. This is definitely, as we say, in and this does not replace our prior nor is it meant to suggest that we think growth will slow. Quite the opposite, as Max talked about. And to be really clear, we do not think that the decisions will take in order to get us to that breakeven or better adjusted operating income will result in any sort of slowdown in growth period. In fact, the growth will allow us to achieve it and the focus on unit economics will get us there inevitably. So don\u2019t \u2013 please don\u2019t read into us suggesting that the growth rates will slow. Quite the opposite, we feel very good about the growth into next year. While we\u2019re not giving any guidance today, I think there are a few trends that are worth highlighting. The first is that, remember, we were experiencing the full year for both Shopify and Amazon. And that\u2019s just the full year with those deals, but the full year with expanded product rollouts, we talked about the expansion on Shopify to new products, including adaptive checkout, but also all the optimizations that Max talks so often about whether it\u2019s the sum of a lot of little things that we\u2019re doing with these large partners. That\u2019s going to be a key avenue for growth for us. And as always, we talk about that plus is the thing that will continue to be very incremental to any of the current run rate in the business. And so we feel really good about growth in the next year. We\u2019re not giving any guidance, but please don\u2019t hear our profitability target as any indication that we expect to slow down quite the opposite. Absolutely not. We feel very strong about our ability to deliver that in any market environment, and we\u2019ll continue to use that as the range talked about in the business. This quarter saw us pretty materially above that range. And again, I would characterize that as being a little bit warmer than we want it to be, 3%, 4% is a very good range for us. This is the 5th straight time we\u2019ve hit our commitments and we would expect to continue to do that, and we\u2019re committed to do 3% to 4%. Yes. Last question first, it\u2019s all the way through June of 2025. The timing \u2013 we are in the midst of rolling out additional products Shopify right now, as Max mentioned. It\u2019s uncertain if it will have any material impact in the next 6 weeks of the quarter, but feel good about it. I think that and the Stripe deal are much bigger going into fiscal \u201823. And then Max maybe you can provide some color on the Stripe deal? So, first, on a non-GAAP basis, you did see sales and marketing come down quite a bit sequentially and really even on a year-on-year basis. That is mostly due to the timing of some marketing campaigns that we run. We talk a lot about this, but our marketing activity isn\u2019t tied to in-quarter revenue or GMV generation. The kind of investments that we have been making over the past year have really been around building a brand and building awareness in the consumer, which has a less direct and less tied to in-quarter performance measure. And that\u2019s why you are able to see in this quarter, really strong growth despite pretty substantially less amount of sales and marketing on a non-GAAP basis. I think going forward, we are not prepared to give you any indication about the shape of the P&L or where we expect those lines to be. But obviously, as we work ourselves towards breakeven or better on adjusted operating income line, we would expect leverage across all of our fixed cost lines. Yes. I appreciate the question. Yes. I think we have said that we would like to be below 5% on a sustainable basis and feel like that\u2019s a good range to be at. You will see an ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter based upon how much forward flow or one-time deals might happen in this last quarter saw a securitization happened early in the quarter, which I guess folks weren\u2019t really attending to that actually allowed us to move quite a bit or 0% paper off the balance sheet. And you can see that as the top bar on that chart, there you see on that slide. That will continue to be the way we want to operate. We want to be both durable and the quantum of capital that we have access to. We want to deliver the economics that we have signed up for and be very efficient with the shareholders\u2019 capital. We definitely never want to let growth be impacted by our capital program. So, we are always going to be overfunded with excess capacity, and you have seen us do that this past quarter and we will do that into the future while still delivering the strong units. So, I would say that it would be below 5%. I don\u2019t know that would stay in the 2% range sustainably. And again, I would just reiterate that I think our team is doing a very good job executing in these pretty volatile markets. And we are pretty proud of the access to capital that we enjoy right now because we generate a high-quality asset. And my team is alerting me that I misspoke earlier in Q3 was an interest-bearing not as your present in any event it got off sheet and priority execution. I wanted to make sure they got written so they don\u2019t get attacked. Yes. I mean the allowance is always the current estimate as a percentage of loans held for sale, the current estimate of future allowances. And so that 6.4% where we ended up, that\u2019s where we would expect it to be on a percentage basis. If you want more of a kind of backward-looking measure, that\u2019s where we show the delinquency performance and you see that\u2019s trending on, I guess, it\u2019s Slide 21 of the supplement, you can see where that\u2019s trending. Charge-offs are a bit difficult to get too much information out of given that we charge off at 120 days. So, it\u2019s pretty difficult to really get a sense of how credit performance is reflected through the charge offline. And again, the short duration of our asset mix that double true. Yes. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t. No. But what we did say in the\u2026 Dan, you and I both do as not true. The thing we said in the call, the prepared remarks, which is true, is that no partner was more than 10% of GMV or revenue on a three-month and nine-month basis. So, you can get some sense there. We also showed you the general merchandise category, which is inclusive of some of the largest retailers in the world, grew to over $670 million. So, those are the stats we can share. Yes. I think that reflects a number of factors, which is execution. Remember, the \u2013 we talked about it a lot, but rates moving does impact us, but not in the near-term. Most of our is locked in and committed. Very little of it is truly floating. And if you look at our warehouse that limits the amount of funding rate exposure that we have. And then just generally, we have a lot of very well-executed capital markets activity over the past 18 months that reflects in really strong performance. Yes. So the DQ chart does not exclude Split Pay, the vast majority of our balances on total platform portfolio basis or no Split Pay. The Split Pay asset is a 50-day asset. We have $120 charge-off policy. So, as you can imagine, the way that actually works with respect to the delinquency calculation doesn\u2019t really make sense to look at on a Q3 basis. I think it\u2019s pretty misled to look at it that way. In terms of where it\u2019s going, we would expect to continue to track at or below the \u201819 levels on a portfolio basis based upon our current projections."

Hosting today's call are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'd like to turn over the call to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Hello, and thank you for joining us on this earnings call. Affirm is just a handful of days away from its tenth anniversary and this earnings report also marks the first anniversary of our public debut. While the road ahead of us is significantly longer than the one we've traveled so far, the occasion does warrant a moment of reflection on the execution of our strategy during the last 12 months. We feel great about our progress. We remain quite unpivoted and focused on delivering long-term compounding value to all our stakeholders, consumers, merchants, employees and shareholders. As we introduced ourselves to the public markets a year ago we talked about several key themes. First and foremost is our mission, which is to deliver honest financial products to improve lives and to do so while delighting the people we get to serve every day. Because the opportunity embedded in our mission is still so vast and open consumer growth is very important to Affirm. We've done very well. Indeed our active consumer growth accelerated growing by 150% to provide well north of 11 million people with a smarter way to pay. Growth for us is never just about getting the next million consumers. It's also about the impact we can have on the financial well-being of the folks who rely on Affirm. I\u2019ve also talked about our other all important constituent, the merchant. Affirm is as much a safe and transparent pay-over-time option for the buyer, as it is the ultimate marketing tool for the seller. We help our partners drive meaningful incremental sales without needing to resort to gimmicks or discounting. The number of active merchants on our platform is another key measure for Affirm and over the last year, we've significantly expanded our reach. There too, we accelerated with a more than 20x increase from a year ago and a 64% increase from the rolling 12-month tally we reported just 90 days ago. As a company founded by engineers, we focused early on investing heavily in technology, scalable enough to economically support the smallest of businesses all the way up to the world's largest retailers. We've continued this policy of investment and development in pursuit of technological competitive superiority. The strategy is working and delivering results. In fact, our technology is what has enabled us to work with tech savvy giants, such as Walmart, Shopify, Amazon and Target. We estimate that this year, Affirm processed 1.6% of all US outline transaction volume for the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period, another triple-digit increase from last year. Simultaneously, a momentous number and a signifier of just how early we are in this market. Even a decade in the ramp-up to the holiday shopping rush is an intense yet exhilarating exercise in scalability preparedness. Each year's Black Friday weekend brings by far the greatest number of concurrent transactions we've ever experienced. I'm very proud of our engineering teams for delivering another flawlessly executed record-breaking Black Friday weekend, and I'm also grateful to our friends at Shopify engineering, who had lent some of their technical expertise to us as we prepped in the days before. It is an off-treated outage that product innovation slows down, as companies go public. I'm pleased to report that we were able to accelerate our product delivery since the IPO. We've rolled out cash back rewards for participating merchants, delivered the unique adaptive checkout, launched the Affirm SuperApp and the Affirm Chrome extension and introduced the beta version of super simple consumer-friendly crypto savings. You may have noted the announcement of Visa being the launch partner for Debit+ which is now in the initial waitlist rollout. Though I will continue to caution you to not yet give crazy forecasting this product's impact on our P&L at scale, I do have fun insight to share. On average, the number of weekly transactions by Debit+ consumer, excluding our own employees is greater than an order of magnitude above that of a regular Affirm user. Of course, these are enthusiastic early adopters and we fully expect the number to normalize, but it's exciting to see first glimpses of what Affirm as a daily instrument might look like. We remain very excited about the future of this product, and expect to talk a lot more about it this year. We had said last year that BNPL is an international phenomenon and we intend to bring Affirm's unique no late fees, no grudges, no regress approach well beyond our home borders. Over the last 12 months, we've solidified our industry leadership with PayBright by Affirm in Canada and launched in Australia our first non-North American market, and the growth of our business continues to accelerate. Affirm had more than 16,000 active merchants on the platform as of the end of calendar 2021, largely thanks to our partnerships with online commerce platforms. In aggregate, Affirm is now present on sites that account for more than half of all US e-commerce and that number continues to march higher every day. In our second quarter, year-over-year GMV growth accelerated to 115% from 84% in the first fiscal quarter. Moving beyond the testing phase of our collaboration with Amazon before the holidays was a significant driver of this growth. However, if you exclude Amazon, our GMV still doubled year-over-year. We are highly cognizant of the fact that over 80% of commerce is still conducted offline. Our recently announced partnerships with Verifone and Adient are just two of the numerous investments we're making with our partners to bring honest financial products to consumers at the physical point-of-sale. We're also expanding the ability to use Affirm in-store with our own products like Debit+. Our focus on using exceptional technology to drive growth and improve efficiency has been a winning strategy for Affirm, and we never stopped finding ways to optimize and deliver even more value. This shows up in our results in a number of ways from new partnerships to long-standing relationships. For example, iterating over the last three years, our relationship with Walmart has grown, as we prove the value of our products. We expect similarly great things from our other major partnerships with time. As we develop with and learn from each customer, we are excited to bring these learnings and the products they engender to all merchants big and small. The strength of our network is measured in merchant coverage and repeat consumer engagement both of which are rising rapidly. We grew total transactions by 218% and transactions per active user by 15% year-over-year even as we added a tremendous number of new consumers. Our momentum is strengthening. Our strategy is working and we are extending our lead. We intend to double down on the three key things that got us here: One, deliver unique and delightful financial products that align fully with our mission; Two continue to be the partner of choice for merchants that care about intelligent growth scalability and reliability; and three deepen our underwriting advantage. Speaking of underwriting. We manage risk, though we are an easy-to-understand tool to maximize one's personal capital and the retail marketers, best friend. At our core Affirm is ultimately a risk managing business. We facilitate the transaction settle with the merchant soon thereafter and bill the buyer over a predetermined period of time.  But wait there's more. When we charge interest which we don't always do, we don't compound it into principal. Moreover, we don't compound interest after it reaches the amount we communicated to the consumer at purchase time. We refine interest when the buyer prepays. We don't even charge late fees. These are all deliberate choices made in the first few days of our company's life. We meant to align ourselves with our consumers in this manner avoiding the moral hazard of capitalizing on their mistakes for revenue opportunities. These decisions are as on mission and moral as they are self-serving. These policies are an important part of why our consumer satisfaction is so high and we only wanted to go up. With the self-imposed guardrails exceptional underwriting and risk management frameworks are a requirement. That's why we underwrite every transaction before making a credit decision unlike some of our competitors in the BNPL space who readily admit they do no underwriting at all. It is also important to understand that unlike many players in our industry we do not treat delinquencies or defaults as an outcome of our business decisions. Indeed, we choose acceptable delinquency rates as an input into our decision-making, based on the pricing our products command with our customers, our view of the macroeconomic conditions and the demand for our loan volume in the capital markets. This distinction may seem subtle, but I think it really helps understand our approach to risk. We spent the last decade building what we believe to be one of the best-in-class credit underwriting ecosystems. Data, tools processes and teams that deliver underwriting models with some of the very best results in the industry. Today I'll pull the curtain back a little and while I will keep it very high level in part to avoid giving out trade secrets feel free to tune out for a few minutes while I nerd out. Affirm's underwriting advantage begins before any of our models are interrogated for a decision with our product design. Because Affirm is predominantly offered at the point of sale, we have a natural opportunity to explain our value and transparent approach to the consumer. As a result, we avoid much of the adverse selection that often comes with traditional lending. Coupled with the SKU level data we receive from our partners our models tend to split the risk far better than those used in traditional consumer loans. Another fundamental structural advantage Affirm has, is its total separability of transactions. Unlike providers of lines of credit, we underwrite transactions individually modeling a consumer's ability to pay us back, as well as their propensity to do so. This notion of separability is also recursive a consequence of our product because repayment schedules are highly predictable our models operate at an individual installment level. This separability is a powerful tool for modeling as well as managing risk. We're able to deliver a reliable forward-looking picture of both consumers and our own cash flow. Our proprietary network of directly integrated merchants as well as other sources of non-traditional underwriting data offers us a significant raw data advantage into feature engineering. We maintain a library of over 500 features that we select from as we create new models or update existing ones, while continuously looking for and eliminating any potential for disparate impact in our decisioning both at individual variable and model levels. We train our models using academically well-understood and boosting technique with significant proprietary modifications we've invented that help us improve results. Because from the very beginning, we focused equally on consumer and merchant information, we ended up with a large number of models that are specific to our products and merchants who use them. Moreover, as we launch new products with new and existing partners, we acquire new types of data that we incorporate into the models and over time give incremental weight too. Underwriting models decay over time, as macroeconomic conditions and consumer behaviors change. Even the very best performing ones can loose a few percentage points of their area under the curve every few months. Over the years, we've built special-purpose models that track model decay, the machine learning equivalent of a canary in the coal mine. Our proprietary software and processes allow us to rapidly retrain, retest and redeploy models where the performance has deteriorated in a matter of days. To illustrate this, let's take a side-by-side look at ITACS, one of our longest-serving proprietary models versus a traditional credit scoring system like FICO. Using ITACS reducing originations by 10% would eliminate one-third of all delinquencies in dollars, while using the traditional credit scoring system would only reduce delinquencies by a mere 13%. Let's take it a step further. If we were to reduce originations by 30% using ITACS, we would remove 70% of all delinquencies, while the traditional score would only catch 36%. So needless to say, this model slopes a lot better than the traditional industry standard. These achievements may sound quite abstract, but they have a very real impact with our superior underwriting capabilities. Affirm can approve many more college students buying tickets to see family after months of pandemic isolation and young parents picking up their first stroller. And because Affirm's average loan duration at origination by design is very short, at just 5.2 months, the exceptional precision and recall of our credit models give us great confidence that our portfolio both retained and sold will continue to perform well in the future. Any use of advanced technology has both advantages and risks associated with it. As we push our model performance further in pursuit of expanding our offerings, we work just as diligently on ensuring that our models are both compliant with all applicable laws and rules and that our model decisions are both reasonable and are understandable by consumers. We regularly audit our models to avoid correlation with prohibited basis and have them audited externally. We also invest heavily in explainability of model outcomes, so that both consumers and regulators can understand our decisions quite easily. None of this of course would exist without the extraordinary team of people that make it all possible. I am truly fortunate to have been able to start this company with a group of brilliant minds, who in turn attracted more and more talented folks to join our mission and bring their mathematical and other talents to bear. It is this embarrassment of riches among my teammates that makes me so optimistic about the next decade of Affirm. Large as some of these numbers might be, Affirm still accounts for around 1% of US e-commerce and both consumers and merchants are genuinely excited to get more value from Affirm. And we are excited to deliver it. As usual I want to thank my team for all their amazing work. And even during some pretty volatile moments for our stock price for staying truly focused on the long-term value creation for all our stakeholders and on our mission. Now on to Michael for the numbers. \nMichael Linford: Thanks, Max and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrated a massive step change in our network scale driven by our partnership with the largest enterprises and our technology advantage. Growth accelerated on both sides of our network as active consumers more than doubled, while active merchants increased more than 20 times. Frequency increased alongside that explosive user growth. Total transactions grew 218%, the fastest rate since our Series D private funding round. We grew GMV 115% in revenue by 77%. In November, we completed the rollout of our initial offering at Amazon in the United States. And even excluding Amazon's contribution we significantly exceeded our outlook for both GMV and revenue. Unit economics were also strong. Revenue less transaction costs grew faster than revenue at 93% from the prior year. And even as we accelerated network growth, we continue to operate with efficiency reducing the equity capital we used to fund our loans by 17% versus last year. With the accelerating growth of our business and the early traction with our enterprise partners, we are raising our outlook for fiscal year 2022, which I'll share more about in a moment. Before I do that let's walk through the second quarter results. Unless stated otherwise all comparisons refer to our second fiscal quarter of 2022 versus Q2 of fiscal 2021. We had another great quarter for consumer growth. Active consumers increased 150% to 11.2 million and increased 2.5 million sequentially from fiscal Q1. Despite adding users at this aggressive pace we grew transactions per active consumer by 15% year-to-year and more than tripled the number of transactions. More merchants, platforms and brands are leveraging the power of Affirm to grow their businesses. In the second quarter active merchants grew to more than 168,000 from just 8,000 last year thanks in large part to the scaling of our partnership with Shopify. On a sequential basis active merchants which we calculate over a trailing 12-month time frame grew 64% from the September ending quarter. Turning to GMV. We grew GMV to $4.5 billion in our second quarter a $2.4 billion increase from last year. The 115% increase includes the volume from our partnership with Amazon. We completed the launch of our interest-bearing program at Amazon in November ahead of Black Friday. And while the program is still in its infancy with a long road map of optimizations to work on we've seen rapid consumer adoption. We look forward to years of growth in this collaboration. We have strong momentum across our business. Excluding Amazon GMV doubled with growth across all products and verticals. We I would also note that our business with Peloton our second largest merchant partner by GMV in the quarter was up against an unusually strong prior year comp following the launch of a new product slate and boosted by COVA tailwinds. As a testament to the increasing depth and breadth of our network no single merchant accounted for more than 10% of Q2 GMV. One year ago we discussed how we would expand into higher frequency purchase areas and diversify our merchant partnerships. A year later I'm really proud of how our team has delivered on these objectives for our shareholders. the industry vertical. We have phenomenal holiday season. We more than doubled our volume from Black Friday Cyber Monday, and we believe we took significant market share from both traditional incumbents and BNPL pure plays. As Max shared, we estimate that Affirm facilitated 1.6% of total online transaction volume for the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period in the US, and we saw particular strength in key holiday categories in Q2. Travel and ticketing increased, up 314% from last year, topping last quarter's high mark even despite the emergence of the Omicron variant. General merchandise grew 368% above last year, driven by our deepening partnership with the industry's leading retailers and the launch of our offering at Amazon in the US. Consumer electronics, which grew 209% year-to-year was another great story driven by strong demand for TVs, laptops and gaming consoles. Our results this holiday season highered our ability to take share and grow in any environment. And importantly, why we're so different from the composition. Outside the US, we had another outstanding quarter. Our Canadian business more than tripled in size, thanks to existing and new partnerships, including Apple which launched in the fall to brisk consumer demand. In the second quarter, we also entered the Australian market with Peloton, and look forward to growing our business with them there. This quarter, our interest-bearing program which includes our initial offering at Amazon grew significantly up 124% year-on-year to $1.4 billion. Before, I jump into the financials, let me walk through the mechanics of this offering to illustrate the impact on the income statement. On the revenue side, we monetize these loans by either holding them to maturity or selling them to third parties. When we hold the loans, we primarily earn interest income, which we recognize over the duration of the loan. Hence, this quarter's revenue reflects just a portion of the total yield we will ultimately see from the GMV, we generated in Q2. We will recognize the balance over the subsequent quarters. As an illustrative data point, we sold 59% of the interest-bearing loans generated in the US this quarter, and retained the remainder. On the expense side, we provision for credit losses upfront for loans we hold this means that the margin profile is back-end weighted. Our partnerships with key enterprise merchants are unlocking more opportunities for our business every day and we are investing today to realize the full long-term potential. While we are just in the beginning stages in scaling these partnerships, we are already seeing them drive network expansion and we expect to deliver strong unit economics when they reach scale. Now turning to the financials, the strong GMV growth also drove strong revenue growth. Net revenue grew 77% to $361 million, well above our outlook. Total network revenue grew 39%, while interest income increased 87% and gain on loan sale rose four-fold. Revenue as a percentage of GMV contracted 170 basis points to 8% driven by product mix. Split Pay grew over four times year-on-year, and accounted for more than 20% of GMV in the second quarter from just 11% last year. In our earnings supplement posted to our Investor Relations website you will see that merchant revenue take rates have remained relatively constant for each of our offerings. On the expense side, we continue to grow revenue faster than transaction costs delivering real leverage. Total transaction costs of $177 million grew 63% year-over-year compared to revenue growth of 77%. And excluding provision for credit losses, transaction cost as a percentage of GMV declined 190 basis points to 2.8%. Given the mix shift from longer duration 0% APR loans, loss on loan purchase commitments declined 4%, while improvements in our capital programs helped limit the growth of funding cost to 47%. Provision for credit losses grew for $13 million when a year ago to $53 million as the year ago figure included a $39 million release of excess COVID-related loan allowance, while this year's figure reflects the intentional normalization of credit that we've discussed over the past several quarters. Over the first half of the fiscal year, we have managed delinquencies of 30 days or more to remain below the same periods of fiscal 2019 and 2020, even as we have expanded the credit box to a more normalized level compared to the early days of pandemic. Our strong top line growth and leverage we achieved on transaction costs drove a 93% increase in revenue less transaction costs to $184 million, above our outlook range or 4.1% of GMV. Looking at OpEx beyond transaction costs. We continue to invest in building our team and elevating our brand. We doubled headcount to more than 2000 Affirmers and increased marketing around the holidays. Our teams have delivered a torrent of exciting new offerings. While our brand campaign drove greater awareness across all age cohorts and helped us reach the highest aided awareness among BNPL providers at 45%. Growing our team resulted in higher personnel costs and stock-based compensation. In Q2, total operating expenses, exclusive of transaction costs, grew $258 million, of which $158 million was related to D&A, stock-based compensation, foreign expense and one-time expenses related to our IPO and acquisitions. Excluding these items, non-transactional operating expenses grew 109%. On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $196 million, which compares to a loss of $27 million last year. Adjusted operating loss was $8 million in the quarter compared to a $3 million of income in the prior year. Now turning to our balance sheet. We fortified our cash position and delivered accelerating GMV growth while continuing to manage our capital with discipline and efficiency. In November, we issued $1.7 billion in zero coupon senior convertible notes with a five-year maturity, which has significantly increased the capital we have to invest in growth, at an extremely attractive long-term borrowing costs, while minimizing dilution. Our effective capital markets program and disciplined approach helped to reduce equity capital used to fund our business from $277 million last year to $230 million even as loans on the balance sheet grew by more than $500 million. As a percentage of total platform portfolio, equity capital required declined to 3.6% from 7.5% last year. Total platform portfolio grew 72% from $3.7 billion to $6.3 billion at the end and we increased our overall funding capacity in line from $4.7 billion last year to $8.8 billion. Over the past year, we brought on $1.9 billion in new loan buyer commitments from both new and existing capital partners. Our balance is held by third-party loan buyers from our forward flow program grew 129% to $3.7 billion while our securitization program grew 83%. Our health balances declined 24% as we continue to focus on more efficient funding vehicles. Before I move to our outlook, I want to touch on an important topic that has been top of mind for investors' interest rates. While potential interest rate hikes have dominated headlines, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow rapidly while delivering strong economics as rates rise. Our financial outlook already reflects a roughly 180 basis point increase embedded in the three-month LIBOR forward curve and our current long-term model which caused a revenue less transaction cost of 3% to 4% also assumes rate normalization. We have significant advantages to help us mitigate the impact of rising rates, including broad and diverse funding partnerships, that allow us to shift funding to less rate-sensitive counterparties, sophisticated underwriting and risk management infrastructure that allows us to manage unit economics with changes to our cost environment and high turnover short-term assets that make our portfolio inherently nimble and able to react quickly to changing market conditions. At a constant product and funding mix, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase beyond the increase implied by the current yield curve would only result in a 10 to 20 basis point impact to revenue-less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV for the remainder of fiscal year 2022. Looking out to fiscal 2023, we believe that a further 100 basis point rate increase, again beyond current expectations would only result in approximately 20 basis point impact to revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV based upon our current funding and GMV mix. And that is before we apply any of the numerous offsets we have including consumer and merchant pricing, funding strategies and credit optimizations. Looking beyond fiscal year 2023 at our current funding and product mix, we estimate the impact to revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of to be approximately 40 basis points for every 100 basis points of rate movement beyond the current forward curve. And again that\u2019s before applying any cost, credit and revenue optimization. Now turning to the outlook. Our business has never been stronger. And as we look through the remainder of our fiscal year, we are raising our financial outlook to reflect the robust second quarter results, accelerating momentum in the business and we are now including Amazon's expected contribution to the outlook. For fiscal year 2022, we now expect GMV to be between $14.58 billion and $14.78 billion, representing a 76% to 78% increase from fiscal year 2021. Given the strong traction we're seeing with Shopify, we now expect our Split Pay offering to comprise 15% to 20% of total GMV for the fiscal year. We expect revenue of $1.29 billion to $1.31 billion representing year-over-year growth of 48% to 50%. We expect transaction costs of $705 million to $715 million, resulting in revenue less transaction cost of $585 million to $595 million. This reflects the continued mix shift we are seeing in the business. We expect an adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 12% to 14% as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business and weighted average shares of approximately $285 million. Consistent with Max's remarks, Affirm does not assume a material impact from the rollout of Debit+. We also expect a very strong fiscal third quarter with GMV of $3.61 billion to $3.71 billion, total revenue of $325 million to $335 million; transaction costs of $187 million to $192 million and revenue less transaction costs of $138 million to $143 million. Adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 19% to 21% and weighted average shares outstanding of $290 million. In closing, we just posted an incredible quarter of great and our team is seizing this momentum to continue to deliver on our mission. I'd like to add my thanks to the great work of all Affirmer\u2019s this quarter. Max and I will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  \nRon Clark: Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to briefly address the earlier than customary issuance of our earnings press release today. Due to human error, a small portion of our Q2 results were inadvertently tweeted from Affirm's official Twitter account earlier today. And because of that we felt it was appropriate to release our full financial results as promptly as possible thereafter rather than waiting until after the market closed. With that, I'll turn it over to Doug to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you, very much. I guess my first question is obviously, the December quarter was massive for you guys. But the outlook doesn't seem as comparatively strong, especially the March quarter and particularly, if we're now incorporating more split pay from Shopify and Amazon et cetera. Can you walk us through kind of that dynamic, especially on a sequential basis? I mean, is this seasonality more than expected drag from Peloton impact of revenue timing on Amazon and others. Just kind of help us understand the sequential evolution of the business?\nMichael Linford: Yes. I'll grab that one. And I think to start off, we're very happy with the pace of scaling in the network. The Q4 results, as you said were pretty spectacular -- sorry calendar Q4 results were pretty spectacular and it was indeed a special quarter. We are reiterating our guidance and taking it up. So, our outlook continues to improve for the balance of the fiscal year. And we're still well in excess of the high growth phase. We're in the hyper growth phase for the stock. And so we feel really good about the scaling that we're doing. Yes, there are impacts of seasonality. Calendar Q4 tends to be heavier with holiday shopping. As I shared in my remarks, we had a really strong holiday season. So there's a little bit of sequential impact there. And yes, the growth in interest-bearing will tend to create some back-endedness to both the revenue and margin profile of those originations. But again, I think we're very happy with the pace of which we're scaling and we're certainly not focused on or concerned with the next quarter. We're really looking about where this network will be over the next decade.\nJames Faucette: And then Michael, this is probably also for you, but -- and I think, both of -- you and Max highlighted that there's been a lot of questions around interest rates. But a lot of the other questions have to do with delinquencies et cetera. And as you said, is that you're kind of close to your target. But -- we noticed that the most recent update at least in the supplemental indicated the percentage of 30-day delinquency started to turn down and away from kind of your 2% target in recent weeks. Is that purely because of the nature of the incremental mix from the likes of Amazon or better consumer repayments, or are you tightening the credit standards? And how should we expect that to evolve in coming quarters?\nMichael Linford: Very good question. If you look at the chart that we have in the supplement, you can see the seasonality curve of delinquencies and there's actually quite a bit of seasonality tied to both the shopping seasons and the repayment schedules have happened. And we're back to a more normalized seasonality curve with respect to what you see in delinquencies. And to reiterate the point, I mean we're very happy with the credit outcomes we're driving right now. And we take a very intentional approach here and we have intentionally been losing the credit box over the past year. We're still below 2019 and 2020 numbers, fiscal 2019 and 2020 and feel really good about the level of delinquency in light of the total unit economics that we're driving. And the only other thing I'd add is that, we really do manage to a total portfolio number here. There's a bit of a misunderstanding we think out there with folks looking at not the portfolio delinquencies, but looking at one securitization vehicle or one particular slice of our business. We are very thoughtful about portfolio construction that goes into any one of our funding vehicles. And each one has a unique profile based upon market demand and our needs. For example, the split pay content may change. We made pledge loans that have sensor delinquency, et cetera. And so no one securitization, data set can really represent the portfolio and would really encourage everybody to look at our investor supplement to see a real view of portfolio-wide DQs. \nJames Faucette: That's great, Michael. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Michael, you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks in terms of slide 13, which has the merchant fee rates. And you're right, overall, most of the lines are pretty stable. I wanted to see if we could just touch on a few of them that are moving around a little bit, specifically the dark blue, which is the split pay seems to be ticking up a little bit in terms of the take rate. I was thinking maybe that could be related to Shopify, also the purple line which is the Core IB, just ticking down a hair maybe related to Amazon? And then if you could help us maybe elaborate on either of those and also the green the non-integrated virtual card would really appreciate that context?\nMichael Linford: Yes. The last we have the least amount of control over that really is a function of the network interchange that we earn. And I think you nailed it. The line that you see on split pay merchant fee rates up versus Q1, we were promotional with Shopify in particular in Q1, but really up even year-on-year back to the fiscal Q2 in 2021. So, we feel really good about our resiliency with respect to the most competitive space, which is the split pay product set. The IB line that you point out is a function of the growth that we have in our largest enterprises, we would earn less there than we would everywhere else. And part of the reason we're so confident in how we're growing is those two things mix in our favor, where you've got a lot of growth in the split pay offering with really high merchant fees and you have a lot of user growth that comes along with that combined with these enterprise scale offerings that will drive tremendous processing volume as well as in the long run we think really strong economics. So, we feel really good about the mix really want investors to understand that when you average -- when you have the sort of major shifts in the mix in the portfolio, it will shake out differently in the income statement. \nTimothy Chiodo: Thank you. Point well taken there on the various mix dynamics. I appreciate it. Quick follow-up is on processing costs. So fully appreciate that the Shopify revenue share will hit in that line item, which could cause a little bit of upward pressure on that specific expense line, but a potential offset could be reduced card mix within their loan repayment. Is there any potential for you to work with someone like a Plaid or a Finicity to help increase the mix of direct bank account repayment? \nMax Levchin : Yes. There is a potential. I was just starting to fall asleep, because you guys are asking Michael excellent questions, and he's doing a great job answering -- the sorry -- the longer it is it's exactly right. The way I think and it goes back many years now, the way we look at our transactional economics is in credit dimensions one is of course lifetime consumer kind of managing credit side of it. But if you -- on the ROA basis, you have to look at the charge-offs that you incur -- and once you -- Michael touched this really well and it's kind of a whole lot of my script, but basically we manage it to a number. We decide what that's going to be and we drive that to eight basis points that we like per product, per merchant, et cetera. After you're done with that you look at your other costs and servicing is the one where we're always really hesitant to mess too much, because you want the consumer experience to be amazing. And obviously, over time we'll optimize that to a perfect number for the sort of, the high-touch wide webservices have created is really, really valuable to us. We're completely ruthless on the rest of it. The repayment cost is something that just screams 80 basis points away. And you're totally right there's lots and lots of opportunity. The repayment devices or vehicles are not all created equal. There's some really interesting innovation happening even sort of beyond ACH which is currently kind of the most popular flash cheapest one. And so we will absolutely do a lot of things there. It is more important in this whole story of this quarter we're reporting and going forward we're still taking enormous amounts of white space. The growth of the network is what we are grading ourselves on right now. We are paying attention to cost at scale be real dollars and we'll invest in a reduction of these costs involved. And we guessed pretty well where opportunities are. \nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. Thank you, Michael and Max.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question this evening. I wanted to ask about the spread between volumes and revenue less transaction costs and just kind of get your expectations about where those kind of, yields should sort of trend and shake out over the next few quarters? Where do they exit the year? What should we think about in terms of next year modeling them out? If you could comment on that that would be very helpful. \nMichael Linford: Yes. We're not ready to give guidance for 2023. So I'll avoid that one. But I think the guide that you see and the results we just posted we talk a lot about the long-term economics of the business being somewhere between 3% and 4% on a revenue-less transaction cost basis. And we're on the higher end of that last quarter and inside the guidance for the back half of the year as well. While I think there -- it is changing quite quickly with respect to the product level economics. If you're taking on a Split Pay product with 5% to 5.5% merchant fees you're not going to be making four points of margin. And so you do expect a little bit of compression on a percentage of GMV basis on the Split Pay business. And yet the opposite is true on our interest-bearing business where we're able to earn even higher total revenue transaction costs but over time. And I think as we continue to scale some of our enterprise partnerships you're going to see some again back-endedness to the timing of those things. So our guidance reflects the mix that we expect over the next six months. And we'll update everybody with 2023 back when we talk later this year, but we're not at all concerned with our long-term guidance of staying in the 3% to 4% range, which we believe is still materially better than our competition. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And I guess more broadly on profitability, can you kind of give us your updated view on the, sort of, longer-term multiyear path to profitability as ramping up any of these larger -- significantly larger partners like the Amazons of the world maybe faster than expected the ramp-down of Peloton. Has there been any change to your view or approach or ability to kind of solve for profitability at the same pace over the longer term? \nMichael Linford: No. I mean Max's line in the setup today what I'd like to reiterate which is our strategy hasn't changed. We talked about the financial model and framework in September and that remains true, no matter the macro conditions changing. While we have the opportunity to grow at this pace with what we think are industry-leading unit economics, we're not going to take our foot off the gas and we're going to keep scaling up the network. And the path towards profitability, the long-term financial profile of the business remains the same and it is a function of us achieving scale greater than where we're adding human capital. Human capital is what's driving all of these we think fantastic results and we're still well prepared to keep investing into what we think is an incredible growth opportunity.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. Appreciate. Thanks so much.\nMax Levchin: Just one more one more way of thinking about it that I guess utilize. And fundamentally just from going back to my experience odd years ago, pricing power of a payments network is directly proportionate to the number of active users it has. Like ultimately, when you come to market and say I have a product and I would like you to buy my way of delivering tender, the price that product is able to command is inevitably a function of how many people are using that product, prefer it, would like to use that to check out, whatever we want to call it. And so the reason we are so consumer growth and coverage obsessed isn't for some sort of a vanity number but the fact that ultimately we intend to come to market and say, we are the largest network. We are the most active network. We would like you to pay for that appropriately. And so this growth is a direct tie to the path to profitability.\nRamsey El-Assal: I see. Great. So not too much has changed since your prior view despite other businesses evolve. I appreciate it. Thanks for your answers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Perlin: Thanks and good evening, guys. I wanted to ask a question around the kind of frequency of repeat customers versus the first-time users. You have a slide on that a little bit. And the question is really the interplay there between your customer acquisition model and how we should be thinking about that influencing cost into the second half of the year and maybe even into next year?\nMichael Linford: I'll start and then Max can add on. I mean I think we're actually \u2013 we included that slide in the supplement because we're really proud of what's going on underneath the surface, where we have a step change in the number of users 150% growth and increasing frequency when you have that much user growth is actually really challenging. And if you look at a chart and look at just the total transactions from repeat users and the growth there alongside the net new user growth. It is a really \u2013 which feels like a really good spot the business. There is some impact with respect to the rate of new user growth on unit economics. First time use tends to be slightly less profitable than the lifetime value of the consumer. And so you do have a little bit of start-up costs associated with that user growth. But as Max mentioned before, long-term, that's much more important to us. So we're going to keep adding users at a very aggressive clip. We're going to stay focused on that. And part of the reason we have so much confidence in the long-term economics is that's happening right alongside tremendous growth in repeat usage on the platform. And we talked about network effects in the business. That's what that means. And in the long run it gives us all the confidence in the world around where the economics will ultimately be. \nDan Perlin: Yes. I thought that was a pretty impressive set of numbers as you think about growing the network that quickly to have that level of frequency so quickly. So \u2013 the other question I have do you have any insight that you could share with us around kind of January trends in particular around the health of maybe some of the lower income cohorts that might be coming into the portfolio. I know some players out there have some concerns around what that dynamic is looking like. So if you could share any of those that would be great. Thank you.\nMichael Linford: Yeah. I think what you saw in the disclosure around the delinquency trend is similar to -- I think, you should think about it which is to-date our credit outcomes are still a function of the decisions we've taken with respect to approval rates. There's obviously any number of seasonal effects that do require taking a fine tooth co-mover. But not seeing the broader weakness that others have seen in our overall credit performance. And feel really good about where we're at. And that's what gives us again the confidence to give the guide that we have for this quarter.\nDan Perlin: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey. Thanks guys. So I just wanted to come back to this kind of general topic of we're adding $1.5 billion of GMV to the full year guide, but we're basically not changing revenue-less transaction expense. I know you're talking about the interest-bearing loans and kind of the revenue recognition dynamics there. I mean how long is that lag typically? I mean, I think this is a dynamic that's kind of throwing people off a bit? And how much of this sort of dynamic is due to Amazon?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. So the Amazon is part of it. But while the growth rate in Amazon -- well the addition of Amazon is great for us. As we communicated, we still doubled GMV excluding Amazon. And so, -- we know there's a lot of growth happening across the whole portfolio. So it's not just limited to Amazon. But the interest-bearing portfolio is growing quite quickly. And that does tend to have that effect that you talked about. The other obvious impact with respect to the revenue-less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV is the mix towards, Split Pay, again, as it does run lower. Again, it's a repeated theme with us but product mix really does shake out with respect to the take rates on both revenue and the revenue less transaction costs. And again, I think the only other thing to repeat is, we feel like we're operating at the higher end of the range that we've given folks in that 3% to 4% range and have a lot of confidence again in our long-term unit economics here. And again, would put ourselves up against anybody in our space with respect to the rates at which we're delivering here.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And then, I guess just for the back half of the year, how should we be thinking about GMV growth excluding Peloton? Like, has your full year expectation on telecom changed at all just given some of the challenges that they're having?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. Our current guidance reflects all of our current thinking on where they're at. We had frankly a good quarter in Q2 above our internal expectations. And feel like they're still delivering an incredible amount of volume for us. And we admire their brand. And we admire the loyalty that they have amongst their consumers. And we'll keep partnering with them. We launched with them in Australia this past quarter. And we're going to keep helping them grow their business.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Yes. I appreciate you taking the question. Maybe as it relates to Shopify, I'm still trying to sort of reconcile James' question a little bit too. I think you said, it will be 15% to 20% Split Pay will be about 15% to 20% of GMV this year. I guess, the first question would be, where do you think that can go? It's a pretty quick ramp, although, not totally out of line with our expectations. And then, the follow-up would be, it kind of implies based on your guidance that the rest of the business is growing about 45% volume-wise, which might be a little bit lower than we might have thought. Can you just address those two points? \nMax Levchin: I'll start and I'll let Michael finish. And so, I don't think we'll break out exactly what percentage of Shopify Split Pay performance is. But -- it's obviously growing very well. The merchant adoption has been excellent. And yet, there's no shortage of demand. And so I'm confident it can go up more. I don't think we're breaking that out in our guidance or Michael can correct me if I'm wrong here. But there's an enormous amount of growth there. Just if you take a quick look at Shop Pay, shopping installments doesn't even support interest-bearing loans today. But that alone, as a headline, should give you a pretty good idea that the service has been scratched with not a lot more.\nMichael Linford: Yes. And so, 15% to 20% is a good number, how big could it be? It could be very big. Just like we have a launch of interest-bearing on Shopify. We haven't launched Split Pay with either of our two largest enterprise merchants. So I have a lot of confidence that that number can continue to go out. I think the only other point with respect to the rest of the portfolio growth is just, we are up against continued elevated levels in our, call it, a long-term zero finance business. And we would continue to expect some of that to be a drag on the balance of the portfolio, but not something that we're trying to again target a Q3 growth number. We're thinking about how this network scales and then how those network effects show up with repeat usage across the whole portfolio.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. All right. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with SMBC Nikko Securities America. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Bauch: Hey, guys. I wanted to ask a question about the CFPB look at buy-now-pay-later. And from whatever you can share, is there anything you've garnered from those initial discussions that kind of give us a sense of how they're looking at the offering going forward?\nMax Levchin: Sure. First of all, it's obviously not for us to comment on their work there. The thing that's been true for us over the last 10 years is that we have a very, very high moral ground approach to this entire business, to the way we conduct ourselves, to the way we treat consumers, the way we deal with disputes, et cetera et cetera. And so, openings kept equal. We've been at the forefront of the industry suggesting to the regulators that they should have a look and a set of clear rules and just a good guidance around the contact of all the players. And so in that sense, it's a positive news. That's -- a regulatory relationship is both a very important things a very serious thing. We're interacting with them. There's a fairly detailed request for information. Obviously, we will reply to that. But all this compel think regulatory attention to the space is great. I was a little bit glib, when I pointed out that in a public record of the information demand, there was quite a lot of space dedicated to asking for the information around fees charged the late fees or deferred interest or sort of other things. And we fill that out with zeros because we don't charge any of those things to consumers took a small amount of pride in that we stuck to our mission, and stuck to our approach to treating consumers right. That said, I'm confident over time, there will be more regulatory attention and we will comply with all the necessary rules and we'll do well there. So too early to tell what the future looks like. It's certainly, fit to determine but we're very happy to engage. \nAndrew Bauch: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. My follow-up would be is there any kind of guidepost that you're going to give us from a macro perspective what you're embedding in the outlook for unemployment, inflation and rates. And I appreciate the color on the interest rate moves to the impact of the model, but just kind of thinking about what a baseline number that you're embedding in your assumption would be? \nMax Levchin: Yes. So, Sorry, I'll just now I get to last one was yours. But -- so -- and I'm sure we'll have macro views as well. But just the thing that I think people really misunderstand about our products maybe because it is more popular outside of high finance perhaps, when the interest rates go up and the prices go really when prices go up our product is more useful. If you try to make ends meet and you're trying to pay for a couch and your credit card is confusing you and the rates just went up and Affirm gives you clarity, and a way to pay for things in a clear schedule and then you're done and there are no late fees. And half the time plus or minus the seller will sponsor any pain new interest. Just are the basic experiments. If the card rate that you paid gone up 5% for example how do you feel about the 0% rate that a seller at a homeware shop is offering you powered Affirm like it's 5% more compelling. And so as inflation happens, the product that we provide is actually more powerful and more useful significantly better bearing sort of consumer demand side of it. On the flipside of course, the government addresses inflation raises rates et cetera. I'll stop now and Michael, can tell you what we've done about it but what things get equal at that top line this is generally a tailwind not a headwind. \nAndrew Bauch: Got it. Appreciate it, guys.\nMax Levchin: Michael?\nMichael Linford: Yes. Just the total avoidance of doubt, all of our outlook reflects the forward curve. And so there's roughly 180 basis points of rate increases. We take that into all of our models when we give guidance. It's consistent with the market expectation of rate movement. And so we talk about rising rates. That's not a problem for us at all. That's already reflected in the guidance.\nAndrew Bauch: Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two clarifications, I guess, just because it's come up a few times. But the implied revenue transaction cost take rate when you gave guidance for Q2 was almost about 5%. And so I think, one of the surprises was that came in at 4.1%. So -- and you talked about mix. So was that just that you didn't realize that the shop pay business was going to grow that much and it had that much of a factor on it. Just trying to make sure the guidance versus the actual. \nMichael Linford: Yes, that's right. The mix impact of the business the growth that we saw which was obviously well in excess of the guidance that we had given in the quarter tended to mix towards either lower revenue transaction costs take rates as a percentage of the total or tend to be a little bit more back-end weighted. And both those two effects caused the percent to go down, despite the fact that we did of course beat the guidance on a dollar basis. \nBryan Keane: Got it. And then the follow-up question we get often is the profitability on those larger contracts like in Amazon or Shop Pay. How do we think about that? Because those -- obviously those terms are with some larger merchants typically in merchant acquiring the larger merchants push pricing the hardest. And so really all pricing is made on SMB. So just trying to think about that relationship? Thanks so much.\nMichael Linford: Yes. If you look at the merchant take rate slide again in the supplement, you'll see that we're doing quite well on the Split Pay business with respect to our ability to continue to earn good fees. We're not breaking out profitability by a partner. But I think a key part of the reason we were able to deliver these exceptional enterprise experiences to the largest merchants is the fact that we're not just reliant on merchant fees. The fact that we do have consumer interest in the economic model does allow us to get to the merchant fee clearing rates that work for largest enterprises while still delivering  really strong unit economics. \nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks for the clarification.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. \nDan Dolev: Hey, thank you for taking my question. I just have a question regarding kind of where you are in terms of GMV and what's implied in the guidance? I'm still trying to get my head around the massive beat in the quarter. And then you seem to be guiding kind of in terms of a sequential basis so much lower GMV. I just want to make sure that this is hopefully a sign of conservatism and that there's the question we're getting a lot from investors this evening, is that there's maybe something else that got weaker. So we just want to reassure ourselves and investors that this is simply being conservative given the strong results?\nMax Levchin: First of all, I think Michael already mentioned this the seasonality is a significant component of this business. And so that's an important piece of the puzzle. I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about, in terms of something that may have gotten weaker not from our point of view. I think we've done fine and not anticipating weakness. But we try to make sure that we promise and deliver as opposed to promise and older and see what happens. That's probably a philosophical approach to guys that we out there. \nDan Dolev: Got it. Yes. Sorry I didn't mean to sort of harp on it. If I look at sort of pre-COVID kind of trends on a GMV basis it doesn't look like at least like Q3, Q4 weaker. That's why I asked the question but... \nMax Levchin: Again, in kind of all honesty the quarter we just exited just an absolutely monster. And so, no matter what you sort of say for the next one it will look like well not what happened here. But our transaction volume. I'm going to remember here, so I may be wrong Michael, correct me, but I think we've tripled year-on-year of Black Friday Cyber Monday transaction count. That should -- we haven't tripled any metric of that class series or CCC company. And so the growth of GMV and transactions accelerated quite a lot. We'll digest and grow some more.\nDan Dolev: Appreciate. Thank you so much guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Caintic: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. And thanks for all the details on the credit trends, all the slides there. I just wanted to follow up on that. I guess there's this concern about credit normalization and how it impacts the business, if at all. And so looking at the slides, the delinquencies still below 2019, but getting there the net charge-off as well. Just wondering as you're thinking, if credit is normalizing, how does that impact the business? And if you can describe some of the offsets that you mentioned earlier like the optimization, the merchant pricing and so on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: I'll start and let Michael chime in as well. So I'll never tired of repeating it, but we choose the delinquency number we post module compensating or a completely unexpected events. Our job/goal/approach is to drive to a number that we like here. And we feel that we were probably retrospectively unnecessarily careful or necessarily tight for lack of a better term. And then so, we've loosened quite deliberately. And as you noted, we've also -- or someone else actually already noticed that we have now gotten to roughly the range that we like and we'll continue managing the number. And so in that sense, there are inevitably ups and downs in consumer behavior, as stimulus winding up and all the other versions of microconomic events impacting the business. But we have an enormous number of transactions sort of -- think of it as a curve that's differential at every point basically infinite number derivatives, but it's a high number of derivatives in terms of ability to differentiate, which means at any given time we have control both at a product level and the consumer level and also not being a line of credit allows us to differentiate a specific point of purchase to the type of transaction. And so we'll continue driving to the outcomes that we need we want for our margin and our numbers. And the macroeconomic realities are things are related with sheets our willingness to sort of bet into the gray zone. And as we read the macroeconomic numbers, we'll become less or more willing to -- I'll allow into the system. But it's something that is a choice in essence, it's always hard for me to react to what is the macroconomic -- what is the wider consumer trend doing. There's a lot more demand for our product than we are approving in many cases because it's just bad idea for a particular consumer to borrow certainly borrow from us given our loss of guardrails no late fees et cetera. So in that sense the demand for product significantly outstrips our willingness to take the risk and we'll continue managing sort of the right product there.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. Great. Thank you. I mean I guess following up on that your -- so it's -- you have credit -- the credit variables as an input of your decision making. I mean I guess, if there is kind of a macro credit issue, is that doesn't sound like it's really going to impact volumes or merchant pricing that should stay the same because your product becomes more valuable in that situation, or maybe if you could talk about I don't know like the inputs and outputs there? \nMax Levchin: So, I'll tell you a little bit of a color generating anecdotes. In the early days of the pandemic we actually went to our merchants and said look we believe the macroeconomic conditions are going to worsen before they get better. We don't really know there's a lot of uncertainty. For those of you who are very focused on the bottom-line, we are going to adjust credits which means that approvals will go down a little bit. We're dealing on the margin here so this is points up or down. But for those focused on the topline and it all depends on the margin embedded in the merchant's product, right? And some people manufacture their own others resell something they buy and resell it. Again -- but the margin content that they have is usable to increase our approval and allow us to be in the ability to repay sort of gray zone where the model say ability is not 100%. And we generally speaking we're able to command a significantly -- significant price increases at the merchant base during the early days of the pandemic because the products that we provide to the consumer in the moments of uncertainty is just so powerful. And so -- yes, generally speaking, I mean there's lots of to add there. And macroeconomic issues can be described as all kinds of things. But as the economy ebbs and flows if consumers need more access to credit many, many, many of our partners are very happy to pay more for that consumers to complete transactions because the certainty and sense of control that we provide is what helps them move merchandise off the shelves. And so in essence, it's a little glib, but macroeconomic uncertainty is actually a driver of business like ours. If everybody was just swimming in government stimulus money maybe just buy everything for cash. And so the discontinuation of various stimuli is on net a positive driver for the business both on the consumer demand side and the merchants' willingness to pay for our services.\nVincent Caintic: Okay, perfect. That\u2019s very helpful commentary. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Brendler: Hi thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I will start a little bit more boring on the expense side. Pretty big sequential increases in all the non-GAAP expenses technology sales and marketing. I just wanted to get a sense is that related to some of the ramp-up in some of these partnerships, or should we think about expense growth as a run rate? And obviously, I know you have the operating income guidance out there for the near-term, but just thinking about expense growth slow -- and maybe give a characteristic of some of the expense growth would be great as well. Thanks.\nMichael Linford: Yes. Characteristic is mostly human capital combined with marketing investments on the non-GAAP side. On the GAAP side, there's also the impact associated with stock-based compensation, D&A, and the other non-cash items. I think we will stand by our long-term guidance that we gave in September around the profitability of the business being a function of the growth rate. So, while we're growing like this, we are going to keep investing in that human capital to build great products and delight consumers. And when and if that growth rate ever starts to slow down, you'll see us grow expenses much slower and begin to deliver positive adjusted operating income. I think of the profitability or bottom-line measures that we really manage to, the adjusted operating income number is what we intend to hit. It's where we have the guidance out for you for this period and that's the number that we think will become scaling up and down as growth rates change. \nChris Brendler: Okay. Thank you. And I guess another boring question Michael is the just the health of the debt markets I know you continue to use securitization both on and off balance sheet. It looks like you sold some more whole loans this quarter. Balance sheet growth actually came in a little bit below our estimates. Just is it still as healthy as it was given your increasing traction among fixed income investors, or has there been a bit of pullback given the macro conditions?\nMichael Linford: No, I think we still continue to have very well-received deals in the market both single counterparty deals and our forward flow relationships. As I mentioned in the script, we had a great deal of capacity by adding new partners and upsizing existing ones. And we still continue to receive a lot of demand for the assets. And our securitization activity has also been very successful. And you're going to see us continue to be very, very active there in both of those two markets and levers to continue to grow our business and deliver we think again excellent capital efficiency.\nChris Brendler: Great. Congrats on the results as well. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. This also concludes our call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Hello, and thank you for joining us on this earnings call. Affirm is just a handful of days away from its tenth anniversary and this earnings report also marks the first anniversary of our public debut. While the road ahead of us is significantly longer than the one we've traveled so far, the occasion does warrant a moment of reflection on the execution of our strategy during the last 12 months. We feel great about our progress. We remain quite unpivoted and focused on delivering long-term compounding value to all our stakeholders, consumers, merchants, employees and shareholders. As we introduced ourselves to the public markets a year ago we talked about several key themes. First and foremost is our mission, which is to deliver honest financial products to improve lives and to do so while delighting the people we get to serve every day. Because the opportunity embedded in our mission is still so vast and open consumer growth is very important to Affirm. We've done very well. Indeed our active consumer growth accelerated growing by 150% to provide well north of 11 million people with a smarter way to pay. Growth for us is never just about getting the next million consumers. It's also about the impact we can have on the financial well-being of the folks who rely on Affirm. I\u2019ve also talked about our other all important constituent, the merchant. Affirm is as much a safe and transparent pay-over-time option for the buyer, as it is the ultimate marketing tool for the seller. We help our partners drive meaningful incremental sales without needing to resort to gimmicks or discounting. The number of active merchants on our platform is another key measure for Affirm and over the last year, we've significantly expanded our reach. There too, we accelerated with a more than 20x increase from a year ago and a 64% increase from the rolling 12-month tally we reported just 90 days ago. As a company founded by engineers, we focused early on investing heavily in technology, scalable enough to economically support the smallest of businesses all the way up to the world's largest retailers. We've continued this policy of investment and development in pursuit of technological competitive superiority. The strategy is working and delivering results. In fact, our technology is what has enabled us to work with tech savvy giants, such as Walmart, Shopify, Amazon and Target. We estimate that this year, Affirm processed 1.6% of all US outline transaction volume for the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period, another triple-digit increase from last year. Simultaneously, a momentous number and a signifier of just how early we are in this market. Even a decade in the ramp-up to the holiday shopping rush is an intense yet exhilarating exercise in scalability preparedness. Each year's Black Friday weekend brings by far the greatest number of concurrent transactions we've ever experienced. I'm very proud of our engineering teams for delivering another flawlessly executed record-breaking Black Friday weekend, and I'm also grateful to our friends at Shopify engineering, who had lent some of their technical expertise to us as we prepped in the days before. It is an off-treated outage that product innovation slows down, as companies go public. I'm pleased to report that we were able to accelerate our product delivery since the IPO. We've rolled out cash back rewards for participating merchants, delivered the unique adaptive checkout, launched the Affirm SuperApp and the Affirm Chrome extension and introduced the beta version of super simple consumer-friendly crypto savings. You may have noted the announcement of Visa being the launch partner for Debit+ which is now in the initial waitlist rollout. Though I will continue to caution you to not yet give crazy forecasting this product's impact on our P&L at scale, I do have fun insight to share. On average, the number of weekly transactions by Debit+ consumer, excluding our own employees is greater than an order of magnitude above that of a regular Affirm user. Of course, these are enthusiastic early adopters and we fully expect the number to normalize, but it's exciting to see first glimpses of what Affirm as a daily instrument might look like. We remain very excited about the future of this product, and expect to talk a lot more about it this year. We had said last year that BNPL is an international phenomenon and we intend to bring Affirm's unique no late fees, no grudges, no regress approach well beyond our home borders. Over the last 12 months, we've solidified our industry leadership with PayBright by Affirm in Canada and launched in Australia our first non-North American market, and the growth of our business continues to accelerate. Affirm had more than 16,000 active merchants on the platform as of the end of calendar 2021, largely thanks to our partnerships with online commerce platforms. In aggregate, Affirm is now present on sites that account for more than half of all US e-commerce and that number continues to march higher every day. In our second quarter, year-over-year GMV growth accelerated to 115% from 84% in the first fiscal quarter. Moving beyond the testing phase of our collaboration with Amazon before the holidays was a significant driver of this growth. However, if you exclude Amazon, our GMV still doubled year-over-year. We are highly cognizant of the fact that over 80% of commerce is still conducted offline. Our recently announced partnerships with Verifone and Adient are just two of the numerous investments we're making with our partners to bring honest financial products to consumers at the physical point-of-sale. We're also expanding the ability to use Affirm in-store with our own products like Debit+. Our focus on using exceptional technology to drive growth and improve efficiency has been a winning strategy for Affirm, and we never stopped finding ways to optimize and deliver even more value. This shows up in our results in a number of ways from new partnerships to long-standing relationships. For example, iterating over the last three years, our relationship with Walmart has grown, as we prove the value of our products. We expect similarly great things from our other major partnerships with time. As we develop with and learn from each customer, we are excited to bring these learnings and the products they engender to all merchants big and small. The strength of our network is measured in merchant coverage and repeat consumer engagement both of which are rising rapidly. We grew total transactions by 218% and transactions per active user by 15% year-over-year even as we added a tremendous number of new consumers. Our momentum is strengthening. Our strategy is working and we are extending our lead. We intend to double down on the three key things that got us here: One, deliver unique and delightful financial products that align fully with our mission; Two continue to be the partner of choice for merchants that care about intelligent growth scalability and reliability; and three deepen our underwriting advantage. Speaking of underwriting. We manage risk, though we are an easy-to-understand tool to maximize one's personal capital and the retail marketers, best friend. At our core Affirm is ultimately a risk managing business. We facilitate the transaction settle with the merchant soon thereafter and bill the buyer over a predetermined period of time.  But wait there's more. When we charge interest which we don't always do, we don't compound it into principal. Moreover, we don't compound interest after it reaches the amount we communicated to the consumer at purchase time. We refine interest when the buyer prepays. We don't even charge late fees. These are all deliberate choices made in the first few days of our company's life. We meant to align ourselves with our consumers in this manner avoiding the moral hazard of capitalizing on their mistakes for revenue opportunities. These decisions are as on mission and moral as they are self-serving. These policies are an important part of why our consumer satisfaction is so high and we only wanted to go up. With the self-imposed guardrails exceptional underwriting and risk management frameworks are a requirement. That's why we underwrite every transaction before making a credit decision unlike some of our competitors in the BNPL space who readily admit they do no underwriting at all. It is also important to understand that unlike many players in our industry we do not treat delinquencies or defaults as an outcome of our business decisions. Indeed, we choose acceptable delinquency rates as an input into our decision-making, based on the pricing our products command with our customers, our view of the macroeconomic conditions and the demand for our loan volume in the capital markets. This distinction may seem subtle, but I think it really helps understand our approach to risk. We spent the last decade building what we believe to be one of the best-in-class credit underwriting ecosystems. Data, tools processes and teams that deliver underwriting models with some of the very best results in the industry. Today I'll pull the curtain back a little and while I will keep it very high level in part to avoid giving out trade secrets feel free to tune out for a few minutes while I nerd out. Affirm's underwriting advantage begins before any of our models are interrogated for a decision with our product design. Because Affirm is predominantly offered at the point of sale, we have a natural opportunity to explain our value and transparent approach to the consumer. As a result, we avoid much of the adverse selection that often comes with traditional lending. Coupled with the SKU level data we receive from our partners our models tend to split the risk far better than those used in traditional consumer loans. Another fundamental structural advantage Affirm has, is its total separability of transactions. Unlike providers of lines of credit, we underwrite transactions individually modeling a consumer's ability to pay us back, as well as their propensity to do so. This notion of separability is also recursive a consequence of our product because repayment schedules are highly predictable our models operate at an individual installment level. This separability is a powerful tool for modeling as well as managing risk. We're able to deliver a reliable forward-looking picture of both consumers and our own cash flow. Our proprietary network of directly integrated merchants as well as other sources of non-traditional underwriting data offers us a significant raw data advantage into feature engineering. We maintain a library of over 500 features that we select from as we create new models or update existing ones, while continuously looking for and eliminating any potential for disparate impact in our decisioning both at individual variable and model levels. We train our models using academically well-understood and boosting technique with significant proprietary modifications we've invented that help us improve results. Because from the very beginning, we focused equally on consumer and merchant information, we ended up with a large number of models that are specific to our products and merchants who use them. Moreover, as we launch new products with new and existing partners, we acquire new types of data that we incorporate into the models and over time give incremental weight too. Underwriting models decay over time, as macroeconomic conditions and consumer behaviors change. Even the very best performing ones can loose a few percentage points of their area under the curve every few months. Over the years, we've built special-purpose models that track model decay, the machine learning equivalent of a canary in the coal mine. Our proprietary software and processes allow us to rapidly retrain, retest and redeploy models where the performance has deteriorated in a matter of days. To illustrate this, let's take a side-by-side look at ITACS, one of our longest-serving proprietary models versus a traditional credit scoring system like FICO. Using ITACS reducing originations by 10% would eliminate one-third of all delinquencies in dollars, while using the traditional credit scoring system would only reduce delinquencies by a mere 13%. Let's take it a step further. If we were to reduce originations by 30% using ITACS, we would remove 70% of all delinquencies, while the traditional score would only catch 36%. So needless to say, this model slopes a lot better than the traditional industry standard. These achievements may sound quite abstract, but they have a very real impact with our superior underwriting capabilities. Affirm can approve many more college students buying tickets to see family after months of pandemic isolation and young parents picking up their first stroller. And because Affirm's average loan duration at origination by design is very short, at just 5.2 months, the exceptional precision and recall of our credit models give us great confidence that our portfolio both retained and sold will continue to perform well in the future. Any use of advanced technology has both advantages and risks associated with it. As we push our model performance further in pursuit of expanding our offerings, we work just as diligently on ensuring that our models are both compliant with all applicable laws and rules and that our model decisions are both reasonable and are understandable by consumers. We regularly audit our models to avoid correlation with prohibited basis and have them audited externally. We also invest heavily in explainability of model outcomes, so that both consumers and regulators can understand our decisions quite easily. None of this of course would exist without the extraordinary team of people that make it all possible. I am truly fortunate to have been able to start this company with a group of brilliant minds, who in turn attracted more and more talented folks to join our mission and bring their mathematical and other talents to bear. It is this embarrassment of riches among my teammates that makes me so optimistic about the next decade of Affirm. Large as some of these numbers might be, Affirm still accounts for around 1% of US e-commerce and both consumers and merchants are genuinely excited to get more value from Affirm. And we are excited to deliver it. As usual I want to thank my team for all their amazing work. And even during some pretty volatile moments for our stock price for staying truly focused on the long-term value creation for all our stakeholders and on our mission. Now on to Michael for the numbers. Yes. There is a potential. I was just starting to fall asleep, because you guys are asking Michael excellent questions, and he's doing a great job answering -- the sorry -- the longer it is it's exactly right. The way I think and it goes back many years now, the way we look at our transactional economics is in credit dimensions one is of course lifetime consumer kind of managing credit side of it. But if you -- on the ROA basis, you have to look at the charge-offs that you incur -- and once you -- Michael touched this really well and it's kind of a whole lot of my script, but basically we manage it to a number. We decide what that's going to be and we drive that to eight basis points that we like per product, per merchant, et cetera. After you're done with that you look at your other costs and servicing is the one where we're always really hesitant to mess too much, because you want the consumer experience to be amazing. And obviously, over time we'll optimize that to a perfect number for the sort of, the high-touch wide webservices have created is really, really valuable to us. We're completely ruthless on the rest of it. The repayment cost is something that just screams 80 basis points away. And you're totally right there's lots and lots of opportunity. The repayment devices or vehicles are not all created equal. There's some really interesting innovation happening even sort of beyond ACH which is currently kind of the most popular flash cheapest one. And so we will absolutely do a lot of things there. It is more important in this whole story of this quarter we're reporting and going forward we're still taking enormous amounts of white space. The growth of the network is what we are grading ourselves on right now. We are paying attention to cost at scale be real dollars and we'll invest in a reduction of these costs involved. And we guessed pretty well where opportunities are. Just one more one more way of thinking about it that I guess utilize. And fundamentally just from going back to my experience odd years ago, pricing power of a payments network is directly proportionate to the number of active users it has. Like ultimately, when you come to market and say I have a product and I would like you to buy my way of delivering tender, the price that product is able to command is inevitably a function of how many people are using that product, prefer it, would like to use that to check out, whatever we want to call it. And so the reason we are so consumer growth and coverage obsessed isn't for some sort of a vanity number but the fact that ultimately we intend to come to market and say, we are the largest network. We are the most active network. We would like you to pay for that appropriately. And so this growth is a direct tie to the path to profitability. I'll start and I'll let Michael finish. And so, I don't think we'll break out exactly what percentage of Shopify Split Pay performance is. But -- it's obviously growing very well. The merchant adoption has been excellent. And yet, there's no shortage of demand. And so I'm confident it can go up more. I don't think we're breaking that out in our guidance or Michael can correct me if I'm wrong here. But there's an enormous amount of growth there. Just if you take a quick look at Shop Pay, shopping installments doesn't even support interest-bearing loans today. But that alone, as a headline, should give you a pretty good idea that the service has been scratched with not a lot more. Sure. First of all, it's obviously not for us to comment on their work there. The thing that's been true for us over the last 10 years is that we have a very, very high moral ground approach to this entire business, to the way we conduct ourselves, to the way we treat consumers, the way we deal with disputes, et cetera et cetera. And so, openings kept equal. We've been at the forefront of the industry suggesting to the regulators that they should have a look and a set of clear rules and just a good guidance around the contact of all the players. And so in that sense, it's a positive news. That's -- a regulatory relationship is both a very important things a very serious thing. We're interacting with them. There's a fairly detailed request for information. Obviously, we will reply to that. But all this compel think regulatory attention to the space is great. I was a little bit glib, when I pointed out that in a public record of the information demand, there was quite a lot of space dedicated to asking for the information around fees charged the late fees or deferred interest or sort of other things. And we fill that out with zeros because we don't charge any of those things to consumers took a small amount of pride in that we stuck to our mission, and stuck to our approach to treating consumers right. That said, I'm confident over time, there will be more regulatory attention and we will comply with all the necessary rules and we'll do well there. So too early to tell what the future looks like. It's certainly, fit to determine but we're very happy to engage. Yes. So, Sorry, I'll just now I get to last one was yours. But -- so -- and I'm sure we'll have macro views as well. But just the thing that I think people really misunderstand about our products maybe because it is more popular outside of high finance perhaps, when the interest rates go up and the prices go really when prices go up our product is more useful. If you try to make ends meet and you're trying to pay for a couch and your credit card is confusing you and the rates just went up and Affirm gives you clarity, and a way to pay for things in a clear schedule and then you're done and there are no late fees. And half the time plus or minus the seller will sponsor any pain new interest. Just are the basic experiments. If the card rate that you paid gone up 5% for example how do you feel about the 0% rate that a seller at a homeware shop is offering you powered Affirm like it's 5% more compelling. And so as inflation happens, the product that we provide is actually more powerful and more useful significantly better bearing sort of consumer demand side of it. On the flipside of course, the government addresses inflation raises rates et cetera. I'll stop now and Michael, can tell you what we've done about it but what things get equal at that top line this is generally a tailwind not a headwind. Michael? First of all, I think Michael already mentioned this the seasonality is a significant component of this business. And so that's an important piece of the puzzle. I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about, in terms of something that may have gotten weaker not from our point of view. I think we've done fine and not anticipating weakness. But we try to make sure that we promise and deliver as opposed to promise and older and see what happens. That's probably a philosophical approach to guys that we out there. Again, in kind of all honesty the quarter we just exited just an absolutely monster. And so, no matter what you sort of say for the next one it will look like well not what happened here. But our transaction volume. I'm going to remember here, so I may be wrong Michael, correct me, but I think we've tripled year-on-year of Black Friday Cyber Monday transaction count. That should -- we haven't tripled any metric of that class series or CCC company. And so the growth of GMV and transactions accelerated quite a lot. We'll digest and grow some more. I'll start and let Michael chime in as well. So I'll never tired of repeating it, but we choose the delinquency number we post module compensating or a completely unexpected events. Our job/goal/approach is to drive to a number that we like here. And we feel that we were probably retrospectively unnecessarily careful or necessarily tight for lack of a better term. And then so, we've loosened quite deliberately. And as you noted, we've also -- or someone else actually already noticed that we have now gotten to roughly the range that we like and we'll continue managing the number. And so in that sense, there are inevitably ups and downs in consumer behavior, as stimulus winding up and all the other versions of microconomic events impacting the business. But we have an enormous number of transactions sort of -- think of it as a curve that's differential at every point basically infinite number derivatives, but it's a high number of derivatives in terms of ability to differentiate, which means at any given time we have control both at a product level and the consumer level and also not being a line of credit allows us to differentiate a specific point of purchase to the type of transaction.

So in that sense the demand for product significantly outstrips our willingness to take the risk and we'll continue managing sort of the right product there. So, I'll tell you a little bit of a color generating anecdotes.

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Thanks, Max and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrated a massive step change in our network scale driven by our partnership with the largest enterprises and our technology advantage. Growth accelerated on both sides of our network as active consumers more than doubled, while active merchants increased more than 20 times. Frequency increased alongside that explosive user growth. Total transactions grew 218%, the fastest rate since our Series D private funding round. We grew GMV 115% in revenue by 77%. In November, we completed the rollout of our initial offering at Amazon in the United States. And even excluding Amazon's contribution we significantly exceeded our outlook for both GMV and revenue. Unit economics were also strong. Revenue less transaction costs grew faster than revenue at 93% from the prior year. And even as we accelerated network growth, we continue to operate with efficiency reducing the equity capital we used to fund our loans by 17% versus last year. With the accelerating growth of our business and the early traction with our enterprise partners, we are raising our outlook for fiscal year 2022, which I'll share more about in a moment. Before I do that let's walk through the second quarter results. Unless stated otherwise all comparisons refer to our second fiscal quarter of 2022 versus Q2 of fiscal 2021. We had another great quarter for consumer growth. Active consumers increased 150% to 11.2 million and increased 2.5 million sequentially from fiscal Q1. Despite adding users at this aggressive pace we grew transactions per active consumer by 15% year-to-year and more than tripled the number of transactions. More merchants, platforms and brands are leveraging the power of Affirm to grow their businesses. In the second quarter active merchants grew to more than 168,000 from just 8,000 last year thanks in large part to the scaling of our partnership with Shopify. On a sequential basis active merchants which we calculate over a trailing 12-month time frame grew 64% from the September ending quarter. Turning to GMV. We grew GMV to $4.5 billion in our second quarter a $2.4 billion increase from last year. The 115% increase includes the volume from our partnership with Amazon. We completed the launch of our interest-bearing program at Amazon in November ahead of Black Friday. And while the program is still in its infancy with a long road map of optimizations to work on we've seen rapid consumer adoption. We look forward to years of growth in this collaboration. We have strong momentum across our business. Excluding Amazon GMV doubled with growth across all products and verticals. We I would also note that our business with Peloton our second largest merchant partner by GMV in the quarter was up against an unusually strong prior year comp following the launch of a new product slate and boosted by COVA tailwinds. As a testament to the increasing depth and breadth of our network no single merchant accounted for more than 10% of Q2 GMV. One year ago we discussed how we would expand into higher frequency purchase areas and diversify our merchant partnerships. A year later I'm really proud of how our team has delivered on these objectives for our shareholders. the industry vertical. We have phenomenal holiday season. We more than doubled our volume from Black Friday Cyber Monday, and we believe we took significant market share from both traditional incumbents and BNPL pure plays. As Max shared, we estimate that Affirm facilitated 1.6% of total online transaction volume for the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period in the US, and we saw particular strength in key holiday categories in Q2. Travel and ticketing increased, up 314% from last year, topping last quarter's high mark even despite the emergence of the Omicron variant. General merchandise grew 368% above last year, driven by our deepening partnership with the industry's leading retailers and the launch of our offering at Amazon in the US. Consumer electronics, which grew 209% year-to-year was another great story driven by strong demand for TVs, laptops and gaming consoles. Our results this holiday season highered our ability to take share and grow in any environment. And importantly, why we're so different from the composition. Outside the US, we had another outstanding quarter. Our Canadian business more than tripled in size, thanks to existing and new partnerships, including Apple which launched in the fall to brisk consumer demand. In the second quarter, we also entered the Australian market with Peloton, and look forward to growing our business with them there. This quarter, our interest-bearing program which includes our initial offering at Amazon grew significantly up 124% year-on-year to $1.4 billion. Before, I jump into the financials, let me walk through the mechanics of this offering to illustrate the impact on the income statement. On the revenue side, we monetize these loans by either holding them to maturity or selling them to third parties. When we hold the loans, we primarily earn interest income, which we recognize over the duration of the loan. Hence, this quarter's revenue reflects just a portion of the total yield we will ultimately see from the GMV, we generated in Q2. We will recognize the balance over the subsequent quarters. As an illustrative data point, we sold 59% of the interest-bearing loans generated in the US this quarter, and retained the remainder. On the expense side, we provision for credit losses upfront for loans we hold this means that the margin profile is back-end weighted. Our partnerships with key enterprise merchants are unlocking more opportunities for our business every day and we are investing today to realize the full long-term potential. While we are just in the beginning stages in scaling these partnerships, we are already seeing them drive network expansion and we expect to deliver strong unit economics when they reach scale. Now turning to the financials, the strong GMV growth also drove strong revenue growth. Net revenue grew 77% to $361 million, well above our outlook. Total network revenue grew 39%, while interest income increased 87% and gain on loan sale rose four-fold. Revenue as a percentage of GMV contracted 170 basis points to 8% driven by product mix. Split Pay grew over four times year-on-year, and accounted for more than 20% of GMV in the second quarter from just 11% last year. In our earnings supplement posted to our Investor Relations website you will see that merchant revenue take rates have remained relatively constant for each of our offerings. On the expense side, we continue to grow revenue faster than transaction costs delivering real leverage. Total transaction costs of $177 million grew 63% year-over-year compared to revenue growth of 77%. And excluding provision for credit losses, transaction cost as a percentage of GMV declined 190 basis points to 2.8%. Given the mix shift from longer duration 0% APR loans, loss on loan purchase commitments declined 4%, while improvements in our capital programs helped limit the growth of funding cost to 47%. Provision for credit losses grew for $13 million when a year ago to $53 million as the year ago figure included a $39 million release of excess COVID-related loan allowance, while this year's figure reflects the intentional normalization of credit that we've discussed over the past several quarters. Over the first half of the fiscal year, we have managed delinquencies of 30 days or more to remain below the same periods of fiscal 2019 and 2020, even as we have expanded the credit box to a more normalized level compared to the early days of pandemic. Our strong top line growth and leverage we achieved on transaction costs drove a 93% increase in revenue less transaction costs to $184 million, above our outlook range or 4.1% of GMV. Looking at OpEx beyond transaction costs. We continue to invest in building our team and elevating our brand. We doubled headcount to more than 2000 Affirmers and increased marketing around the holidays. Our teams have delivered a torrent of exciting new offerings. While our brand campaign drove greater awareness across all age cohorts and helped us reach the highest aided awareness among BNPL providers at 45%. Growing our team resulted in higher personnel costs and stock-based compensation. In Q2, total operating expenses, exclusive of transaction costs, grew $258 million, of which $158 million was related to D&A, stock-based compensation, foreign expense and one-time expenses related to our IPO and acquisitions. Excluding these items, non-transactional operating expenses grew 109%. On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $196 million, which compares to a loss of $27 million last year. Adjusted operating loss was $8 million in the quarter compared to a $3 million of income in the prior year. Now turning to our balance sheet. We fortified our cash position and delivered accelerating GMV growth while continuing to manage our capital with discipline and efficiency. In November, we issued $1.7 billion in zero coupon senior convertible notes with a five-year maturity, which has significantly increased the capital we have to invest in growth, at an extremely attractive long-term borrowing costs, while minimizing dilution. Our effective capital markets program and disciplined approach helped to reduce equity capital used to fund our business from $277 million last year to $230 million even as loans on the balance sheet grew by more than $500 million. As a percentage of total platform portfolio, equity capital required declined to 3.6% from 7.5% last year. Total platform portfolio grew 72% from $3.7 billion to $6.3 billion at the end and we increased our overall funding capacity in line from $4.7 billion last year to $8.8 billion. Over the past year, we brought on $1.9 billion in new loan buyer commitments from both new and existing capital partners. Our balance is held by third-party loan buyers from our forward flow program grew 129% to $3.7 billion while our securitization program grew 83%. Our health balances declined 24% as we continue to focus on more efficient funding vehicles. Before I move to our outlook, I want to touch on an important topic that has been top of mind for investors' interest rates. While potential interest rate hikes have dominated headlines, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow rapidly while delivering strong economics as rates rise. Our financial outlook already reflects a roughly 180 basis point increase embedded in the three-month LIBOR forward curve and our current long-term model which caused a revenue less transaction cost of 3% to 4% also assumes rate normalization. We have significant advantages to help us mitigate the impact of rising rates, including broad and diverse funding partnerships, that allow us to shift funding to less rate-sensitive counterparties, sophisticated underwriting and risk management infrastructure that allows us to manage unit economics with changes to our cost environment and high turnover short-term assets that make our portfolio inherently nimble and able to react quickly to changing market conditions. At a constant product and funding mix, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase beyond the increase implied by the current yield curve would only result in a 10 to 20 basis point impact to revenue-less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV for the remainder of fiscal year 2022. Looking out to fiscal 2023, we believe that a further 100 basis point rate increase, again beyond current expectations would only result in approximately 20 basis point impact to revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV based upon our current funding and GMV mix. And that is before we apply any of the numerous offsets we have including consumer and merchant pricing, funding strategies and credit optimizations. Looking beyond fiscal year 2023 at our current funding and product mix, we estimate the impact to revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of to be approximately 40 basis points for every 100 basis points of rate movement beyond the current forward curve. And again that\u2019s before applying any cost, credit and revenue optimization. Now turning to the outlook. Our business has never been stronger. And as we look through the remainder of our fiscal year, we are raising our financial outlook to reflect the robust second quarter results, accelerating momentum in the business and we are now including Amazon's expected contribution to the outlook. For fiscal year 2022, we now expect GMV to be between $14.58 billion and $14.78 billion, representing a 76% to 78% increase from fiscal year 2021. Given the strong traction we're seeing with Shopify, we now expect our Split Pay offering to comprise 15% to 20% of total GMV for the fiscal year. We expect revenue of $1.29 billion to $1.31 billion representing year-over-year growth of 48% to 50%. We expect transaction costs of $705 million to $715 million, resulting in revenue less transaction cost of $585 million to $595 million. This reflects the continued mix shift we are seeing in the business. We expect an adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 12% to 14% as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business and weighted average shares of approximately $285 million. Consistent with Max's remarks, Affirm does not assume a material impact from the rollout of Debit+. We also expect a very strong fiscal third quarter with GMV of $3.61 billion to $3.71 billion, total revenue of $325 million to $335 million; transaction costs of $187 million to $192 million and revenue less transaction costs of $138 million to $143 million. Adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 19% to 21% and weighted average shares outstanding of $290 million. In closing, we just posted an incredible quarter of great and our team is seizing this momentum to continue to deliver on our mission. I'd like to add my thanks to the great work of all Affirmer\u2019s this quarter. Max and I will now open the line for questions. Yes. I'll grab that one. And I think to start off, we're very happy with the pace of scaling in the network. The Q4 results, as you said were pretty spectacular -- sorry calendar Q4 results were pretty spectacular and it was indeed a special quarter. We are reiterating our guidance and taking it up. So, our outlook continues to improve for the balance of the fiscal year. And we're still well in excess of the high growth phase. We're in the hyper growth phase for the stock. And so we feel really good about the scaling that we're doing. Yes, there are impacts of seasonality. Calendar Q4 tends to be heavier with holiday shopping. As I shared in my remarks, we had a really strong holiday season. So there's a little bit of sequential impact there. And yes, the growth in interest-bearing will tend to create some back-endedness to both the revenue and margin profile of those originations. But again, I think we're very happy with the pace of which we're scaling and we're certainly not focused on or concerned with the next quarter. We're really looking about where this network will be over the next decade. Very good question. If you look at the chart that we have in the supplement, you can see the seasonality curve of delinquencies and there's actually quite a bit of seasonality tied to both the shopping seasons and the repayment schedules have happened. And we're back to a more normalized seasonality curve with respect to what you see in delinquencies. And to reiterate the point, I mean we're very happy with the credit outcomes we're driving right now. And we take a very intentional approach here and we have intentionally been losing the credit box over the past year. We're still below 2019 and 2020 numbers, fiscal 2019 and 2020 and feel really good about the level of delinquency in light of the total unit economics that we're driving. And the only other thing I'd add is that, we really do manage to a total portfolio number here. There's a bit of a misunderstanding we think out there with folks looking at not the portfolio delinquencies, but looking at one securitization vehicle or one particular slice of our business. We are very thoughtful about portfolio construction that goes into any one of our funding vehicles. And each one has a unique profile based upon market demand and our needs. For example, the split pay content may change. We made pledge loans that have sensor delinquency, et cetera. And so no one securitization, data set can really represent the portfolio and would really encourage everybody to look at our investor supplement to see a real view of portfolio-wide DQs. Yes. The last we have the least amount of control over that really is a function of the network interchange that we earn. And I think you nailed it. The line that you see on split pay merchant fee rates up versus Q1, we were promotional with Shopify in particular in Q1, but really up even year-on-year back to the fiscal Q2 in 2021. So, we feel really good about our resiliency with respect to the most competitive space, which is the split pay product set. The IB line that you point out is a function of the growth that we have in our largest enterprises, we would earn less there than we would everywhere else. And part of the reason we're so confident in how we're growing is those two things mix in our favor, where you've got a lot of growth in the split pay offering with really high merchant fees and you have a lot of user growth that comes along with that combined with these enterprise scale offerings that will drive tremendous processing volume as well as in the long run we think really strong economics. So, we feel really good about the mix really want investors to understand that when you average -- when you have the sort of major shifts in the mix in the portfolio, it will shake out differently in the income statement. Yes. We're not ready to give guidance for 2023. So I'll avoid that one. But I think the guide that you see and the results we just posted we talk a lot about the long-term economics of the business being somewhere between 3% and 4% on a revenue-less transaction cost basis. And we're on the higher end of that last quarter and inside the guidance for the back half of the year as well. While I think there -- it is changing quite quickly with respect to the product level economics. If you're taking on a Split Pay product with 5% to 5.5% merchant fees you're not going to be making four points of margin. And so you do expect a little bit of compression on a percentage of GMV basis on the Split Pay business. And yet the opposite is true on our interest-bearing business where we're able to earn even higher total revenue transaction costs but over time. And I think as we continue to scale some of our enterprise partnerships you're going to see some again back-endedness to the timing of those things. So our guidance reflects the mix that we expect over the next six months. And we'll update everybody with 2023 back when we talk later this year, but we're not at all concerned with our long-term guidance of staying in the 3% to 4% range, which we believe is still materially better than our competition. No. I mean Max's line in the setup today what I'd like to reiterate which is our strategy hasn't changed. We talked about the financial model and framework in September and that remains true, no matter the macro conditions changing. While we have the opportunity to grow at this pace with what we think are industry-leading unit economics, we're not going to take our foot off the gas and we're going to keep scaling up the network. And the path towards profitability, the long-term financial profile of the business remains the same and it is a function of us achieving scale greater than where we're adding human capital. Human capital is what's driving all of these we think fantastic results and we're still well prepared to keep investing into what we think is an incredible growth opportunity. I'll start and then Max can add on. I mean I think we're actually \u2013 we included that slide in the supplement because we're really proud of what's going on underneath the surface, where we have a step change in the number of users 150% growth and increasing frequency when you have that much user growth is actually really challenging. And if you look at a chart and look at just the total transactions from repeat users and the growth there alongside the net new user growth. It is a really \u2013 which feels like a really good spot the business. There is some impact with respect to the rate of new user growth on unit economics. First time use tends to be slightly less profitable than the lifetime value of the consumer. And so you do have a little bit of start-up costs associated with that user growth. But as Max mentioned before, long-term, that's much more important to us. So we're going to keep adding users at a very aggressive clip. We're going to stay focused on that. And part of the reason we have so much confidence in the long-term economics is that's happening right alongside tremendous growth in repeat usage on the platform. And we talked about network effects in the business. That's what that means. And in the long run it gives us all the confidence in the world around where the economics will ultimately be. Yeah. I think what you saw in the disclosure around the delinquency trend is similar to -- I think, you should think about it which is to-date our credit outcomes are still a function of the decisions we've taken with respect to approval rates. There's obviously any number of seasonal effects that do require taking a fine tooth co-mover. But not seeing the broader weakness that others have seen in our overall credit performance. And feel really good about where we're at. And that's what gives us again the confidence to give the guide that we have for this quarter. Yeah. So the Amazon is part of it. But while the growth rate in Amazon -- well the addition of Amazon is great for us. As we communicated, we still doubled GMV excluding Amazon. And so, -- we know there's a lot of growth happening across the whole portfolio. So it's not just limited to Amazon. But the interest-bearing portfolio is growing quite quickly. And that does tend to have that effect that you talked about. The other obvious impact with respect to the revenue-less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV is the mix towards, Split Pay, again, as it does run lower. Again, it's a repeated theme with us but product mix really does shake out with respect to the take rates on both revenue and the revenue less transaction costs. And again, I think the only other thing to repeat is, we feel like we're operating at the higher end of the range that we've given folks in that 3% to 4% range and have a lot of confidence again in our long-term unit economics here. And again, would put ourselves up against anybody in our space with respect to the rates at which we're delivering here. Yeah. Our current guidance reflects all of our current thinking on where they're at. We had frankly a good quarter in Q2 above our internal expectations. And feel like they're still delivering an incredible amount of volume for us. And we admire their brand. And we admire the loyalty that they have amongst their consumers. And we'll keep partnering with them. We launched with them in Australia this past quarter. And we're going to keep helping them grow their business. Yes. And so, 15% to 20% is a good number, how big could it be? It could be very big. Just like we have a launch of interest-bearing on Shopify. We haven't launched Split Pay with either of our two largest enterprise merchants. So I have a lot of confidence that that number can continue to go out. I think the only other point with respect to the rest of the portfolio growth is just, we are up against continued elevated levels in our, call it, a long-term zero finance business. And we would continue to expect some of that to be a drag on the balance of the portfolio, but not something that we're trying to again target a Q3 growth number. We're thinking about how this network scales and then how those network effects show up with repeat usage across the whole portfolio. Yes. Just the total avoidance of doubt, all of our outlook reflects the forward curve. And so there's roughly 180 basis points of rate increases. We take that into all of our models when we give guidance. It's consistent with the market expectation of rate movement. And so we talk about rising rates. That's not a problem for us at all. That's already reflected in the guidance. Yes, that's right. The mix impact of the business the growth that we saw which was obviously well in excess of the guidance that we had given in the quarter tended to mix towards either lower revenue transaction costs take rates as a percentage of the total or tend to be a little bit more back-end weighted. And both those two effects caused the percent to go down, despite the fact that we did of course beat the guidance on a dollar basis. Yes. If you look at the merchant take rate slide again in the supplement, you'll see that we're doing quite well on the Split Pay business with respect to our ability to continue to earn good fees. We're not breaking out profitability by a partner. But I think a key part of the reason we were able to deliver these exceptional enterprise experiences to the largest merchants is the fact that we're not just reliant on merchant fees. The fact that we do have consumer interest in the economic model does allow us to get to the merchant fee clearing rates that work for largest enterprises while still delivering  really strong unit economics. Yes. Characteristic is mostly human capital combined with marketing investments on the non-GAAP side. On the GAAP side, there's also the impact associated with stock-based compensation, D&A, and the other non-cash items. I think we will stand by our long-term guidance that we gave in September around the profitability of the business being a function of the growth rate. So, while we're growing like this, we are going to keep investing in that human capital to build great products and delight consumers. And when and if that growth rate ever starts to slow down, you'll see us grow expenses much slower and begin to deliver positive adjusted operating income. I think of the profitability or bottom-line measures that we really manage to, the adjusted operating income number is what we intend to hit. It's where we have the guidance out for you for this period and that's the number that we think will become scaling up and down as growth rates change. No, I think we still continue to have very well-received deals in the market both single counterparty deals and our forward flow relationships. As I mentioned in the script, we had a great deal of capacity by adding new partners and upsizing existing ones. And we still continue to receive a lot of demand for the assets. And our securitization activity has also been very successful. And you're going to see us continue to be very, very active there in both of those two markets and levers to continue to grow our business and deliver we think again excellent capital efficiency."

At this time, all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Following the speakers\u2019 remarks, we'll open the lines for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ron Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin.\nRon Clark : Thanks, Operator. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today.  These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the Company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them, except as required by law. In addition, today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to, but not as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's earnings press release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. Hosting today's call are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Welcome everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. Q1 was yet another record quarter for Affirm as we continued to rapidly grow both sides of our network. We increased GMV to more than $2.7 billion during the period which we closed with some really great momentum. We achieved our first ever billion-dollar GMV month in September and had over 102,000 active merchants and 8.7 million active consumers at the end of the first fiscal quarter. That said, we measure Affirm's result and impact in years and decades, not months and quarters.  This allows us to think strategically about delighting consumers and delivering value to our merchant partners while building an exciting brand on a foundation of trust. The seeds we planted years ago are just beginning to bear fruit. The growth of our network is accelerating and my confidence in Affirm's market position has never been stronger. Deep, tech powered partnerships with exceptional partners form a key part of our multiyear growth strategy. These are beginning to scale up and we are continuously investing in delivering even more value for our partners with new ideas and products.  Our partnership with Shopify is showing really strong signs of scale and impact. We'll touch on the exact numbers in a moment, but glance at the active merchant number to get a good sense for how that is starting to take shape. We continued to rapidly expand our partnership with Walmart. As recently announced, Affirm is providing Walmart's consumers an efficient alternative to layaway for the holiday shopping season. In November, Walmart and Affirm will be marketing together across a variety of digital and physical channels, including TV walls in over 3900 Walmart stores. Our deep engagement with this all-important partner helped meaningfully accelerate our GMV with Walmart over the last year.  We see even more opportunities to serve Walmart and its consumers in the year ahead. On the strength of our test results, we're also deepening our relationship with Amazon to help accelerate the growth of our network. Affirm will now serve as Amazon's only credit card alternative in the buy now pay later space through the next two holiday seasons in the United States. Eligible Amazon customers will have the opportunity to use Affirm at checkout on  Amazon, providing them with a transparent and flexible way to pay at their own pace. Affirm will also be embedded as a payment method in Amazon Pay's Digital Wallet, and become available to all consumers and merchants that use Amazon Pay at checkout in the U.S. Finally, we continued to close, launch, and expand our enterprise partnerships, broadening our network reach.  We launched American Airlines and Apple Canada, re-signed three-year deals with Priceline and Signet, launched a deeper integration with Target, which more than doubled our current Target business, and closed brand new partnerships with Newegg and Michaels. Platform and merchant partnerships and the strong growth of our consumer platform represent an incredible  opportunity to expand the potential reach of our mission to hundreds of millions of people, and we are excited to bring them access to our honest financial products. On a lighter note, I'm excited to share that we've launched our consumer holiday campaign just this week. You might catch us on social media while streaming TV and on billboards in several markets.  The campaign explores the stupid and stressful things that can happen around the busy holiday season, from questionable gifts through regrettable behavior, and juxtaposes that with Affirm, the smart choice for paying at your own pace with no late fees, no gotchas, and no regrets.  There's a lot to be proud of this quarter and even more to be excited about in the years to come. Affirm's core strengths lie in risk management, capital markets execution, and putting our ability to solve hard technical problems, toward building great products and creating consumer delight. With the context of the great unbundling of the credit card, we gave you a sneak peek into parts of our product roadmap at our Investor Forum in September.  Let me update you on the progress we've made on this product's hits. After being put through its paces by hundreds of Affirmers, our debit plus card is out in the wild, being further tested by consumers as we make our way through our waitlist and get it ready for gen pop launch in the New Year.  We also shipped the first version of our super app. While it's still very early days, and many versions will follow this one, I'm excited to see the meaningful increase in the consumer engagement that has already driven across products, particularly our shopping platform. Cashback rewards and crypto savings are both live in a pilot mode, which you may have already seen in your app, or will soon.  We also launched a firm in Australia last week with our long-time enterprise partner Peloton. Extending our international reach by partnering with our merchants wherever they do business is an important facet of our growth strategy, and we see many more markets to come. Stay tuned.  Finally, adaptive checkout, the reinvention of our core business, is fully live in the market, has delivered an over 25% conversion lift, and has already been adopted by 44% of eligible merchants. Let me go back to something I touched on briefly a moment ago. A firm's core strength can be summed up to one thing; our extraordinary team. It's hard to overstate just how much of our success to date is rooted in the exceptional level of talent and sheer grit of our people.  The key strategic insight leading to the creation of the great unbundling thesis, was the fear and loathing of the credit card by the Millennial generation as they came of age after the financial crisis. Related to this, was the dramatic rerouting of the flow of intellectual capital. In the prior decade, the best and brightest technical minds flocked to Wall Street to learn and earn.  Suddenly, they craved something else professionally. They needed a mission, a chance to fix the problems of the financial system that had failed their families. Our mission is at the very core of who we are. Combined with a firm belief that any solution to societal problems must be self-sustaining and profitable to stand the test of time, it has allowed us to attract amazing talent since the very early days of Affirm, many of whom are still here today a decade later.  The output of our engineering team is the key reason why we have become the partner of choice for so many giants of commerce. Our partners rely on us to show up with solutions for scale, speed, and reliability, and to work tirelessly and intelligently to deliver results. Our risk and data science teams were founded on the belief that traditional credit scoring excluded far too many people from access to credit, and the conviction that alternative data sources can be utilized in creative and compliant ways to dramatically expand this access without compromising risk performance.  A very similar origin story is alive and well today in our legal and compliance team. Several of them hail from key supervising regulators like FDIC, the Fed, and the CFPB. Our commitment to winning the right way with no fine-print and no late or hidden fees is what brought them to Affirm.  This update will become prohibitively long if I were to properly highlight each team and their contributions to our many successes so far, so I hope you will indulge me with just one anecdote featuring a great many Affirmers. As we readied the rollout of Shop Pay Installments, powered by Affirm, in the late spring of this year, we needed a way to onboard several hundred thousand Shopify merchants. To review them for eligibility, identifying soft corner cases, inspect them for regulatory and compliance issues. Of course, eventually this would all be done by machine learning models, examining the site content and scoring it, but to build this type of model, you need a reasonable prior knowledge from previously approved merchants and we hadn't yet accumulated enough of that at the time.  At the regular reviewer capacity, merchant ops would take several months and we wanted to launch in 3 weeks. We had about 1000 employees at the time. If a large percentage would manually review a few 100 shops each, we would be ready to launch within the time allotted and collect an excellent training set of data to build the models for automated approval. Within a day, we had organized robust online training classes for our \"volunteer reviewers\" a leaderboard for those competing on review productivity, and operation Shopapalooza (ph) was up and running. Execs and interns alike would finish their already busy workdays, picked up their next batch of Shopify merchant URLs and gift reviewing. Meanwhile, our machine - learning team shipped new software tools every day to help automate more and more of the reviewer tasks.  I maintained a respectable top 20 - ish position on the productivity leaderboard, but got completely overrun by Michael and his team a few days before the wrap, only to watch him get left behind by the machine - learning folks who had automated the review process after 2 weeks. We have the data, we've built the models, and we were ready to launch. It's easy to dismiss this episode as a pandemic era, Zoom -addled startup antic but I think it's very revealing.  We have assembled perhaps the most formidable fintech team ever. And in addition to talent, even ten years in, we have maintained the startup grit and are never afraid to roll up our sleeves to achieve our goals. I want to thank Affirmers for another excellent quarter and a great beginning to an important year for our Company. It's a privilege to lead this team and an honor to work with all of you. Now, off to Michael, who will take us through the numbers.\nMichael Linford: Thanks, Max. And good afternoon, everyone. Our Q1 results demonstrate the powerful impacts that our team and our investments in technology are having on our business. But before I get into the results for the quarter, I want to share some details about our expanded agreement with Amazon. Although we just announced our original relationship with Amazon at the end of August, the results we've seen have enabled us to expand beyond our task that began earlier this year. We are now ramping towards general availability, which we expect to achieve by the end of the calendar year. Our expanded agreement makes Affirm the only credit card alternative in the  space in the United States through January 2023. We are also excited to announce that Affirm will be embedded as a payment method in Amazon Pay at all eligible U.S. merchants. The initial term of our amended agreement will go through January 2025.  Together with a team at Amazon, we crafted an agreement that aligns our interest with equity grants tied to our growth. Amazon will receive an initial grant of 1 million penny warrant, and an additional 6 million that vest over the initial term of the contract, when certain performance conditions are met. Given the Amazon's massive consumer base, we expect this partnership to help create a step change in our network's scale. To ensure continued alignment on that goal, Amazon has the opportunity to vest up to an additional 15 million warrants with a $100 strike price tied to the scale up of our user network over the next 7 years. We're excited to deepen our relationships with Amazon to deliver an exceptional consumer experience while delivering shareholder value.  This deal is another proof point in our leadership as the enterprise partner of choice. Enterprises pick Affirm because we are the technology leader. And now, we have integrated relationships with partners representing approximately 60% of U.S. e-commerce. This is a big win, and we are just getting started. Now, let me turn to the quarter's results. Looking at the big picture, we continue to expand our two-sided network while delivering strong top-line growth and industry-leading unit economics. Zooming in, we scaled both our consumer and merchant networks dramatically, growing active consumers by 124% to 8.7 million, and increasing active merchants to a staggering 102,000 from just 6,500 a year ago. GMV grew 84% and revenue grew 55%, both ahead of our outlook. Excluding our largest merchant, that growth was even stronger.  GMV grew 138% and revenue increased 99%. That top-line growth generated strong unit economics, with revenue less transaction costs up 103% to $112 million or 4.1% of GMV, a 38 basis-point increase. Even as we significantly grew our network, we also improved our capital efficiency, demonstrating our disciplined approach to scaling. The equity capital we used to fund our loans decreased on a dollar basis by 36% from last year to just $140 million, representing less than 3% of our $5 billion total platform portfolio. Given our strategic progress in strong Q1 results, we have raised our outlook for GMV, revenue, and revenue less transaction costs for Fiscal Year '22, which I will discuss in detail in a moment.  Before I do that, let's walk through the results. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons refer to our first fiscal quarter of '22, versus Q1 at Fiscal '21. Active consumers increased 124% to $8.7 million, which corresponds to a $1.6 million sequential increase from Q4. And over the past 2 quarters, we have added 3.3 million net new consumers to our network. One of the key drivers of the strong Q1 performance was the ramp of our partnership with Shopify, which has enabled merchants to provide consumers with a fast, seamless pay-over-time product. After making Shop Pay Installments widely available in June, we have worked closely with Shopify to drive merchant uptake and consumer adoption.  As part of that effort, in the first quarter, we ran a limited time promotion for Shopify merchants to demonstrate the impact of Shop Pay Installments. The success of that promotion and the ramp of our partnership accelerated the growth of our network. While Shopify was a significant driver of user growth, we also experienced broad-base adoption across other merchants and categories. Our recently acquired Paybright in returning businesses also contributed a combined 120,000 new consumers sequentially from Q4 and 1.3 million from last year. Our partnership with Shopify also drove more than a 15-time increase in active merchants from 6,500 in the prior year to more than 102,000 in Q1. On a sequential basis, active merchants, which is calculated over a 12 -- trailing 12-month time frame, grew 3.5 times from the June-ending quarter.  While a relatively small impact to growth, I would also note that Paybright in return, we added about 2,600 incremental merchants. Moving to GMV, we grew GMV 84% in our first quarter to over $2.7 billion, exceeding our outlook. This growth reflects traction across all products and verticals and our ability to serve a diverse set of merchants and consumers across a wide set of transaction types and sizes. Importantly, our strong growth reflects not only the new merchant partnerships we've signed, but also the deep partnerships we are forging with our existing merchants. Excluding our largest merchant, our GMV with merchants that have been on Affirm's platform for 12 months or longer grew 70%, reflecting an increased share cart within this group of merchants.  We delivered triple-digit GMV growth in several categories. Our travel business grew 8-fold from last year's suppressed baseline, reaching a new high watermark. Our strong position among broad line retailers, including Walmart and Target, drove a 170% increase in GMV for this category compared to last year. The apparel category also remained a real bright spot, growing 128% year-over-year, which in our view shows the value of strong low AOV offerings when paired with high AOV products. To sum it up, the quality, depth, and breadth of our merchant partners, as well as our ability to address a wider range of transaction types, are key areas of strength for Affirm and their delivering results. In addition to helping our integrated merchant partners drive conversion, our direct-to-consumer virtual card product also delivered triple-digit growth, growing 119%, demonstrating strong adoption of our offerings, particularly among returning consumers.  We had a strong quarter outside the U.S. as our Canadian business added over $100 million of GMV. We serve a wide range of merchants and large enterprises in Canada, including Apple, which launched in the first quarter and has exceeded our expectations to date. Beyond Canada, we see a great opportunity to expand internationally by bringing our products to more of the regions that our merchant partners serve. As part of that strategy, we are excited to deepen our relationship with Peloton by launching in Australia. Our business with Peloton globally remains strong in the first quarter, with GMV more than doubling, compared to the more normal quarter ending September 2019.  As a reminder, in late calendar year 2020, Peloton transitioned to capturing transactions upon shipment versus authorization, which makes our Peloton GMV comparison skewed through the first half of our fiscal '22. Peloton 's concentration declined to 8% of our GMV this quarter, compared to 29% in the year ago quarter. And given our strong broad-based growth, no other merchant partner accounted for more than 5% of our GMV. While we are still in the early stages of our partnership with Shopify, we are already seeing some of the trends associated with the rapid growth of our split pay offering which currently power Shop Pay Installments. First growth in lower AOV categories has accelerated, resulting in an expected AOV decline from $661 one year ago to $402 in Q1.  Additionally, we are seeing continued growth in frequency, as transactions for active consumer rose 8% to approximately 2.3%. Finally, we expect the growth in our slip pay business which has a generally lower merchant discount rate than our 0% APR business strive lower total revenue yield as a percentage of GMV, albeit with lower total transaction costs once we reach scale. Now turning to the financials. The strength in GMV helped us deliver strong Q1 revenue growth. Net revenue of $269 million grew 55% year-over-year, and also exceeded our Q1 outlook. Total network Revenue grew 13%, but that figure masks much stronger underlying results. Excluding merchant fees earned from our largest merchant partner in Q1. Total revenue growth was 99% and total network revenue growth was 81%.  As a percentage of GMV, revenue was 10%, consistent with our outlook. The 190-basis point decline from last year was driven by the mix shift away from longer duration, 0% APR loans. On the expense side, we achieved significant leverage on transaction costs. Total transaction costs of $157 million grew 33% year-over-year, compared to revenue growth at 55%. With the mix shift I described a moment ago, loss on loan purchase commitment declined 22% while improvements in our Capital program limited the growth of funding costs to 62%, despite growing liabilities we used to fund our loans by 76%. Provision for credit losses grew at 120%, driven by the provision releases in the comparable period, but also reflecting the credit loosening initiated earlier this year.  Our credit outlook and position remain the same as we described in our investor forum. We expect to continue to see the impact of credit loosening, resulting in intentionally higher allowances, which in turn drive provisions for credit losses in each period. The robust top-line growth and leverage and transaction costs resulted in higher revenue, less transaction costs, which grew 103% to $112 million or 4.1% of GMV. With the strong growth in unit economics, as well as the massive opportunities we see, we are continuing to invest for the long term.  As Max discussed, in Q1, we continued to invest in building our team. We were also investing in marketing to build our brand and scale our network. This resulted in higher personnel costs and stock-based compensation in technology and data analytics, as well as sales and marketing. In Q1, total operating expenses outside of transaction costs, grew $190 million, driven by an $87 million increase in stock-based compensation, primarily due to the IPO in January. Excluding SBC, these expenses grew 125%. GAAP operating loss was $166 million compared to a loss of $33 million last year. Adjusted operating loss was $45 million in the quarter compared to an $8 million loss in the prior year.  Turning to our balance sheet, we delivered another strong quarter of GMV growth while continuing to drive greater efficiency from a capital perspective. Total platform portfolio grew from $3 billion to $5 billion at the end of Q1 and we increased our overall funding capacity from $4.2 billion last year to $7.3 billion. Our disciplined approach also drove a reduction in the equity capital we used to fund our business from $220 million to just $140 million despite growing our loans in the balance Sheet by more than $800 million year-over-year. Accordingly, as a percentage of total platform portfolio, Equity Capital Required fell to an all-time low of 3% from 8% last year.  Now, looking to the year ahead, we expect the strategic progress we've made in fiscal Q1, as well as the strength we are experiencing in consumer and merchant adoption to help drive even stronger results for fiscal '22. Accordingly, we are raising our outlook for the year. We now expect GMV to increase between 58% and 61% from fiscal year '21, to between $13.13 billion to $13.38 billion. We expect revenue of $1.225 to $1.250 billion representing year-over-year growth of 41% to 44%. We expect transaction costs of $645 to $655 million resulting in revenue less transaction costs of $580 to $595 million. Finally, we expect an adjusted operating loss as a percentage of total revenue up 12% to 14% as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business. We expect weighted average shares of approximately $290 million for the year, consistent with our prior outlook.  While these financial results do not include the benefit of our recently signed partnership Amazon, we have included the impact of any warrants previously mentioned with $1 million vesting upon signing and $6 million vesting quarterly over the three-year contractual period. And given the same trends, we are also raising our outlook for our second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021. We now expect GMV to grow 71% to 76% to $3.55 to $3.65 billion, total revenue of $320 to $330 million, total transaction costs of $143 million to $148 million, revenue less transaction costs of $178 million to $183 million, adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 5% to 7%, and weighted average shares outstanding of $285 million. In closing, I want to add my thanks to the Affirmers who helped deliver such strong results. Our team is the best part of my job here, and their continued ingenuity and hard work enable us to impact the lives of millions of consumers. Max and I will now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To join the question queue, . The first question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. I'm wondering, Michael, you talked about previously expanding the credit box and the benefits that you get. You seem to be repeating that. Can you just talk about how that progressed thus far and how we should anticipate that impacting on things like reserves, etc. going forward? Thank you.\nMichael Linford: So again, consistent with as we talked about it at the Investor Forum, we ran the business at a very tight level coming out of COVID and have been on a path, over the past year, of slowly relaxing in the credit box. We've also seen the impact of mix in our business that would show up as well, but the governor for us is always that, revenue less transaction costs. We think about credit as a thing that we control and choose, not something that happens to us. That being said, we're generally very conservative in how we think about provisioning and the allowance that we maintain. We always want to be careful here and we do expect that some of that conservatism may show up in the Q2 guidance we've given for revenue less transaction costs. Where we do think that we're probably on the more conservative end of the allowance, as we sit here today.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Makes sense. And then Max, I wanted to ask you. When you look at the growth in the messaging and availability of Affirm and you look at all the merchants that you're reaching now, how are you thinking about measuring that in terms as it relates to transactions per active user and how you would like to see that track, and what kind of expectations should we be having as investors? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: Great question. So, for a little while, as much as I enjoy setting obnoxious goals and trying to beat them, I think we should expect the denominator to overwhelm the numerator. We signed a bunch of really powerful partnerships with massive distribution, tailwinds built into them. And so, no matter how good we are at rolling out products that drive huge repeats, I suspect the second derivative there is going to get overwhelmed by the second derivative opposite the share user growth. So, for a time the transactions per user, my guess is it will be hard to predict, simply because the ramp-up of things like Amazon and even Shopify, which is still quite early, will be a little bit tricky to predict. That said, we want the transactions per users to be up and to the right as much as possible.  I think that the real step change, and Michael will probably not let me talk about this next quarter, but I hope to start talking about a little later, there's going to be a very -- in my opinion at least, there's going to be very different number of transactions per user for those that take on our Debit+ product, and the ones that haven't yet. The Debit+ consumers are -- we expect them, we ask them, we welcome them to use the product daily. And the idea there is to really start tracking into as often as easy or debit card. Obviously, that won't be a 100% of our user base for quite some time, especially as the user base itself grows, but we'll start talking about our super users, our power users and what they are really experiencing as an important metric for us. But those are the ones that we really expect to just have outsized  numbers.\nJames Faucette: Thanks for that, Max. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys. Congrats on the results and the progress. What about -- asking about the amazon extension here, just want to be clear, what is new from previous? It looks like the exclusivity for one year in the warrants. And then secondly, just trying to think about timing, but it sounds like Amazon will happen this holiday season. So, are we just being conservative, not putting it into the quarterly numbers because we don't know how big it will be? Just a little thought process around that. Thanks.\nMichael Linford: Thank you. So, I think we are the sole h by  partner through Gen 23. That's important and powerful. Our last 8-k, I think said very So, explicitly, this is a non-exclusive pilot so the most important quality to change here is Amazon had their pick obviously in partners in the space. They tested us. We pass the test. We passed with flying colors and better. And so, I think that's a very important qualitative matter here. The Amazon Pay and setting is new. That was not in the last conversation which is important so we said it before and I'll say it again.\nMax Levchin: The war for wallet placement to be a tender inside the important wallets is really kind of the next page in the history of financial services form of payments and it's important for us to be embedded in important wallets. And so, frankly, the fact that we are ramping pretty quickly to this holiday season is -- was not explicit in our last announcement. I think at the time we made it, may have classified it as a hope and not a strategy, which should be live in this holiday season presently. That's the qualitative matters. Michael can describe the details of the financial arrangements with them.\nMichael Linford: Yes, the warrants are new, meaning it's an important piece of aligning incentives. If you think about the posture of the relationship, you're dealing with someone as large and within much scale as Amazon, it's a good thing to have them invest it in the outcomes that are good for you and that's how we thought about it as we worked on that amendment. In terms of why not have it in the forecast, yes, it's exactly right. Our approach to building forecasts and giving guidance is we need to see it before we commit to it. We're just now beginning the process of fully ramping this out to. Over the next couple of weeks and then throughout the rest of the holiday season we'll have a pretty good read and be prepared to give you some pretty clear guidance coming into the next quarter.\nBryan Keane: Excellent. And just one follow-up on the Shop relationship. How much further do we have to go before we get to a full run rate by quarter or maybe some of the things that might happen to get us there? Obviously, it's off to a great start, but trying to figure out how much more room there is to grow, just to get to a run rate. Is that a quarter or two or is that going to be a several year process?\nMax Levchin: I'll give a qualitative answer as is my custom and Michael may or may not is going to add a little bit more. But probably the most important thing to understand about us as a Company, we don't build a thing and start selling it and roll it out, and that's it. The reason Shopify partnered with us, the reason all these great enterprises look at us and say, \"This is the right partner for us, \" is because we come into a relationship with a plan to build more stuff. If you look at the pace of growth at Walmart, which has been a partner for numerous years, it's growing in a -- and accelerating quick. It's not because somehow, things have ripened on a tree and now they're ready to pick.  It's because we continued to invest in relationship and build new code (ph). It's like the whole sort of DNA of Affirm is let -- build things that help us grow faster. So, we are in control of that growth. It makes it a little harder to predict too, but if we do it right, it will accelerate. That's probably the most important takeaway. And Michael wants to commit to a forecasting schedule, but I just want to make sure that that part is clear.\nMichael Linford: I would just add on the call to your comment that we're not yet fully optimized there. We're really excited with the traction that we are seeing, but there's a lot of work left to do. I think that we've got many precedence here as we think about enterprise ramps. They don't happen in weeks and months, they happen in quarters, and oftentimes even years. That's the horizon with which we're investing effort to optimize this program. So, we think there's still a lot of work to do and we're definitely not near the peak.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg : Hey, thanks, guys. Yeah. I just want to start on Amazon as well. Should we expect that you will monetize the Amazon volume more on the consumer side than the merchant side? Will these mostly be interest-bearing loans? And is there the opportunity to perhaps use the third-party manufacturer model that you used with Walmart? And then, just on the exclusivity element, was just wondering if Affirm is anyway subject to that as well in terms of doing business with any of Amazon's competitors? I didn't see anything about that in the 8-K, but just wanted to check.\nMichael Linford: Yeah. On your first question, the product that is currently live on Amazon.com is an interest-bearing product which is skewed towards consumer monetization. Although of course, we will monetize that either by keeping on the balance sheet or selling it to capital partners on a 4-12 basis. And so won't necessarily hit the interest income line on the income statement. That's the part of life today. However, we have the opportunity and desires to eventually broaden the whole portfolio for Amazon.com But also importantly, with inside of Amazon Pay where that relationship is going to start with a wide set of products. As for the questions around the nature of our unique relationship, we are not obligated to not serve any partner. We generally don't agree to that any context. I think it's very important for our network to remain open.\nJason Kupferberg : Great. Then just as a follow-up, I wanted to see if we can get an update just on the non-Peloton GMV growth guidance for the year. I wasn't sure if the -- all of the GMV raise is coming on the non-Peloton side. I think previously you were talking about 70% to 75% for the Fiscal year, and I wanted to see what that looks like now. Thanks.\nMichael Linford: Yeah. We're not going to update any forward-looking number for Peloton, except to say that the Q1 results for us on Peloton did exceed our internal estimates, and there's certainly nothing that we've seen to suggest that we should be changing our outlook overall in light of where that business is at.\nJason Kupferberg : Okay. Great. Well, congrats on the results.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal : Hi. Thanks for taking my question this evening. I also wanted to ask a clarifying question on Amazon. Is the use of Affirm on the platform for baskets over $50 or for individual products on Amazon that are priced higher than $50? It's a bit of a nuance, but it actually makes a difference when we try to put pen to paper and model it out.\nMax Levchin: Initially it will be for baskets over $50. The way that integration works today is it's -- is at the checkout and as we work to get the up-funnel presentment, that will probably be limited to a more narrow set up of items.\nRamsey El-Assal : I see. Okay. And I wanted also to ask about Travel and Ticketing as a percentage of total GMV. It looked like it fell this quarter to about 10% versus about 14% last quarter. I'm figuring a lot of that problem may have to do with mix and the Shopify ramp, but I'm just trying to figure out whether there's also some kind of delta impact in there. And then, what expectations around the travel recovery are included in your guidance?\nMax Levchin: The travel business did have a slight sequential decline period-on-period, which probably is a result of COVID, but there is also really strong seasonality in that business, and of course that seasonality has been heavily impacted by all of the COVID trends. The year-on-year growth of course, it's still extremely strong, given the low baselines. I think we've been pretty careful not to put too much risk in the guidance around travels, so we don't -- we're not really assuming any further resurgence in travel. We talked about, last year that  travel at 10% was a good number for us and we think that's still probably the case.\nRamsey El-Assal : Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nTim Chiodo: Thanks a lot for taking the question. I want to dig in a little bit on Shop Pay installments, just wanted to see if you could give us some context on the pricing dynamic there. When you're offering the product into Shopify merchants, are they being presented a different price based on their size or their AOV or a specific vertical or category they're in? Are the larger Shopify merchants able to negotiate this? Just wanted to see if you could bring to life how that works. And then I have a quick follow-up also related to Shop Pay installments.\nMax Levchin: Obviously, there's quite a lot of nuances for merchants' relationship with Affirm and Shopify as they get up in scale. So generally speaking, there is a rate that merchants encounter as we bring your product to market, depending on some of the sort of the other parts of the relationship with the shop. They may or may not see changes to it, but generally speaking, it's reasonable to expect that the largest merchants on Shopify probably have a human that talks about the prices, and some of the smaller ones have a price that they can click to accept and everything.\nTim Chiodo: Perfect. Thank you, Max., The follow-up is more around the GMV guide. I apologize if I missed it, but I know that last quarter, when you gave the initial guidance for the year, you mentioned that split pay, including the shop would be roughly 10% to 15% of the total mix of GMV. Is that still roughly the portion that we should be expecting or did that maybe move a little higher?\nMichael Linford: We're not updating the guide for that number, but what we will say is that in Q1 we were right in the middle of that range for split Pay offering.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thanks a lot, Michael. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist. Please go ahead.\nGus: Hi, this is Gus (ph), stepping on for Andrew. Generally, thinking about the industry, is it moving -- in your view, is it moving more towards direct integrations? And related to that, how do we think about Mastercard 's announcement today, launching an open loop BNPL products?\nMax Levchin: So, I think, generally speaking, it's a fairly varied landscape out there. So, if you are a platform hosting numerous merchants or serving merchants, as an -- for example on the back-end, whether it's processing or other types of merchant services. Those are national points for direct integration for Affirm. And that's -- I think that's something that you can expect to continue. Obviously, we pride ourselves on our engineering chops. So, when we come to these partnerships, we come in with a view to make it more efficient, make it faster, introduce new transactional semantics, which may be essential for consumers and merchants, and I think all of that is just something that -- we certainly intend to continue doing.  In terms of MasterCard's announcement, it doesn't really change our world at all to be honest, in a sense that our network -- our network differentiation, is ability to see and benefit from the skews embedded in transactions, being able to utilize some end-to-end connectivity that we have being both the . To map it to traditional networks issue or acquire and then we're all 3 at all times, in which allows us to build some pretty unique products and services.  I think the national announcement and  before that were all targeted at bringing along other credit issuers that may want to play in the BNPL space, which I think is good advice. In general, moving away from revolving credit towards installments, ended loans is just healthier for the consumer. So, positive for the industry, I'm glad that Mastercard is stepping up to support it. We'll continue building our unique thing and I'm glad to see the industry moving towards products that we find here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Bauch from SMBC. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Bauch: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Active customer growth continues to trend pretty strongly quarter-over-quarter. So maybe I was just wondering, is anything evolved in your strategy? Still word of mouth or are you guys being a little bit more aggressive on the customer acquisition front? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: By far, the most important growth of consumers for us comes from our merchant partners. I think they've just -- we've said it before and I'll say it again. Our number 1 growth strategy is signing best, most popular, most successful merchants in delivering conversion and uplift for them so that they, and affirm can benefit together. So that's what we continue doing. Our growth is -- that budget is largely represented in our engineering budget, to put it in financial terms, perhaps. You'll see us step out a little bit of our comfort zone. That is to say, it was never done, a national -- regional marketing campaign and . Very uncomfortable territory for me, maybe 3 or 4 years ago, something that we had to learn a couple years ago. And now look at us, we're taking out pretty things like TV commercials.  And so, you'll see us do more of that. That is fundamentally about teaching the end consumer that BNPL is here. It's important half of Americans we surveyed and we do survey all time have now expressed interest in using products like ours and the other half doesn't know what it is, which means that it's on us to educate the market and explain what this is and how it's fundamentally different from your credit card. It's less scary much more on your side. And then within that narrative how Affirm is unique in the sense that we don't charge late fees, we could do nasty things like deferred interest and all the various other gimmicks.  And so that is something that we'll continue doing, and one thing that we've learned in the context of understanding how to tell our own story, perhaps where we learn it, is as we got larger, more sophisticated, we partnered with a huge number of our merchants, in particular, our enterprise partners to promote our product in the context of their offerings. If you look at Affirm 5, 6 years ago, the idea of saying, hey, here's a really compelling bill, could be in a bicycle or a coach, or an article of clothing. Right now, pay later is something that you will see from a bike vendor, something that I might encounter in by my spare time.  Brew now, pay later is another line I've seen recently. We tend to have a lot of our partners in the coffee space given my personal election (ph),  equipment. As we learn how to drive these consumer messages which are -- we learn a lot about marketing, we also understood how to leverage the channel that our merchants have that are natural and native to them, how we can put both our intelligence and technology and dollars to work there. So always kept equal, you will see us do even more of that because we found this to be very efficient. I would not expect us to flunk really and develop into things like digital acquisition or mail drops, or anything, so the standard behaviors in the industry.\nMichael Linford: Then I just wanted to touch upon Debit+. I was one of the lucky ones to be a part of the beta program. I noticed that that program is upwards of 0.5 million people now. I thought that number was ultimately going to be a little bit less before the end of the year. Should we take that as an indication of stronger demand for Debit+ than when you had originally anticipated or is there some other variable a that we should be considering?\nMax Levchin: I was literally bracing myself for you to say something like, and then I got declined or something like that. I'm glad I use my Debit+ 4 to 5 times a day and I haven't been the declined since the early alpha, but I'm still in the nightmare of being declined for a card swipe, comes to me from my teenage years, and also in the canals of Affirm's history. So, it's hard to decide whether the pretty overwhelmingly positive support for Debit+ that we've gotten from our users is more or less than we expected. We ran another email to our entire unit base saying, hey, Debit+ is actually real.  If you're on a waiting list, sit tight it's coming, and if you're not on the waiting list, maybe you should. And then it moved the waiting list itself grew by another double-digit percentage is just going to string the single announcement within our own user base. So, we're going against the 0 cards, 1 year ago, so it will be infinite growth no matter how we slice it. So, I think it'll be great asking again in a few quarters how well we're doing. But all signs\u2019 points to it will be good, but I will channel my inner Michael, say, put your Excel spreadsheet down and forecast nothing. We will not know what this thing will look like for a while.  We're not budgeting any volume, any revenue in. It's a product that we're bringing out there because -- it's unique. There's really nothing like it out there forecasting into the full there. We think it's awesome. I literally swiped my card buying a bag of beans yesterday and the guy next to me in line said, whoa, that was so focus. First, on purpose, I split a transaction right in front of them on my phone and it's like, whoa man, what was that? And so, when we have a few millions of those happening, I'll be able to forecast how many more we'll have.\nMichael Linford: So, sit back and enjoy the experience.\nAndrew Bauch: Yeah, thanks guys.\nMax Levchin: Actually, Can I ask you a question?\nAndrew Bauch: Yeah absolutely.\nMax Levchin: Are you liking the card? Do you like the card, do you like the user experience?\nAndrew Bauch: Yeah, the experiences are pretty seamless. The feature to pay back and forth is pretty intuitive and I feel like the overall smoothness of the app and moving from place to place is pretty easy.\nMax Levchin: Nice. Excellent. If you're on the 1099 version, which may or may not have been pushed to you yet, you'll see like a Forex improvement in the loading speed of a transaction list on the prompting. It's really embarrassing what it was until the 1099. But once you get to 11, it'll be super-fast. Sorry.\nAndrew Bauch: I will keep on that. All right. Thanks, Max.\nMax Levchin: Customer research moment.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Chris Brendler from DA Davidson. Please go ahead.\nChris Brendler: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Michael, it seems like the bigger issue, given all the success, is going to be how you fund all this growth. And I just love to hear an update on how you're thinking about the funding picture. And also on the off-balance sheet securitizations, that tends to create some challenges, potentially, on the balance sheet, I don't see the securitization asset on there anymore. So how are you modeling that? And even as you open the credit box to it, do you expect the securitizations to be as successful as credit losses are subject to normalize? Thanks so much.\nMichael Linford: Your first question first. We grew total platform portfolio by about $2 billion. We added about $820 million on the Balance Sheet, made up of about 100 -- or of $1.1 billion that we securitized on the Balance Sheet, and about $250 million reduction in the warehouse funding, which is probably a little bit tighter even than we'd like to run it, that's what drove the really efficient equity capital required number that we posted this quarter. And of course, the rest of it grew off the Balance Sheet with the biggest piece being forward flow. I think that strategy is going to continue to be in play.  Today, we closed another zero-coupon securitization, or 0% financing programs or securitization and continue to have real success in that market despite the rate movements and the loosening of the credit box, so we're not convinced that we're going to have a real struggle there. And yet, as we've always discussed, our approach to capital is to ensure that we've got multiple sources to fund the business and we're not going to be wed to any one funding model or lever and continue to invest in growing capacity across all of our funding types.\nChris Brendler: What about the opportunity to grow deposits as an alternative funding source as you go? Maybe fast-forward 3 or 5 years ago, and it would be wholesale funded, obviously, so it seems like a huge opportunity and a potential solution to this problem of having too much growth.\nMichael Linford: I certainly appreciate the too much  problem. Our capital team works really hard to ensure that we've cut adequate capacity. They wake up every day ensuring that we can fund the business. Today our deposits are held by cause of a bank, and not outsourced funding for the business. But we will always keep an eye on other alternative methods as we scale this business at a pretty rapid clip.\nChris Brendler: Thank you so much. Congratulations.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Welcome everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. Q1 was yet another record quarter for Affirm as we continued to rapidly grow both sides of our network. We increased GMV to more than $2.7 billion during the period which we closed with some really great momentum. We achieved our first ever billion-dollar GMV month in September and had over 102,000 active merchants and 8.7 million active consumers at the end of the first fiscal quarter. That said, we measure Affirm's result and impact in years and decades, not months and quarters.  This allows us to think strategically about delighting consumers and delivering value to our merchant partners while building an exciting brand on a foundation of trust. The seeds we planted years ago are just beginning to bear fruit. The growth of our network is accelerating and my confidence in Affirm's market position has never been stronger. Deep, tech powered partnerships with exceptional partners form a key part of our multiyear growth strategy. These are beginning to scale up and we are continuously investing in delivering even more value for our partners with new ideas and products.  Our partnership with Shopify is showing really strong signs of scale and impact. We'll touch on the exact numbers in a moment, but glance at the active merchant number to get a good sense for how that is starting to take shape. We continued to rapidly expand our partnership with Walmart. As recently announced, Affirm is providing Walmart's consumers an efficient alternative to layaway for the holiday shopping season. In November, Walmart and Affirm will be marketing together across a variety of digital and physical channels, including TV walls in over 3900 Walmart stores. Our deep engagement with this all-important partner helped meaningfully accelerate our GMV with Walmart over the last year.  We see even more opportunities to serve Walmart and its consumers in the year ahead. On the strength of our test results, we're also deepening our relationship with Amazon to help accelerate the growth of our network. Affirm will now serve as Amazon's only credit card alternative in the buy now pay later space through the next two holiday seasons in the United States. Eligible Amazon customers will have the opportunity to use Affirm at checkout on  Amazon, providing them with a transparent and flexible way to pay at their own pace. Affirm will also be embedded as a payment method in Amazon Pay's Digital Wallet, and become available to all consumers and merchants that use Amazon Pay at checkout in the U.S. Finally, we continued to close, launch, and expand our enterprise partnerships, broadening our network reach.  We launched American Airlines and Apple Canada, re-signed three-year deals with Priceline and Signet, launched a deeper integration with Target, which more than doubled our current Target business, and closed brand new partnerships with Newegg and Michaels. Platform and merchant partnerships and the strong growth of our consumer platform represent an incredible  opportunity to expand the potential reach of our mission to hundreds of millions of people, and we are excited to bring them access to our honest financial products. On a lighter note, I'm excited to share that we've launched our consumer holiday campaign just this week. You might catch us on social media while streaming TV and on billboards in several markets.  The campaign explores the stupid and stressful things that can happen around the busy holiday season, from questionable gifts through regrettable behavior, and juxtaposes that with Affirm, the smart choice for paying at your own pace with no late fees, no gotchas, and no regrets.  There's a lot to be proud of this quarter and even more to be excited about in the years to come. Affirm's core strengths lie in risk management, capital markets execution, and putting our ability to solve hard technical problems, toward building great products and creating consumer delight. With the context of the great unbundling of the credit card, we gave you a sneak peek into parts of our product roadmap at our Investor Forum in September.  Let me update you on the progress we've made on this product's hits. After being put through its paces by hundreds of Affirmers, our debit plus card is out in the wild, being further tested by consumers as we make our way through our waitlist and get it ready for gen pop launch in the New Year.  We also shipped the first version of our super app. While it's still very early days, and many versions will follow this one, I'm excited to see the meaningful increase in the consumer engagement that has already driven across products, particularly our shopping platform. Cashback rewards and crypto savings are both live in a pilot mode, which you may have already seen in your app, or will soon.  We also launched a firm in Australia last week with our long-time enterprise partner Peloton. Extending our international reach by partnering with our merchants wherever they do business is an important facet of our growth strategy, and we see many more markets to come. Stay tuned.  Finally, adaptive checkout, the reinvention of our core business, is fully live in the market, has delivered an over 25% conversion lift, and has already been adopted by 44% of eligible merchants. Let me go back to something I touched on briefly a moment ago. A firm's core strength can be summed up to one thing; our extraordinary team. It's hard to overstate just how much of our success to date is rooted in the exceptional level of talent and sheer grit of our people.  The key strategic insight leading to the creation of the great unbundling thesis, was the fear and loathing of the credit card by the Millennial generation as they came of age after the financial crisis. Related to this, was the dramatic rerouting of the flow of intellectual capital. In the prior decade, the best and brightest technical minds flocked to Wall Street to learn and earn.  Suddenly, they craved something else professionally. They needed a mission, a chance to fix the problems of the financial system that had failed their families. Our mission is at the very core of who we are. Combined with a firm belief that any solution to societal problems must be self-sustaining and profitable to stand the test of time, it has allowed us to attract amazing talent since the very early days of Affirm, many of whom are still here today a decade later.  The output of our engineering team is the key reason why we have become the partner of choice for so many giants of commerce. Our partners rely on us to show up with solutions for scale, speed, and reliability, and to work tirelessly and intelligently to deliver results. Our risk and data science teams were founded on the belief that traditional credit scoring excluded far too many people from access to credit, and the conviction that alternative data sources can be utilized in creative and compliant ways to dramatically expand this access without compromising risk performance.  A very similar origin story is alive and well today in our legal and compliance team. Several of them hail from key supervising regulators like FDIC, the Fed, and the CFPB. Our commitment to winning the right way with no fine-print and no late or hidden fees is what brought them to Affirm.  This update will become prohibitively long if I were to properly highlight each team and their contributions to our many successes so far, so I hope you will indulge me with just one anecdote featuring a great many Affirmers. As we readied the rollout of Shop Pay Installments, powered by Affirm, in the late spring of this year, we needed a way to onboard several hundred thousand Shopify merchants. To review them for eligibility, identifying soft corner cases, inspect them for regulatory and compliance issues. Of course, eventually this would all be done by machine learning models, examining the site content and scoring it, but to build this type of model, you need a reasonable prior knowledge from previously approved merchants and we hadn't yet accumulated enough of that at the time.  At the regular reviewer capacity, merchant ops would take several months and we wanted to launch in 3 weeks. We had about 1000 employees at the time. If a large percentage would manually review a few 100 shops each, we would be ready to launch within the time allotted and collect an excellent training set of data to build the models for automated approval. Within a day, we had organized robust online training classes for our \"volunteer reviewers\" a leaderboard for those competing on review productivity, and operation Shopapalooza (ph) was up and running. Execs and interns alike would finish their already busy workdays, picked up their next batch of Shopify merchant URLs and gift reviewing. Meanwhile, our machine - learning team shipped new software tools every day to help automate more and more of the reviewer tasks.  I maintained a respectable top 20 - ish position on the productivity leaderboard, but got completely overrun by Michael and his team a few days before the wrap, only to watch him get left behind by the machine - learning folks who had automated the review process after 2 weeks. We have the data, we've built the models, and we were ready to launch. It's easy to dismiss this episode as a pandemic era, Zoom -addled startup antic but I think it's very revealing.  We have assembled perhaps the most formidable fintech team ever. And in addition to talent, even ten years in, we have maintained the startup grit and are never afraid to roll up our sleeves to achieve our goals. I want to thank Affirmers for another excellent quarter and a great beginning to an important year for our Company. It's a privilege to lead this team and an honor to work with all of you. Now, off to Michael, who will take us through the numbers. Great question. So, for a little while, as much as I enjoy setting obnoxious goals and trying to beat them, I think we should expect the denominator to overwhelm the numerator. We signed a bunch of really powerful partnerships with massive distribution, tailwinds built into them. And so, no matter how good we are at rolling out products that drive huge repeats, I suspect the second derivative there is going to get overwhelmed by the second derivative opposite the share user growth. So, for a time the transactions per user, my guess is it will be hard to predict, simply because the ramp-up of things like Amazon and even Shopify, which is still quite early, will be a little bit tricky to predict. That said, we want the transactions per users to be up and to the right as much as possible.  I think that the real step change, and Michael will probably not let me talk about this next quarter, but I hope to start talking about a little later, there's going to be a very -- in my opinion at least, there's going to be very different number of transactions per user for those that take on our Debit+ product, and the ones that haven't yet. The Debit+ consumers are -- we expect them, we ask them, we welcome them to use the product daily. And the idea there is to really start tracking into as often as easy or debit card. Obviously, that won't be a 100% of our user base for quite some time, especially as the user base itself grows, but we'll start talking about our super users, our power users and what they are really experiencing as an important metric for us. But those are the ones that we really expect to just have outsized  numbers. The war for wallet placement to be a tender inside the important wallets is really kind of the next page in the history of financial services form of payments and it's important for us to be embedded in important wallets. And so, frankly, the fact that we are ramping pretty quickly to this holiday season is -- was not explicit in our last announcement. I think at the time we made it, may have classified it as a hope and not a strategy, which should be live in this holiday season presently. That's the qualitative matters. Michael can describe the details of the financial arrangements with them. I'll give a qualitative answer as is my custom and Michael may or may not is going to add a little bit more. But probably the most important thing to understand about us as a Company, we don't build a thing and start selling it and roll it out, and that's it. The reason Shopify partnered with us, the reason all these great enterprises look at us and say, \"This is the right partner for us, \" is because we come into a relationship with a plan to build more stuff. If you look at the pace of growth at Walmart, which has been a partner for numerous years, it's growing in a -- and accelerating quick. It's not because somehow, things have ripened on a tree and now they're ready to pick.  It's because we continued to invest in relationship and build new code (ph). It's like the whole sort of DNA of Affirm is let -- build things that help us grow faster. So, we are in control of that growth. It makes it a little harder to predict too, but if we do it right, it will accelerate. That's probably the most important takeaway. And Michael wants to commit to a forecasting schedule, but I just want to make sure that that part is clear. Initially it will be for baskets over $50. The way that integration works today is it's -- is at the checkout and as we work to get the up-funnel presentment, that will probably be limited to a more narrow set up of items. The travel business did have a slight sequential decline period-on-period, which probably is a result of COVID, but there is also really strong seasonality in that business, and of course that seasonality has been heavily impacted by all of the COVID trends. The year-on-year growth of course, it's still extremely strong, given the low baselines. I think we've been pretty careful not to put too much risk in the guidance around travels, so we don't -- we're not really assuming any further resurgence in travel. We talked about, last year that  travel at 10% was a good number for us and we think that's still probably the case. Obviously, there's quite a lot of nuances for merchants' relationship with Affirm and Shopify as they get up in scale. So generally speaking, there is a rate that merchants encounter as we bring your product to market, depending on some of the sort of the other parts of the relationship with the shop. They may or may not see changes to it, but generally speaking, it's reasonable to expect that the largest merchants on Shopify probably have a human that talks about the prices, and some of the smaller ones have a price that they can click to accept and everything. So, I think, generally speaking, it's a fairly varied landscape out there. So, if you are a platform hosting numerous merchants or serving merchants, as an -- for example on the back-end, whether it's processing or other types of merchant services. Those are national points for direct integration for Affirm. And that's -- I think that's something that you can expect to continue. Obviously, we pride ourselves on our engineering chops. So, when we come to these partnerships, we come in with a view to make it more efficient, make it faster, introduce new transactional semantics, which may be essential for consumers and merchants, and I think all of that is just something that -- we certainly intend to continue doing.  In terms of MasterCard's announcement, it doesn't really change our world at all to be honest, in a sense that our network -- our network differentiation, is ability to see and benefit from the skews embedded in transactions, being able to utilize some end-to-end connectivity that we have being both the . To map it to traditional networks issue or acquire and then we're all 3 at all times, in which allows us to build some pretty unique products and services.  I think the national announcement and  before that were all targeted at bringing along other credit issuers that may want to play in the BNPL space, which I think is good advice. In general, moving away from revolving credit towards installments, ended loans is just healthier for the consumer. So, positive for the industry, I'm glad that Mastercard is stepping up to support it. We'll continue building our unique thing and I'm glad to see the industry moving towards products that we find here. By far, the most important growth of consumers for us comes from our merchant partners. I think they've just -- we've said it before and I'll say it again. Our number 1 growth strategy is signing best, most popular, most successful merchants in delivering conversion and uplift for them so that they, and affirm can benefit together. So that's what we continue doing. Our growth is -- that budget is largely represented in our engineering budget, to put it in financial terms, perhaps. You'll see us step out a little bit of our comfort zone. That is to say, it was never done, a national -- regional marketing campaign and . Very uncomfortable territory for me, maybe 3 or 4 years ago, something that we had to learn a couple years ago. And now look at us, we're taking out pretty things like TV commercials.  And so, you'll see us do more of that. That is fundamentally about teaching the end consumer that BNPL is here. It's important half of Americans we surveyed and we do survey all time have now expressed interest in using products like ours and the other half doesn't know what it is, which means that it's on us to educate the market and explain what this is and how it's fundamentally different from your credit card. It's less scary much more on your side. And then within that narrative how Affirm is unique in the sense that we don't charge late fees, we could do nasty things like deferred interest and all the various other gimmicks.  And so that is something that we'll continue doing, and one thing that we've learned in the context of understanding how to tell our own story, perhaps where we learn it, is as we got larger, more sophisticated, we partnered with a huge number of our merchants, in particular, our enterprise partners to promote our product in the context of their offerings. If you look at Affirm 5, 6 years ago, the idea of saying, hey, here's a really compelling bill, could be in a bicycle or a coach, or an article of clothing. Right now, pay later is something that you will see from a bike vendor, something that I might encounter in by my spare time.  Brew now, pay later is another line I've seen recently. We tend to have a lot of our partners in the coffee space given my personal election (ph),  equipment. As we learn how to drive these consumer messages which are -- we learn a lot about marketing, we also understood how to leverage the channel that our merchants have that are natural and native to them, how we can put both our intelligence and technology and dollars to work there. So always kept equal, you will see us do even more of that because we found this to be very efficient. I would not expect us to flunk really and develop into things like digital acquisition or mail drops, or anything, so the standard behaviors in the industry. I was literally bracing myself for you to say something like, and then I got declined or something like that. I'm glad I use my Debit+ 4 to 5 times a day and I haven't been the declined since the early alpha, but I'm still in the nightmare of being declined for a card swipe, comes to me from my teenage years, and also in the canals of Affirm's history. So, it's hard to decide whether the pretty overwhelmingly positive support for Debit+ that we've gotten from our users is more or less than we expected. We ran another email to our entire unit base saying, hey, Debit+ is actually real.  If you're on a waiting list, sit tight it's coming, and if you're not on the waiting list, maybe you should. And then it moved the waiting list itself grew by another double-digit percentage is just going to string the single announcement within our own user base. So, we're going against the 0 cards, 1 year ago, so it will be infinite growth no matter how we slice it. So, I think it'll be great asking again in a few quarters how well we're doing. But all signs\u2019 points to it will be good, but I will channel my inner Michael, say, put your Excel spreadsheet down and forecast nothing. We will not know what this thing will look like for a while.  We're not budgeting any volume, any revenue in. It's a product that we're bringing out there because -- it's unique. There's really nothing like it out there forecasting into the full there. We think it's awesome. I literally swiped my card buying a bag of beans yesterday and the guy next to me in line said, whoa, that was so focus. First, on purpose, I split a transaction right in front of them on my phone and it's like, whoa man, what was that? And so, when we have a few millions of those happening, I'll be able to forecast how many more we'll have. Actually, Can I ask you a question? Are you liking the card? Do you like the card, do you like the user experience? Nice. Excellent. If you're on the 1099 version, which may or may not have been pushed to you yet, you'll see like a Forex improvement in the loading speed of a transaction list on the prompting. It's really embarrassing what it was until the 1099. But once you get to 11, it'll be super-fast. Sorry. Customer research moment."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Thanks, Max. And good afternoon, everyone. Our Q1 results demonstrate the powerful impacts that our team and our investments in technology are having on our business. But before I get into the results for the quarter, I want to share some details about our expanded agreement with Amazon. Although we just announced our original relationship with Amazon at the end of August, the results we've seen have enabled us to expand beyond our task that began earlier this year. We are now ramping towards general availability, which we expect to achieve by the end of the calendar year. Our expanded agreement makes Affirm the only credit card alternative in the  space in the United States through January 2023. We are also excited to announce that Affirm will be embedded as a payment method in Amazon Pay at all eligible U.S. merchants. The initial term of our amended agreement will go through January 2025.  Together with a team at Amazon, we crafted an agreement that aligns our interest with equity grants tied to our growth. Amazon will receive an initial grant of 1 million penny warrant, and an additional 6 million that vest over the initial term of the contract, when certain performance conditions are met. Given the Amazon's massive consumer base, we expect this partnership to help create a step change in our network's scale. To ensure continued alignment on that goal, Amazon has the opportunity to vest up to an additional 15 million warrants with a $100 strike price tied to the scale up of our user network over the next 7 years. We're excited to deepen our relationships with Amazon to deliver an exceptional consumer experience while delivering shareholder value.  This deal is another proof point in our leadership as the enterprise partner of choice. Enterprises pick Affirm because we are the technology leader. And now, we have integrated relationships with partners representing approximately 60% of U.S. e-commerce. This is a big win, and we are just getting started. Now, let me turn to the quarter's results. Looking at the big picture, we continue to expand our two-sided network while delivering strong top-line growth and industry-leading unit economics. Zooming in, we scaled both our consumer and merchant networks dramatically, growing active consumers by 124% to 8.7 million, and increasing active merchants to a staggering 102,000 from just 6,500 a year ago. GMV grew 84% and revenue grew 55%, both ahead of our outlook. Excluding our largest merchant, that growth was even stronger.  GMV grew 138% and revenue increased 99%. That top-line growth generated strong unit economics, with revenue less transaction costs up 103% to $112 million or 4.1% of GMV, a 38 basis-point increase. Even as we significantly grew our network, we also improved our capital efficiency, demonstrating our disciplined approach to scaling. The equity capital we used to fund our loans decreased on a dollar basis by 36% from last year to just $140 million, representing less than 3% of our $5 billion total platform portfolio. Given our strategic progress in strong Q1 results, we have raised our outlook for GMV, revenue, and revenue less transaction costs for Fiscal Year '22, which I will discuss in detail in a moment.  Before I do that, let's walk through the results. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons refer to our first fiscal quarter of '22, versus Q1 at Fiscal '21. Active consumers increased 124% to $8.7 million, which corresponds to a $1.6 million sequential increase from Q4. And over the past 2 quarters, we have added 3.3 million net new consumers to our network. One of the key drivers of the strong Q1 performance was the ramp of our partnership with Shopify, which has enabled merchants to provide consumers with a fast, seamless pay-over-time product. After making Shop Pay Installments widely available in June, we have worked closely with Shopify to drive merchant uptake and consumer adoption.  As part of that effort, in the first quarter, we ran a limited time promotion for Shopify merchants to demonstrate the impact of Shop Pay Installments. The success of that promotion and the ramp of our partnership accelerated the growth of our network. While Shopify was a significant driver of user growth, we also experienced broad-base adoption across other merchants and categories. Our recently acquired Paybright in returning businesses also contributed a combined 120,000 new consumers sequentially from Q4 and 1.3 million from last year. Our partnership with Shopify also drove more than a 15-time increase in active merchants from 6,500 in the prior year to more than 102,000 in Q1. On a sequential basis, active merchants, which is calculated over a 12 -- trailing 12-month time frame, grew 3.5 times from the June-ending quarter.  While a relatively small impact to growth, I would also note that Paybright in return, we added about 2,600 incremental merchants. Moving to GMV, we grew GMV 84% in our first quarter to over $2.7 billion, exceeding our outlook. This growth reflects traction across all products and verticals and our ability to serve a diverse set of merchants and consumers across a wide set of transaction types and sizes. Importantly, our strong growth reflects not only the new merchant partnerships we've signed, but also the deep partnerships we are forging with our existing merchants. Excluding our largest merchant, our GMV with merchants that have been on Affirm's platform for 12 months or longer grew 70%, reflecting an increased share cart within this group of merchants.  We delivered triple-digit GMV growth in several categories. Our travel business grew 8-fold from last year's suppressed baseline, reaching a new high watermark. Our strong position among broad line retailers, including Walmart and Target, drove a 170% increase in GMV for this category compared to last year. The apparel category also remained a real bright spot, growing 128% year-over-year, which in our view shows the value of strong low AOV offerings when paired with high AOV products. To sum it up, the quality, depth, and breadth of our merchant partners, as well as our ability to address a wider range of transaction types, are key areas of strength for Affirm and their delivering results. In addition to helping our integrated merchant partners drive conversion, our direct-to-consumer virtual card product also delivered triple-digit growth, growing 119%, demonstrating strong adoption of our offerings, particularly among returning consumers.  We had a strong quarter outside the U.S. as our Canadian business added over $100 million of GMV. We serve a wide range of merchants and large enterprises in Canada, including Apple, which launched in the first quarter and has exceeded our expectations to date. Beyond Canada, we see a great opportunity to expand internationally by bringing our products to more of the regions that our merchant partners serve. As part of that strategy, we are excited to deepen our relationship with Peloton by launching in Australia. Our business with Peloton globally remains strong in the first quarter, with GMV more than doubling, compared to the more normal quarter ending September 2019.  As a reminder, in late calendar year 2020, Peloton transitioned to capturing transactions upon shipment versus authorization, which makes our Peloton GMV comparison skewed through the first half of our fiscal '22. Peloton 's concentration declined to 8% of our GMV this quarter, compared to 29% in the year ago quarter. And given our strong broad-based growth, no other merchant partner accounted for more than 5% of our GMV. While we are still in the early stages of our partnership with Shopify, we are already seeing some of the trends associated with the rapid growth of our split pay offering which currently power Shop Pay Installments. First growth in lower AOV categories has accelerated, resulting in an expected AOV decline from $661 one year ago to $402 in Q1.  Additionally, we are seeing continued growth in frequency, as transactions for active consumer rose 8% to approximately 2.3%. Finally, we expect the growth in our slip pay business which has a generally lower merchant discount rate than our 0% APR business strive lower total revenue yield as a percentage of GMV, albeit with lower total transaction costs once we reach scale. Now turning to the financials. The strength in GMV helped us deliver strong Q1 revenue growth. Net revenue of $269 million grew 55% year-over-year, and also exceeded our Q1 outlook. Total network Revenue grew 13%, but that figure masks much stronger underlying results. Excluding merchant fees earned from our largest merchant partner in Q1. Total revenue growth was 99% and total network revenue growth was 81%.  As a percentage of GMV, revenue was 10%, consistent with our outlook. The 190-basis point decline from last year was driven by the mix shift away from longer duration, 0% APR loans. On the expense side, we achieved significant leverage on transaction costs. Total transaction costs of $157 million grew 33% year-over-year, compared to revenue growth at 55%. With the mix shift I described a moment ago, loss on loan purchase commitment declined 22% while improvements in our Capital program limited the growth of funding costs to 62%, despite growing liabilities we used to fund our loans by 76%. Provision for credit losses grew at 120%, driven by the provision releases in the comparable period, but also reflecting the credit loosening initiated earlier this year.  Our credit outlook and position remain the same as we described in our investor forum. We expect to continue to see the impact of credit loosening, resulting in intentionally higher allowances, which in turn drive provisions for credit losses in each period. The robust top-line growth and leverage and transaction costs resulted in higher revenue, less transaction costs, which grew 103% to $112 million or 4.1% of GMV. With the strong growth in unit economics, as well as the massive opportunities we see, we are continuing to invest for the long term.  As Max discussed, in Q1, we continued to invest in building our team. We were also investing in marketing to build our brand and scale our network. This resulted in higher personnel costs and stock-based compensation in technology and data analytics, as well as sales and marketing. In Q1, total operating expenses outside of transaction costs, grew $190 million, driven by an $87 million increase in stock-based compensation, primarily due to the IPO in January. Excluding SBC, these expenses grew 125%. GAAP operating loss was $166 million compared to a loss of $33 million last year. Adjusted operating loss was $45 million in the quarter compared to an $8 million loss in the prior year.  Turning to our balance sheet, we delivered another strong quarter of GMV growth while continuing to drive greater efficiency from a capital perspective. Total platform portfolio grew from $3 billion to $5 billion at the end of Q1 and we increased our overall funding capacity from $4.2 billion last year to $7.3 billion. Our disciplined approach also drove a reduction in the equity capital we used to fund our business from $220 million to just $140 million despite growing our loans in the balance Sheet by more than $800 million year-over-year. Accordingly, as a percentage of total platform portfolio, Equity Capital Required fell to an all-time low of 3% from 8% last year.  Now, looking to the year ahead, we expect the strategic progress we've made in fiscal Q1, as well as the strength we are experiencing in consumer and merchant adoption to help drive even stronger results for fiscal '22. Accordingly, we are raising our outlook for the year. We now expect GMV to increase between 58% and 61% from fiscal year '21, to between $13.13 billion to $13.38 billion. We expect revenue of $1.225 to $1.250 billion representing year-over-year growth of 41% to 44%. We expect transaction costs of $645 to $655 million resulting in revenue less transaction costs of $580 to $595 million. Finally, we expect an adjusted operating loss as a percentage of total revenue up 12% to 14% as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business. We expect weighted average shares of approximately $290 million for the year, consistent with our prior outlook.  While these financial results do not include the benefit of our recently signed partnership Amazon, we have included the impact of any warrants previously mentioned with $1 million vesting upon signing and $6 million vesting quarterly over the three-year contractual period. And given the same trends, we are also raising our outlook for our second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021. We now expect GMV to grow 71% to 76% to $3.55 to $3.65 billion, total revenue of $320 to $330 million, total transaction costs of $143 million to $148 million, revenue less transaction costs of $178 million to $183 million, adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 5% to 7%, and weighted average shares outstanding of $285 million. In closing, I want to add my thanks to the Affirmers who helped deliver such strong results. Our team is the best part of my job here, and their continued ingenuity and hard work enable us to impact the lives of millions of consumers. Max and I will now open up the line for questions. So again, consistent with as we talked about it at the Investor Forum, we ran the business at a very tight level coming out of COVID and have been on a path, over the past year, of slowly relaxing in the credit box. We've also seen the impact of mix in our business that would show up as well, but the governor for us is always that, revenue less transaction costs. We think about credit as a thing that we control and choose, not something that happens to us. That being said, we're generally very conservative in how we think about provisioning and the allowance that we maintain. We always want to be careful here and we do expect that some of that conservatism may show up in the Q2 guidance we've given for revenue less transaction costs. Where we do think that we're probably on the more conservative end of the allowance, as we sit here today. Thank you. So, I think we are the sole h by  partner through Gen 23. That's important and powerful. Our last 8-k, I think said very So, explicitly, this is a non-exclusive pilot so the most important quality to change here is Amazon had their pick obviously in partners in the space. They tested us. We pass the test. We passed with flying colors and better. And so, I think that's a very important qualitative matter here. The Amazon Pay and setting is new. That was not in the last conversation which is important so we said it before and I'll say it again. Yes, the warrants are new, meaning it's an important piece of aligning incentives. If you think about the posture of the relationship, you're dealing with someone as large and within much scale as Amazon, it's a good thing to have them invest it in the outcomes that are good for you and that's how we thought about it as we worked on that amendment. In terms of why not have it in the forecast, yes, it's exactly right. Our approach to building forecasts and giving guidance is we need to see it before we commit to it. We're just now beginning the process of fully ramping this out to. Over the next couple of weeks and then throughout the rest of the holiday season we'll have a pretty good read and be prepared to give you some pretty clear guidance coming into the next quarter. I would just add on the call to your comment that we're not yet fully optimized there. We're really excited with the traction that we are seeing, but there's a lot of work left to do. I think that we've got many precedence here as we think about enterprise ramps. They don't happen in weeks and months, they happen in quarters, and oftentimes even years. That's the horizon with which we're investing effort to optimize this program. So, we think there's still a lot of work to do and we're definitely not near the peak. Yeah. On your first question, the product that is currently live on Amazon.com is an interest-bearing product which is skewed towards consumer monetization. Although of course, we will monetize that either by keeping on the balance sheet or selling it to capital partners on a 4-12 basis. And so won't necessarily hit the interest income line on the income statement. That's the part of life today. However, we have the opportunity and desires to eventually broaden the whole portfolio for Amazon.com But also importantly, with inside of Amazon Pay where that relationship is going to start with a wide set of products. As for the questions around the nature of our unique relationship, we are not obligated to not serve any partner. We generally don't agree to that any context. I think it's very important for our network to remain open. Yeah. We're not going to update any forward-looking number for Peloton, except to say that the Q1 results for us on Peloton did exceed our internal estimates, and there's certainly nothing that we've seen to suggest that we should be changing our outlook overall in light of where that business is at. We're not updating the guide for that number, but what we will say is that in Q1 we were right in the middle of that range for split Pay offering. Then I just wanted to touch upon Debit+. I was one of the lucky ones to be a part of the beta program. I noticed that that program is upwards of 0.5 million people now. I thought that number was ultimately going to be a little bit less before the end of the year. Should we take that as an indication of stronger demand for Debit+ than when you had originally anticipated or is there some other variable a that we should be considering? So, sit back and enjoy the experience. Your first question first. We grew total platform portfolio by about $2 billion. We added about $820 million on the Balance Sheet, made up of about 100 -- or of $1.1 billion that we securitized on the Balance Sheet, and about $250 million reduction in the warehouse funding, which is probably a little bit tighter even than we'd like to run it, that's what drove the really efficient equity capital required number that we posted this quarter. And of course, the rest of it grew off the Balance Sheet with the biggest piece being forward flow. I think that strategy is going to continue to be in play.  Today, we closed another zero-coupon securitization, or 0% financing programs or securitization and continue to have real success in that market despite the rate movements and the loosening of the credit box, so we're not convinced that we're going to have a real struggle there. And yet, as we've always discussed, our approach to capital is to ensure that we've got multiple sources to fund the business and we're not going to be wed to any one funding model or lever and continue to invest in growing capacity across all of our funding types. I certainly appreciate the too much  problem. Our capital team works really hard to ensure that we've cut adequate capacity. They wake up every day ensuring that we can fund the business. Today our deposits are held by cause of a bank, and not outsourced funding for the business. But we will always keep an eye on other alternative methods as we scale this business at a pretty rapid clip."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. Welcome to the Affirm Holdings Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. Following the speakers\u2019 remarks, we will open the line for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nZane Keller: Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which is -- which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them, except as required by law. In addition, today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings supplement slide deck, which is available on our Investor Relations website. Hosting today's call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm Chief Financial Officer. In line with our practice in prior quarters, we will begin with brief opening remarks from Max before proceeding immediately into Q&A. On that note, I will turn the call over to Max to begin. Max?\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. Thanks, everyone, for joining, and I hope you've had a chance to read our quarterly letter as it includes lots of great information. I mentioned in the letter, we're very proud of the team's accomplishments this quarter, closing out the fiscal year on a high note. In our fiscal Q4, we exceeded our outlook across all key metrics were profitable on an adjusted operating income basis, improved our already great credit metrics while accelerating growth and launched with some amazing brands on the platform. Some of these brands are so cool, we can't even say their names. You just have to go shopping to find them. Dear to my product developing heart, we're finally able to brag about the Affirm Cards progress. We're energized by the momentum we're seeing and are investing significant energy into making the card the top of wallet choice for our consumers. We also expect to deliver annual profitability on an adjusted operating income basis going forward. and our disciplined performance over the last several quarters has earned us the right to return to a more aggressive pace of network growth while maintaining discipline. I tried hard to make my letter a breathy read this quarter, so I hope you have a chance to peruse it, if you haven't yet. For a deeper dive into our numbers, please have a look at the one from Michael. He's a good man and thorough. But in case, you would like even more investor information about Affirm, we're pleased to announce that we will be holding an investor forum on November 14 in New York. At the event, you will hear from several of our management team members, and we will provide an update on our commercial and product initiatives as well as our financial framework. Please look for additional information, including registration details on our Investor Relations website as we get closer to the event. Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller: Thank you, Max. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Again, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thank you for the introduction there and looking forward to the Investor Day. Max, I believe you were just saying around the right to reaccelerate investment. I just want to make sure I have this right, though, in terms of what's implied to the guide for the upcoming year. If we take the GMV guide and the ROTC as a percentage of GMV and think about the 2% operating margin, it seems to imply that there's only sort of a low-single digit growth in your OpEx base for this year. One, is that investment under the hood with some savings elsewhere and maybe just provide a little added context around that, it seems to imply not a whole lot of expense growth.\nMax Levchin: That is accurate. Some sort of a lean and mean code writing machine joke (ph) comes to mind, but I'm not capable of those, but we have been more productive than perhaps ever in our history over the last six months or so? Certainly last three, we\u2019ve really just built a lot of great stuff, and we have no intention of slowing down, looking for efficiencies.\nTim Chiodo: Okay. Thank you for the confirmation. Appreciate it.\nMax Levchin: You are correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question this evening. You guys called out growing merchants at a good year-over-year clip and also some new partner signings and expansions. Can you give us an -- your updated thought on the growth algorithm of the business in terms of what you're expecting from existing customers versus new logos and maybe there's a new category, which is sort of product now that Affirm Holdings Card seems to be inflecting. How should we think about those three forces kind of what's more important to drive growth going forward?\nMax Levchin: It's a great question. Thank you, as always. So that should be already apparent in some of the writing we did the highest efficiency way for us to grow kind of what constitutes the existing business is growth through and with our platform partners. And that's where we really can invest the way we know how to do our best work, building products, building features, figuring out how to partner holistically across very, very large surface areas, Shopify, Walmart, et cetera., that's where kind of high, high leverage for every line of code, you get some number of billions dollars or something like that. That's the growth vector for the existing business. You saw the sort of near vertical line we're seeing in the sign-ups with the card, but it's coming from a tiny base. And so at some point, it's going to be -- at this point, I can say that with some amount of confidence, a massive business for us, and we have all the confidence and all the investment to back that confidence up. But in the very immediate future, majority of the growth of GMV will certainly come from existing partnerships with platforms. We're still quite actively signing up new merchants. We're still figuring out ways of expanding programs with those merchants but differently, expanding our share of card with them. But that's roughly the order where we concentrate our energy [indiscernible] my time is largely spent figuring out what next five moves. So the card looks like, I think the core business is a fairly well-oiled machine. We've got some extraordinary partners. We've done well for them. They're quite happy with how we're doing together and we'll continue doing lots of great work there, too.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. Really quick follow-up for me. Are you worried or what do you expect from the student loan repayment restarting coming up here? There's been a little bit of media but, I'm just curious what your view is in terms of how that would impact the credit environment in the U.S.?\nMax Levchin: So we've included that in our forecast. So we don't expect it to be something that just happened to a different Galaxy. We expect it to be a modest headwind for us or at least we're prepared for that, and it's priced in, if you will, to our numbers. I have to give a little bit of credit where it's due. I read Mizuho, Dan Dolev's colleagues wrote a nice piece describing what they think will happen to BNPL industry I the student loan repayment restarts. And I won\u2019t comment on exact numbers, but I have to say directionally, we\u2019re in agreement with what they found in the research. So I think it\u2019s a good place to look for thoughts on that. But we don\u2019t think it\u2019s nothing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s very significant either.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nRayna Kumar: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question and good quarter. I just want to ask you about your loan delinquency rate, it came in better than expected in the fourth quarter. You saw a sequential decline in 3Q versus 4Q. What makes you think that there will be an increase in the first half in '24.\nMax Levchin: Seasonality. We know our borrower as well. We know when they have improvements to their personal cash flow, and we know when they struggle a little bit, and we are kind to be in front of that. But it's -- credit is always job number one. We're in control of what's happened and what will happen.\nRayna Kumar: Got it. Okay. And then I just want to ask you about the CFPB and the credit reporting bureaus They, of course, continue to push for greater reporting of purchases financed through the NPL. And you've been a proponent of greater reporting transparency. But this could also be at odds with your strategy of increasing the frequency and usage of your financing solutions. Do you think greater credit reporting will drive down consumer usage of NPL or if you can just talk about your thoughts on that. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Three (ph) question. Obviously, we're strongly engaged with CFPB. We consider them to be our regulator because we are financial services company of scale. And I happen to -- and my team as well happens to believe that credit reporting is a really important piece of the puzzle. We want to make sure that consumers benefit, those that pay us back on time anyway, from their timely repayment in their credit reporting. Part of the work we have done and will do with the bureaus and with our competitors and peers in the industry is actually making sure that the way this is reported is reflective of the factual usage of the product of course, but also does not unduly punish or reward consumers through [indiscernible] idiosyncratic sort of outcomes of the scores. But part of why the NPL world does not like to report to the bureaus, the original scoring systems used by the bureaus, their own or their Issac ones don't really correctly account for what these loans look like just to share multitude of them. And so part of the work we\u2019re doing with the industry and the bureaus is to make sure that it works the right way for a young customer.\nRayna Kumar: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Hey, Max. Thanks. Appreciate it. Amazing results here. I can't get more excited about the Affirm cards, Debit+. My only question is, can you maybe give us the main building blocks for the 2024 guide? So what are you incorporating in terms of Debit+ what should we know like? Can you maybe give us like a little path of like a bridge of how we can think about 2024 with all the puts and takes. Again, great results. Thank you.\nMichael Linford: Yeah. Thanks, I'll grab that one, and Max, feel free to add anything. I think for the full year, we've put out what we think is the floor will exceed $24 billion in GMV. And that really reflects some uncertainty around where the ceiling is driven in part by things like the Affirm card. The Affirm Card is very early. The charts that we have in our letter showed that kind of steep inflection and early trajectory, which is really exciting, but we're not sure where and when we get to anything that approximates us a peak there. With respect to the margin structure in the business, we would expect to see some -- obviously, the full year impact of a higher rate environment. If you remember, the course of last fiscal year is as rates were constantly rising. And we're at or near the higher end of that rate cycle and would expect that to play out with respect to some headwinds in the cost side. And to offset that, of course, we have some of our consumer pricing initiatives, which will begin to bear real fruit. And all of that is kind of in the top line part of the business. And then with respect to operating expenses, we do expect the full year benefit of the restructuring actions that we took earlier this year, enabling us to deliver what we think will be a profitable year on an adjusted operating income basis.\nDan Dolev: Got it. And can I squeeze one more in. Shopify is pretty bold up on the in-store experience. Are you seeing any of that in the new initiatives?\nMax Levchin: It's there. It's certainly not fully rolled out yet, but it's definitely something that Shopify is very committed to and as a good partner with so are we. So we have lots of work to do there. I've said many times before, in store is the next frontier. I think frequency is the single most important thing we can focus on in terms of building out the network and most people still shop in stores, at least as much as online or more like 4 times more. And so being offline is really important. That was a great opportunity. We're scaling that up with them.\nDan Dolev: Yeah. Great results. Thanks again.\nMax Levchin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to just ask a follow-up question on acceptance and merchants. It seems like in the current environment with interest rates now quite a bit higher than they were just even a year ago that it would be a good opportunity for merchants to find up places where they could use zero percent promotions and in conjunction with Affirm to help drive volumes, so without having to resort to product discounting, et cetera. So I'm just wondering kind of what your engagement is like with merchants and what is the opportunity to further drive Affirm acceptance and use through some of those promotional activities.\nMax Levchin: Certainly, the right estimation, there are plenty of merchants who are focused on driving their top line. I mean, I think this tends to come up in our conversations on and off. But basically, if you're a fully integrated merchant with a healthy gross margin, then the best way in my bias opinion to protect your price and perception of your prices with consumers is to use Affirm zero percent deals or fixed APR deals at this point, support much more than just zero percent. There's lots and lots of different promotional offerings that we've constructed for our various partners. So we see great interest in that with plenty of merchants who are resellers and they're fairly far down the supply chain, they do not have the margin to support zeros, and it's difficult for them. Sometimes, we're able to bring in manufacturers of the original equipment or the original items and they step in and create zero percent deals, and we have a healthy number of those and have a lot of plans to expand that. But generally speaking, you're exactly right. There's plenty of worry by merchants to keep moving the merchandise they need to discount, discounting kills price integrity and we're here to help.\nJames Faucette: Thank you. And then on RLTC, it seems like it was good to see that margin, particularly on Debit+ and the ramp you're seeing obviously. How should we think about the mix between interest-bearing or pay now or plan for on more of a medium-term basis for that product?\nMax Levchin: That's a great question. So for the moment, I am personally a little bit [indiscernible] in a sense that we are not quite done improving the frequency. So my goal or the company's goal, the team's goal anyway is to make Affirm card the top of wallet pursing (ph) device, which means that whatever your percentage of paying out transactions is, I want them all and whatever you might put in your credit card, I want you to put on the Debit+ flash Affirm card. So for the moment that sits at 42% pay now or something like that, and the rest is both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing. The really cool footnote in the non-paying out part of this is that we are in control of which one you choose. We are the ones presenting a modified version of Adaptive checkout, both before and after the swipe wherever you decide to go in terms of borrowing. And so we have a lot of control over where you're seeing 0s and we're not seeing 0s and depends very much on the merchant contracts and promotional activities we have with them. But in terms of the target pay now versus not, we'll start reporting on those once we get to a certain level of scale, but at the moment, more of each kind is better.\nMichael Linford: The other thing I add just to be really clear, the 42% stat, and we break it out in our shareholder letter, that's on a transaction basis. We would continue to expect the AOVs of pay now to be substantially lower than the interest-bearing transaction, which means on a GMV basis, the mix would be much lower in terms of percentage of pay now.\nJames Faucette: Okay. Great. Thanks for that, Michael and great color there Max. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eugene Simoni with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nEugene Simuni: Thank you very much. Hi, guys. Wanted to ask about GMV growth. It looks like it came in better than expected this quarter at 25% year-over-year. So it would be very helpful to hear what are some of the factors that helped it grow faster whether it's macro or kind of Affirm specific? And then as a follow-up, does that -- would love to hear a bit on how you thought about your GMV guide for next year because I realize that $24 billion is the floor but that floor, if I'm doing the math correctly, implies a deceleration from that level. So why would you not be able to achieve the growth rate that you achieved this quarter with GMV next year?\nMichael Linford: Yes. So in terms of the fourth quarter, we saw a lot of traction in our travel and ticketing business. You saw the consumer out participating in the economy in those sort of events driven, experiential driven spending patterns. And because of our breadth of distribution there, we were real beneficiaries of that this quarter. We also have done a lot of work to continue to optimize the checkout experience so that we can increase both uptake and our ability to capture volume on those channels and others. And we continue to ramp our largest enterprise platform partnerships as well. Those were big growers for us this quarter, and many of them were even accelerating their growth. So being positioned correctly and distributed correctly at the right parts of the economy, I think definitely benefited us a lot as well as work we've done on our side in terms of product. In terms of forward-looking into the year, I think there's clearly a lot of optimism internally for where we're taking the business and the things that we're working on, and we're just mindful of the economic volatility that continues to persist. And so we're starting the year off with a thoughtful approach here and making sure we don't sign up for more than we know we will deliver. I think the deceleration point, I think that we would expect there to be -- as we continue to scale some of our largest platforms slightly lower growth rate as we do achieve something that looks more like a normalized distribution or penetration on those largest platforms. And yet on the other side, we do have a lot of upside in our direct-to-consumer business. And how those two factors play out is something that will keep you in the loop on throughout the course of this fiscal year.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And then if I can squeeze in just one more on -- related to uncertainty and economic environment next year. I don't know if I missed it, but what is your assumption about unemployment rate for next year just because it's such an important driver of credit as you often point out.\nMax Levchin: We more than anything benefit from the fact that our terms are short and controllable by us and we price and underwrite every transaction individually. I think if we were in the business of issuing lines, we would have to have an internal economic bureau trying to predict what unemployment looks like six quarters from now because the lines we would have granted today would still be getting utilized or repaid then. And instead, we have the benefit of saying we don't like the latest unemployment imprint, and therefore, we're going to change our credit posture. The way we achieve the results that we are bragging about today in credit has nothing to do with our ability to see the future. We never knew what unemployment would be. We never knew it would be better or worse, but that's just not how this business works. We have the controls to react to literally daily outcomes of our credit monitoring and whatever the future brings, we will adjust to that future. So our assumptions are, we will continue diligence being diligent. We\u2019re going to continue meeting. Every Monday morning the entire executive team looks at all the credit results and ask the question, is everything great or do we need to do something. So I don\u2019t have a promise or a progesterification on unemployment, but I can assure you that whatever the number will be, we\u2019ll be ready for it.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Perlin: Thanks. I had a question on the Affirm card, Max. In the description here, you're talking about how it works. And I just want to make sure I'm clear on this. And the question really is around early readings and what you're seeing in terms of engagement and frequency of views. So on one hand, you talk about consumers can request a payment plan in the app before checking out. And then you say, it were linked to the bank account to pay with Affirm card and then have a post decision kind of post swipe, post tap. So when we think about those two types of consumer experiences, what's the early -- I would imagine linking it to the bank account creates more of a habitual frequency, but I'd be interested to know what you're seeing early stage? And is there a way to, I guess, I don't know, incentivize the consumer to go in one of those directions that would be beneficial both to you but also not detrimental to them. Thanks.\nMax Levchin: I don't know if there's a question in that, that was eloquently put and pretty much accurate. You're on the dot on everything you just said. So you're exactly right, the way the product works. And I'll break it down for like a couple of minutes just to be super clear for everybody. So you sign up for the Affirm card, you get one in the mail. You don't have to do very much work at all. If you are Affirm user you are eligible to use Affirm card, and it's basically literally an Affirm card you request a loan and then you swipe the card or you chip it and the next transaction becomes that loan. So simple as that. It is absolutely much better for us and for our users if you connect your bank account because then you can swipe and if you didn't bother asking for a loan, you can still do it ex-post facto. And if you have nothing, it becomes a pay now transaction that settles. And so it's basically this journey from, I like Affirm, I use Affirm, now I can use it in store, nothing new to learn. As soon as you get a card in the mail, it is our job, and this is exactly where I'm spending the most recent conversation I had about what we call the first user experience was sometime between 1 and 2 o\u2019clock morning in last night. So what I spend my time on is making sure that, that conversion from Affirm card for my well understood part of the Affirm experience to, I can connect to my bank account and get access to all these amazing features. Of course, I want to do that. So that is where we're spending lots and lots of cycles right now. It's going really well. I don't want to get into exact numbers, but where we started and where we ended is a massive progress, and we're very, very far from done. The economics improve, our ability to underwrite improves because we get to see your cash flow, our ability to offer you interesting access to things like zero percent loans improves because we understand the economics a little better and just see frequently high engagement. Therefore, we can make more educated bets around lifetime value over consumers. So everything you said is pretty spot. Let's see if there's anything else I can share on this topic. Both the frequency and the amounts and the LTV, like every metric possibly imagined is better once the card becomes fully fledged. We have internal terminology, specifically describing the sort of unconnected and connected state of the card exactly because it's such an important thing. And yes, we can absolutely low incentives, and we have a lot of good results that show that the incentives are not going to be especially expensive at all.\nDaniel Perlin: That\u2019s excellent. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.\nA \u2013 Max Levchin: If no one can tell I\u2019m excited by this product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Keane: Hey, guys. Max, you're going to be excited because I'm going to ask you more questions about the Affirm card. So the active consumer base, I think, spiked in the quarter. I think it's north of 200,000. I remember we had a wait list of about 1 million or so. I'm just trying to figure out, is there another big change of growth that we expect or kind of the users will be more modest growth from this level? Just trying to figure out how big that wait list is? And is there a big rollout to consumers happening as we speak.\nMax Levchin: So for what it's worth the wait list included everyone that wanted the Affirm card does not -- the current active base does not necessarily include everyone who wants one because we were very, very careful as we rolled it out in terms of credit standards. In general, while I am gushing here over this amazing product that we finally rolled out and doing really well with. On the other side of that equation is a super sort of Spartan view of credit. We cannot afford to screw that up. And so we're not going to, therefore, launching a brand-new product without a very clear understanding of exactly what repayment will look like to everyone who wants it. It's probably not a good idea, and that's certainly not what we did. But the demand for the card was and is, very, very significant. We're not yet pushing it. In fact, there's a healthy internal debate as to the level of insistence we should take with our users. So there's a couple of million users that we consider to be sort of fully in on the affirmed story. They use us online. They use us at the point of sale, they use the virtual card number, which is like at this point, you can say it's kind of diminished Affirm card experience. And so that group, I have pretty high confidence once the card, would love the card, we can push fairly hard to get them all on it. We have not done that yet, just judging by the numbers. And we reserve the right to do just so. That said, there's plenty of other users that don't understand Affirm as well as we want them to, and they're eligible, and some of them are signing up for the card already. And so there's still lots of work to do on first user experience. We know, for example, I think I mentioned it in the last call, but the sort of the learning curve to date looks something like this. If you do one transaction, you are not guaranteed to stay with us forever. Once you do two transactions that you're basically in and after three transactions, you start reading the card as a sort of integral part of your purchasing experience. And so our goal is to both reduce the level of complexity that it takes to get our users through to understand this as well as guide them to that third transaction to just ensure that they fully grasp it. And we'll continue hammering on that. I expect a few more releases to go by before we feel very satisfied. And at that point, we can push the gas paddle and start basically telling people this is the only way to use Affirm at an unintegrated merchants, the only way to use Affirm offline, although those avenues are still open for a reason. Does that make sense?\nBryan Keane: Yeah. Got it. And so when you talk about this step function change or whenever that is, it's not built into the guidance, obviously. But when it happens, it's a lot of these things that you just talked about you have to feel comfortable with so that you can roll it out in mass and then obviously, the transaction volumes will continue. Just trying to figure out exactly when that step function happens where we go from these small numbers to, obviously, you think this could be pretty material. So just trying to figure out what to watch for.\nMax Levchin: We definitely think this can and will be material one day. I am definitely not telling you or anyone when exactly that will happen. There's still a lot of work to do. We are rolling it out, like at this point, it's available broadly. If you're eligible in your app, you will find an invitation to take out the Affirm card. What I said is that we're not yet saying -- like for example, when you tap on to the card tab in the app, if you've used Affirm virtual card number, you can still do so. Like, we will tell you, hey, by the way, you\u2019re eligible for the Affirm card, maybe you should grab it, but it\u2019s not the same thing of saying, you wanted to get to the Affirm onetime card, sorry, that deprecated you should use Affirm card that we\u2019ll send you in the mail. So those kind of steps haven\u2019t been taken yet. But we are ramping up like you can see it in the numbers, and we have \u2013 there are a number of things we\u2019re going to do, both as far as educating the end borrower to make sure that they understand how the debit card works. And we will definitely take a bunch of aggressive steps to make sure that everybody who is eligible for it understands exactly that they should come get it.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good afternoon. Appreciate taking the question. 4Q seemed like a really strong quarter from an enterprise customer standpoint. And it seems like from what we've seen perhaps Affirm even punched above its weight or well above sort of trended tender share on Prime Day. Max, can you just talk about your thought process around how much tender share you can ultimately gain at least in e-com at your enterprise customers and whether the fourth quarter might be a preview of things to come in terms of share and spend, hence, GMV growth?\nMax Levchin: Yes. We certainly like that, obviously. We are taking share of mind share of checkout share of wallet. So I feel very good about that. If you look at more mature BNPL markets, obviously, apples and oranges a little bit, but there are plenty of geos where buy now pay latter, broke into north of 10%, some places even north of 20%. In the U.S. online, I think, in aggregate, we're hanging around 5% or 6% last I looked, this is -- don't quote me on that exactly, but it's that order. If you look at full commerce, both online and offline, it's decidedly sub-1%. So in terms of 99% more to go, and it will probably grow lots before it slows down. It's always work. It's all of this is product work. Like, you don't get to deliver a brand new way to pay for things without customer education, without the right level of promotion in the funnel. So it's definitely not a thing that's going to happen overnight. But on the flip side, you're exactly right. I consider this quarter a preview of things to come. Like we really focused on the right way of bringing the product to the masses and it paid off.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Yeah. That's clear. As a follow-on for Michael, can you remind us when you lap the tighter credit box? I mean I know you reserved the right to sort of to change your underwriting on the slide, but assuming that you sort of maintain the current level of economic activity, when do we see growth perhaps benefit from that?\nMichael Linford: Yes. The timing initiatives that we took last year started in the early summer and through the early fall, so summer time to early fall. So we're kind of in the midst of lapping a lot of those actions. I would say by the time we get to our second quarter is when we have a pretty normalized comparison for the biggest changes. But I do think it's important to reiterate what you said there. We changed our credit decisions a lot all the time. So it's not a decision where we make -- get together when we decide to tighten or loosen in a pretty broad steeping way. We're very tactical and surgical with how we go through and optimize where and when we want to take risk. But the specific decisions that we took in response to the consumer stress that we saw, we will have lapped by the time we get through Q2.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Wildhack: Hi, guys. I wanted to unpack some of the earlier commentary on the margin. The guidance is for fiscal '24 revenues as a percentage of GMV to be similar to '23, '24 RLTC is the same as \u201823. That would imply transaction costs are also similar to '23 as a percentage of GMV. And then within that, I would assume funding costs are going to be higher. So a, is that right? And then b, is there something that's offsetting that on the cost side in terms of keeping overall transaction costs flat as a percentage of volume this year.\nMichael Linford: Yeah. It's exactly right. And we do expect funding costs to be higher, but we also have some continued changes in the mix of the business, both in terms of the largest platforms, we'll continue to take share, which will change the shape of the timing and how we earn it. The balance sheet will also be very different this year to last year. which again will change the shape quite a bit. There's a lot of different factors that caused that go into that, that assessment. But the top line is right. Those things will net out to being largely flat from a revenue standpoint and an RLTC standpoint as a percentage of GMV.\nRobert Wildhack: Got it. Thanks. Could you just give some more detail or color on what you mean by the balance sheet is going to be different from this year to next year?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. So you saw the loans on the balance sheet were obviously higher in Q4 versus the prior year and also up sequentially. We talked about an equity capital require ratio being higher as well. And we would expect there or there would be a lot more dollars sitting on the balance sheet this year than last year, which just changes the shape of the earning of the loans.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nReginald Smith: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I've got two actually. one, I guess, a point of clarification. I guess previously, you guys talked about sustainable profitability beginning in 2024. And I guess I just wanted to check the language and see if there's been any change to your guidance. Now you're talking about annually profitably. And I'm curious if that was always the expectation or is that a minor change?\nMichael Linford: No, it was always the expectation. We talked about sustainable profitability. We were always thoughtful around our second quarter being a time win. The timing of GMV within the quarter as well as the sequential build from Q1 to Q2, always being distortive. And so we're careful to say that, that may be a trough, and we reiterated that in our letter while we do expect full year profitability, we may have a quarter that may fall outside of that. Clearly, you see our Q1 guidance suggests that, that won't be in Q1 and the full year guidance being where it is, suggests, I think we're \u2013 certainly feel pretty good about that overall. But we won't be disappointed if we have a quarter of negative adjusted operating income.\nReginald Smith: Got it. Understood. And if I could squeeze one more follow-up. There is a slide that you guys have in your presentation that shows the merchant discount rate for different products. And it's hard to notice that the rate for year zero interest loans, both short and long term, hasn't changed materially in the last two years. And I'm curious if that's -- what's driving that? Is that -- is it a competitive dynamic? Is it strategic? Is it mix? Like why have you not been able to or have been unwilling to kind of raise your discount rates that given what's happening in the interest rate and the funding environment? Thanks.\nMichael Linford: Yes. It's a good question. The -- one of the things that is an important piece of backdrop as you have a rising rate environment, you've also had a lot of the retail sector having a lot of pressure on their margin structure. And so one of the challenges we've worked through over the past year is finding ways still serve as many transactions as we can for those retailers without substantial increases in their MDRs. And so for example, we've introduced fixed APRs, which have low fixed APR amounts that are still subsidized by the merchant, but don't look like the same sort of pure zero percent. And so as a result, you don't see by product a substantial increase in that even though we've changed the economic offer that ultimately the merchant consumer to get to see. Additionally, this view is super helpful to understand actually what the merchants are paying for a product. But it is into a complete view as we're able to think about changing down payment or credit approval thresholds, all these things factor into how we think about the total pricing with the merchant. And so you may not see the results of us getting the right value for Affirm that relationship showing up in the seat of the merchant pace.\nReginald Smith: Understood. And I guess, Max, you mentioned some higher gross margin merchants. And I think a previous analyst had asked about whether you're seeing any increased interest there. Is the right way to read that, that you guys haven't pushed on some of those higher margin merchants that may be a little less price-sensitive? Or like what's the takeaway from that?\nMax Levchin: So again, I think it's -- we have a market-leading product in a very competitive space that's really exciting and a lot of entrants into the space. I think we're very proud of the fact that we've been able to hold pricing in that competitive environment, macro notwithstanding, I think that we do think about the merchants being very different depending upon their margin structure, their promotional intensity and all that factors into how we think about what MDR is make sense. But again, I think MDR is only one small part of the total pricing equation, which is -- takes into account a lot more than just the MDR being paid because it's obviously, to take into account the cost of the program as well. And when you think about all of these together, we think about the profitability of a particular merchant, not just the MDR that they pay.\nReginald Smith: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to start with the guidance on RLTC as a percent of GMV for F '24. I know we're saying it's going to be similar. It's hard to be precise in this macro backdrop. But just want to get a sense of kind of range of outcomes. I mean, are we talking about 10-ish basis points or so on either side of the F '23 results or just trying to get a sense of how wide of a range you guys might be envisioning? Like do you think there's a wider range of outcomes in F '24 compared to the way you guided F '23 for example? Just wanted to get a little more detail on that. Thanks.\nMichael Linford: Good question. And the first part of your question is exactly right. I think that we're not giving a precise range because of the uncertainty and macroeconomic backdrop. I think that if you look at the range that we guided to in Q4, which we were ahead of, you can get a pretty good sense of the fact that we are sitting in a period where you're going to see a quarter-to-quarter variability. What is not in doubt in our eyes is continuing to stick within the 3% to 4% long-term framework we've put out there for revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of GMV. And what's nutting out is our ability to pull the right cost and revenue levers to choose that outcome when we talked about full year guidance as being things that were within our control, and we think this is one where we're going to be able to deliver. We're not going to get more specific than similar to last year right now.\nJason Kupferberg: Right. Okay. So I guess it kind of sounds like you see maybe a fairly similar probability of being a little better in F '24 than being a little worse in F '24 because I know similar could obviously mean in either direction. Is that kind of how it feels?\nMichael Linford: Yeah, it's exactly right. We're -- we feel like in this rate environment, the results that we delivered in '23 are representative of the results that we would like to deliver. That being said, of course, any given quarter can move around a non-trivial amount, but nonetheless, feel like similar to '23 is a good place to model the business.\nJason Kupferberg: Yeah. For sure. Just a quick one on Affirm card. I saw $130 million of GMV in Q4. What are you assuming in the Q1 and the full year guidance for the Affirm card GMV and will you disclose the Affirm card volumes each quarter going forward as you did this past quarter?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. We do intend to share the Affirm card GMV every quarter. We may not share all the same stats that we did this quarter as we get going. We do think it\u2019s important to communicate the total volume there. We\u2019re not going to give super precise numbers with respect to the Affirm card guidance for the year, but what we will say is there\u2019s a couple of points of growth that we think the card will drive.\nJason Kupferberg: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Hecht: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I guess it's more tied to balance sheet stuff in marketplace stuff. I mean the -- your interest income as a percentage of total revenues has moved up as you've increased your balance sheet. So maybe some commentary on -- should that trend persist or should we see a leveling out of the contribution of interest income. What kind of leverage are you guys comfortable with on the balance sheet? And then final tied to that is, how is the marketplace developing? And when do you think you'll start being more active in selling loans to third parties?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. So there's a couple of drivers that are driving the interest income up. One is, as you pointed out, the loans held for investment is higher. The second is the mix of business where we do have some of our largest enterprise partners scaling mostly with interest-bearing programs. And so the product mix has shifted. And then lastly, we've taken on some efforts to raise APRs and all of those taken together has resulted in more interest income. What's important from our perspective is the ability to do that at the point of sale and to do that in a way that doesn't impact conversion really reflects our true technology leadership in a way that I think is pretty difficult for other people to match. With respect to the forward flow program or selling whole loans, it is definitely the case that the volatility in the macroeconomic conditions, definitely changed the mix of business that we were doing with respect to on balance sheet or off balance sheet -- loan funding. That being said, the tone and tenor conversations with Capital Partners today is very constructive. We have a really differentiated credit performance got something that I think loan investors really appreciate about our platform. They know that we are both attending to it, but also can deliver differentiated results, and we're not afraid to eat our own cooking as they say. And I think that gives us some cause for being optimistic about the longer term here. And yet, we\u2019re still in a period of pretty high volatility uncertainty. And so as we think about starting the year off and giving guidance here, we\u2019re being pretty thoughtful about not signing up for more than we know we can deliver.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. Thanks very much. It\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ng: Hey. Good afternoon. I just have two. So the first one is just about the strength of your enterprise partnerships amidst BNPL competition. Are non-exclusive merchants incentive to offer as many BNPL products as possible, including an in-house product. If not, what are some reasons that they choose Affirm. Is it the adapted checkout, the reputation for underwriting and transparency, a desire to have a less clutter checkout. Just any thoughts there would be great. And then I have a quick follow-up.\nMax Levchin: You certainly No. The -- you say parts of the answer really well. In general, I think we've been saying this for a while. There's some slow-moving tendency in the industry towards what we call side by side. That said, we are -- I think, at this point, we can claim the best underwriters in the space and the ones with the best suite of products. There are very few players that can scale long-term zeros, short-term zeros, [indiscernible]. We've experimented with other products that are not even sort of widely available just yet, but we're introducing new financing programs all the time. And we also have a whole what we call power by Affirm, the PBA stack is what our friends at Shopify for example used to do a much deeper integration. So the technical skill set, the scalability, the ability to support every imaginable product in the space typically makes us the dominant player in all these enterprise partnerships. There's definitely interest, I think, from everyone. It's still a very competitive space. There's plenty of people asking themselves, well, maybe we need to have an in-house product. I think in practice, if your business is not very similar to Affirms. It's pretty hard to replicate what we do. We've been at it for nearing 15 years and have done a pretty good job with it. So I think we expect to continue dominating certainly that part of the curve. And enterprises like to partner with serious people that have serious engineering teams that bring strength to those kind of relationships. That's why we won the original sort of big API deal, if you will, Shopify, and we've sort of gone from strength to strength. So I don't expect that to change very much. Undoubtedly, there will be players popping up alongside us. We don't expect that to dramatically change our results.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thanks, Max. And then the second question was just about Affirm card. I was surprised to read that the card volumes are delivering at a similar RLTC as Affirm overall. And I was also surprised that pay now was only 10% of volumes. Was that surprising to you at all? Is there anything that you guys are doing that have resulted in interest-bearing being such an outsized volume on the Affirm card for with such a high frequency kind of top of wallet product.\nMax Levchin: Surprise, no. Food for thought, for sure. So we designed the card with a very specific agenda of creating top of wallet experience or habituation as sort of the pop psychology term. Affirm on average is used basically 4 times a year, and that's great, but that's not nearly enough. You're trying to be a payment network, you have to be there for doughnuts and coffee and for bicycles and couches. And we've more or less conquered the bicycle and couch space, and we're trying to take our unfair share of doughnuts and coffee. And so the pay now volume we expect to grow and we're certainly going to make it compelling to use us for pay now transactions, not necessarily just doughnuts and coffee, but given some items between that and the several hundred dollar average that we normally run, without fall modestly here, it's going according to plan. I'm quite happy with how it's shaping up. We have a lot of work to do. There's certainly room to create consumer rewards that we have not yet launched, but that's a big leap towards why would you pick this card from all the other ones you have in your wallet and that's coming. Once we get there, let's see what part of the pay now and pay later spend will get. One other thoughts are a little bit unrelated. I think it's a little bit dangerous to compare to directly to either debit cards or credit cards when you look at Affirm card, is neither. It really is a new product. There's not quite like anything like this on the market right now. And so in terms of -- am I surprised? No, but mostly because we had expectations that it will be successful because we've seen the demand. And we'll just try to take as much volume as we can.\nMichael Linford: And then just on the margin point, as we outlined in the letter, we're actually not starting from zero with the direct-to-consumer business. We have a virtual card product today. That's one of our most profitable products because it is direct-to-consumer, and we own the whole experience. And that really does give us a lot of advantages. And of the many things that Affirm card does, one of the easiest to understand is it simply takes that experience and turns it into a form factor consumers are super used to and really expands the amount of times you can use the card, use it offline. You can use it in a lot more use cases, whether or not you're integrated with Affirm. And so that part is really unsurprising. We always knew that, that part of the business was going to be really successful. I do think that we want to continue to make it used more. But remember, we are still running at 42% of the transactions being pay now transactions. So we\u2019re getting the frequency that we want out of the card even if the GMV isn\u2019t there because the AOVs are obviously much lower on doughnuts and coffee than they are on bikes and catches.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thanks, Max. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Zane Keller for closing remarks.\nZane Keller: Thank you, everybody, for joining the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thank you, Zane. Thanks, everyone, for joining, and I hope you've had a chance to read our quarterly letter as it includes lots of great information. I mentioned in the letter, we're very proud of the team's accomplishments this quarter, closing out the fiscal year on a high note. In our fiscal Q4, we exceeded our outlook across all key metrics were profitable on an adjusted operating income basis, improved our already great credit metrics while accelerating growth and launched with some amazing brands on the platform. Some of these brands are so cool, we can't even say their names. You just have to go shopping to find them. Dear to my product developing heart, we're finally able to brag about the Affirm Cards progress. We're energized by the momentum we're seeing and are investing significant energy into making the card the top of wallet choice for our consumers. We also expect to deliver annual profitability on an adjusted operating income basis going forward. and our disciplined performance over the last several quarters has earned us the right to return to a more aggressive pace of network growth while maintaining discipline. I tried hard to make my letter a breathy read this quarter, so I hope you have a chance to peruse it, if you haven't yet. For a deeper dive into our numbers, please have a look at the one from Michael. He's a good man and thorough. But in case, you would like even more investor information about Affirm, we're pleased to announce that we will be holding an investor forum on November 14 in New York. At the event, you will hear from several of our management team members, and we will provide an update on our commercial and product initiatives as well as our financial framework. Please look for additional information, including registration details on our Investor Relations website as we get closer to the event. Back to you, Zane. That is accurate. Some sort of a lean and mean code writing machine joke (ph) comes to mind, but I'm not capable of those, but we have been more productive than perhaps ever in our history over the last six months or so? Certainly last three, we\u2019ve really just built a lot of great stuff, and we have no intention of slowing down, looking for efficiencies. You are correct. It's a great question. Thank you, as always. So that should be already apparent in some of the writing we did the highest efficiency way for us to grow kind of what constitutes the existing business is growth through and with our platform partners. And that's where we really can invest the way we know how to do our best work, building products, building features, figuring out how to partner holistically across very, very large surface areas, Shopify, Walmart, et cetera., that's where kind of high, high leverage for every line of code, you get some number of billions dollars or something like that. That's the growth vector for the existing business. You saw the sort of near vertical line we're seeing in the sign-ups with the card, but it's coming from a tiny base. And so at some point, it's going to be -- at this point, I can say that with some amount of confidence, a massive business for us, and we have all the confidence and all the investment to back that confidence up. But in the very immediate future, majority of the growth of GMV will certainly come from existing partnerships with platforms. We're still quite actively signing up new merchants. We're still figuring out ways of expanding programs with those merchants but differently, expanding our share of card with them. But that's roughly the order where we concentrate our energy [indiscernible] my time is largely spent figuring out what next five moves. So the card looks like, I think the core business is a fairly well-oiled machine. We've got some extraordinary partners. We've done well for them. They're quite happy with how we're doing together and we'll continue doing lots of great work there, too. So we've included that in our forecast. So we don't expect it to be something that just happened to a different Galaxy. We expect it to be a modest headwind for us or at least we're prepared for that, and it's priced in, if you will, to our numbers. I have to give a little bit of credit where it's due. I read Mizuho, Dan Dolev's colleagues wrote a nice piece describing what they think will happen to BNPL industry I the student loan repayment restarts. And I won\u2019t comment on exact numbers, but I have to say directionally, we\u2019re in agreement with what they found in the research. So I think it\u2019s a good place to look for thoughts on that. But we don\u2019t think it\u2019s nothing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s very significant either. Seasonality. We know our borrower as well. We know when they have improvements to their personal cash flow, and we know when they struggle a little bit, and we are kind to be in front of that. But it's -- credit is always job number one. We're in control of what's happened and what will happen. Three (ph) question. Obviously, we're strongly engaged with CFPB. We consider them to be our regulator because we are financial services company of scale. And I happen to -- and my team as well happens to believe that credit reporting is a really important piece of the puzzle. We want to make sure that consumers benefit, those that pay us back on time anyway, from their timely repayment in their credit reporting. Part of the work we have done and will do with the bureaus and with our competitors and peers in the industry is actually making sure that the way this is reported is reflective of the factual usage of the product of course, but also does not unduly punish or reward consumers through [indiscernible] idiosyncratic sort of outcomes of the scores. But part of why the NPL world does not like to report to the bureaus, the original scoring systems used by the bureaus, their own or their Issac ones don't really correctly account for what these loans look like just to share multitude of them. And so part of the work we\u2019re doing with the industry and the bureaus is to make sure that it works the right way for a young customer. It's there. It's certainly not fully rolled out yet, but it's definitely something that Shopify is very committed to and as a good partner with so are we. So we have lots of work to do there. I've said many times before, in store is the next frontier. I think frequency is the single most important thing we can focus on in terms of building out the network and most people still shop in stores, at least as much as online or more like 4 times more. And so being offline is really important. That was a great opportunity. We're scaling that up with them. Thank you. Certainly, the right estimation, there are plenty of merchants who are focused on driving their top line. I mean, I think this tends to come up in our conversations on and off. But basically, if you're a fully integrated merchant with a healthy gross margin, then the best way in my bias opinion to protect your price and perception of your prices with consumers is to use Affirm zero percent deals or fixed APR deals at this point, support much more than just zero percent. There's lots and lots of different promotional offerings that we've constructed for our various partners. So we see great interest in that with plenty of merchants who are resellers and they're fairly far down the supply chain, they do not have the margin to support zeros, and it's difficult for them. Sometimes, we're able to bring in manufacturers of the original equipment or the original items and they step in and create zero percent deals, and we have a healthy number of those and have a lot of plans to expand that. But generally speaking, you're exactly right. There's plenty of worry by merchants to keep moving the merchandise they need to discount, discounting kills price integrity and we're here to help. That's a great question. So for the moment, I am personally a little bit [indiscernible] in a sense that we are not quite done improving the frequency. So my goal or the company's goal, the team's goal anyway is to make Affirm card the top of wallet pursing (ph) device, which means that whatever your percentage of paying out transactions is, I want them all and whatever you might put in your credit card, I want you to put on the Debit+ flash Affirm card. So for the moment that sits at 42% pay now or something like that, and the rest is both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing. The really cool footnote in the non-paying out part of this is that we are in control of which one you choose. We are the ones presenting a modified version of Adaptive checkout, both before and after the swipe wherever you decide to go in terms of borrowing. And so we have a lot of control over where you're seeing 0s and we're not seeing 0s and depends very much on the merchant contracts and promotional activities we have with them. But in terms of the target pay now versus not, we'll start reporting on those once we get to a certain level of scale, but at the moment, more of each kind is better. We more than anything benefit from the fact that our terms are short and controllable by us and we price and underwrite every transaction individually. I think if we were in the business of issuing lines, we would have to have an internal economic bureau trying to predict what unemployment looks like six quarters from now because the lines we would have granted today would still be getting utilized or repaid then. And instead, we have the benefit of saying we don't like the latest unemployment imprint, and therefore, we're going to change our credit posture. The way we achieve the results that we are bragging about today in credit has nothing to do with our ability to see the future. We never knew what unemployment would be. We never knew it would be better or worse, but that's just not how this business works. We have the controls to react to literally daily outcomes of our credit monitoring and whatever the future brings, we will adjust to that future. So our assumptions are, we will continue diligence being diligent. We\u2019re going to continue meeting. Every Monday morning the entire executive team looks at all the credit results and ask the question, is everything great or do we need to do something. So I don\u2019t have a promise or a progesterification on unemployment, but I can assure you that whatever the number will be, we\u2019ll be ready for it. I don't know if there's a question in that, that was eloquently put and pretty much accurate. You're on the dot on everything you just said. So you're exactly right, the way the product works. And I'll break it down for like a couple of minutes just to be super clear for everybody. So you sign up for the Affirm card, you get one in the mail. You don't have to do very much work at all. If you are Affirm user you are eligible to use Affirm card, and it's basically literally an Affirm card you request a loan and then you swipe the card or you chip it and the next transaction becomes that loan. So simple as that. It is absolutely much better for us and for our users if you connect your bank account because then you can swipe and if you didn't bother asking for a loan, you can still do it ex-post facto. And if you have nothing, it becomes a pay now transaction that settles. And so it's basically this journey from, I like Affirm, I use Affirm, now I can use it in store, nothing new to learn. As soon as you get a card in the mail, it is our job, and this is exactly where I'm spending the most recent conversation I had about what we call the first user experience was sometime between 1 and 2 o\u2019clock morning in last night. So what I spend my time on is making sure that, that conversion from Affirm card for my well understood part of the Affirm experience to, I can connect to my bank account and get access to all these amazing features. Of course, I want to do that. So that is where we're spending lots and lots of cycles right now. It's going really well. I don't want to get into exact numbers, but where we started and where we ended is a massive progress, and we're very, very far from done. The economics improve, our ability to underwrite improves because we get to see your cash flow, our ability to offer you interesting access to things like zero percent loans improves because we understand the economics a little better and just see frequently high engagement. Therefore, we can make more educated bets around lifetime value over consumers. So everything you said is pretty spot. Let's see if there's anything else I can share on this topic. Both the frequency and the amounts and the LTV, like every metric possibly imagined is better once the card becomes fully fledged. We have internal terminology, specifically describing the sort of unconnected and connected state of the card exactly because it's such an important thing. And yes, we can absolutely low incentives, and we have a lot of good results that show that the incentives are not going to be especially expensive at all. So for what it's worth the wait list included everyone that wanted the Affirm card does not -- the current active base does not necessarily include everyone who wants one because we were very, very careful as we rolled it out in terms of credit standards. In general, while I am gushing here over this amazing product that we finally rolled out and doing really well with. On the other side of that equation is a super sort of Spartan view of credit. We cannot afford to screw that up. And so we're not going to, therefore, launching a brand-new product without a very clear understanding of exactly what repayment will look like to everyone who wants it. It's probably not a good idea, and that's certainly not what we did. But the demand for the card was and is, very, very significant. We're not yet pushing it. In fact, there's a healthy internal debate as to the level of insistence we should take with our users. So there's a couple of million users that we consider to be sort of fully in on the affirmed story. They use us online. They use us at the point of sale, they use the virtual card number, which is like at this point, you can say it's kind of diminished Affirm card experience. And so that group, I have pretty high confidence once the card, would love the card, we can push fairly hard to get them all on it. We have not done that yet, just judging by the numbers. And we reserve the right to do just so. That said, there's plenty of other users that don't understand Affirm as well as we want them to, and they're eligible, and some of them are signing up for the card already. And so there's still lots of work to do on first user experience. We know, for example, I think I mentioned it in the last call, but the sort of the learning curve to date looks something like this. If you do one transaction, you are not guaranteed to stay with us forever. Once you do two transactions that you're basically in and after three transactions, you start reading the card as a sort of integral part of your purchasing experience. And so our goal is to both reduce the level of complexity that it takes to get our users through to understand this as well as guide them to that third transaction to just ensure that they fully grasp it. And we'll continue hammering on that. I expect a few more releases to go by before we feel very satisfied. And at that point, we can push the gas paddle and start basically telling people this is the only way to use Affirm at an unintegrated merchants, the only way to use Affirm offline, although those avenues are still open for a reason. Does that make sense? We definitely think this can and will be material one day. I am definitely not telling you or anyone when exactly that will happen. There's still a lot of work to do. We are rolling it out, like at this point, it's available broadly. If you're eligible in your app, you will find an invitation to take out the Affirm card. What I said is that we're not yet saying -- like for example, when you tap on to the card tab in the app, if you've used Affirm virtual card number, you can still do so. Like, we will tell you, hey, by the way, you\u2019re eligible for the Affirm card, maybe you should grab it, but it\u2019s not the same thing of saying, you wanted to get to the Affirm onetime card, sorry, that deprecated you should use Affirm card that we\u2019ll send you in the mail. So those kind of steps haven\u2019t been taken yet. But we are ramping up like you can see it in the numbers, and we have \u2013 there are a number of things we\u2019re going to do, both as far as educating the end borrower to make sure that they understand how the debit card works. And we will definitely take a bunch of aggressive steps to make sure that everybody who is eligible for it understands exactly that they should come get it. Yes. We certainly like that, obviously. We are taking share of mind share of checkout share of wallet. So I feel very good about that. If you look at more mature BNPL markets, obviously, apples and oranges a little bit, but there are plenty of geos where buy now pay latter, broke into north of 10%, some places even north of 20%. In the U.S. online, I think, in aggregate, we're hanging around 5% or 6% last I looked, this is -- don't quote me on that exactly, but it's that order. If you look at full commerce, both online and offline, it's decidedly sub-1%. So in terms of 99% more to go, and it will probably grow lots before it slows down. It's always work. It's all of this is product work. Like, you don't get to deliver a brand new way to pay for things without customer education, without the right level of promotion in the funnel. So it's definitely not a thing that's going to happen overnight. But on the flip side, you're exactly right. I consider this quarter a preview of things to come. Like we really focused on the right way of bringing the product to the masses and it paid off. So again, I think it's -- we have a market-leading product in a very competitive space that's really exciting and a lot of entrants into the space. I think we're very proud of the fact that we've been able to hold pricing in that competitive environment, macro notwithstanding, I think that we do think about the merchants being very different depending upon their margin structure, their promotional intensity and all that factors into how we think about what MDR is make sense. But again, I think MDR is only one small part of the total pricing equation, which is -- takes into account a lot more than just the MDR being paid because it's obviously, to take into account the cost of the program as well. And when you think about all of these together, we think about the profitability of a particular merchant, not just the MDR that they pay. You certainly No. The -- you say parts of the answer really well. In general, I think we've been saying this for a while. There's some slow-moving tendency in the industry towards what we call side by side. That said, we are -- I think, at this point, we can claim the best underwriters in the space and the ones with the best suite of products. There are very few players that can scale long-term zeros, short-term zeros, [indiscernible]. We've experimented with other products that are not even sort of widely available just yet, but we're introducing new financing programs all the time. And we also have a whole what we call power by Affirm, the PBA stack is what our friends at Shopify for example used to do a much deeper integration. So the technical skill set, the scalability, the ability to support every imaginable product in the space typically makes us the dominant player in all these enterprise partnerships. There's definitely interest, I think, from everyone. It's still a very competitive space. There's plenty of people asking themselves, well, maybe we need to have an in-house product. I think in practice, if your business is not very similar to Affirms. It's pretty hard to replicate what we do. We've been at it for nearing 15 years and have done a pretty good job with it. So I think we expect to continue dominating certainly that part of the curve. And enterprises like to partner with serious people that have serious engineering teams that bring strength to those kind of relationships. That's why we won the original sort of big API deal, if you will, Shopify, and we've sort of gone from strength to strength. So I don't expect that to change very much. Undoubtedly, there will be players popping up alongside us. We don't expect that to dramatically change our results. Surprise, no. Food for thought, for sure. So we designed the card with a very specific agenda of creating top of wallet experience or habituation as sort of the pop psychology term. Affirm on average is used basically 4 times a year, and that's great, but that's not nearly enough. You're trying to be a payment network, you have to be there for doughnuts and coffee and for bicycles and couches. And we've more or less conquered the bicycle and couch space, and we're trying to take our unfair share of doughnuts and coffee. And so the pay now volume we expect to grow and we're certainly going to make it compelling to use us for pay now transactions, not necessarily just doughnuts and coffee, but given some items between that and the several hundred dollar average that we normally run, without fall modestly here, it's going according to plan. I'm quite happy with how it's shaping up. We have a lot of work to do. There's certainly room to create consumer rewards that we have not yet launched, but that's a big leap towards why would you pick this card from all the other ones you have in your wallet and that's coming. Once we get there, let's see what part of the pay now and pay later spend will get. One other thoughts are a little bit unrelated. I think it's a little bit dangerous to compare to directly to either debit cards or credit cards when you look at Affirm card, is neither. It really is a new product. There's not quite like anything like this on the market right now. And so in terms of -- am I surprised? No, but mostly because we had expectations that it will be successful because we've seen the demand. And we'll just try to take as much volume as we can."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, I'll grab that one, and Max, feel free to add anything. I think for the full year, we've put out what we think is the floor will exceed $24 billion in GMV. And that really reflects some uncertainty around where the ceiling is driven in part by things like the Affirm card. The Affirm Card is very early. The charts that we have in our letter showed that kind of steep inflection and early trajectory, which is really exciting, but we're not sure where and when we get to anything that approximates us a peak there. With respect to the margin structure in the business, we would expect to see some -- obviously, the full year impact of a higher rate environment. If you remember, the course of last fiscal year is as rates were constantly rising. And we're at or near the higher end of that rate cycle and would expect that to play out with respect to some headwinds in the cost side. And to offset that, of course, we have some of our consumer pricing initiatives, which will begin to bear real fruit. And all of that is kind of in the top line part of the business. And then with respect to operating expenses, we do expect the full year benefit of the restructuring actions that we took earlier this year, enabling us to deliver what we think will be a profitable year on an adjusted operating income basis. The other thing I add just to be really clear, the 42% stat, and we break it out in our shareholder letter, that's on a transaction basis. We would continue to expect the AOVs of pay now to be substantially lower than the interest-bearing transaction, which means on a GMV basis, the mix would be much lower in terms of percentage of pay now. Yes. So in terms of the fourth quarter, we saw a lot of traction in our travel and ticketing business. You saw the consumer out participating in the economy in those sort of events driven, experiential driven spending patterns. And because of our breadth of distribution there, we were real beneficiaries of that this quarter. We also have done a lot of work to continue to optimize the checkout experience so that we can increase both uptake and our ability to capture volume on those channels and others. And we continue to ramp our largest enterprise platform partnerships as well. Those were big growers for us this quarter, and many of them were even accelerating their growth. So being positioned correctly and distributed correctly at the right parts of the economy, I think definitely benefited us a lot as well as work we've done on our side in terms of product. In terms of forward-looking into the year, I think there's clearly a lot of optimism internally for where we're taking the business and the things that we're working on, and we're just mindful of the economic volatility that continues to persist. And so we're starting the year off with a thoughtful approach here and making sure we don't sign up for more than we know we will deliver. I think the deceleration point, I think that we would expect there to be -- as we continue to scale some of our largest platforms slightly lower growth rate as we do achieve something that looks more like a normalized distribution or penetration on those largest platforms. And yet on the other side, we do have a lot of upside in our direct-to-consumer business. And how those two factors play out is something that will keep you in the loop on throughout the course of this fiscal year. Yes. The timing initiatives that we took last year started in the early summer and through the early fall, so summer time to early fall. So we're kind of in the midst of lapping a lot of those actions. I would say by the time we get to our second quarter is when we have a pretty normalized comparison for the biggest changes. But I do think it's important to reiterate what you said there. We changed our credit decisions a lot all the time. So it's not a decision where we make -- get together when we decide to tighten or loosen in a pretty broad steeping way. We're very tactical and surgical with how we go through and optimize where and when we want to take risk. But the specific decisions that we took in response to the consumer stress that we saw, we will have lapped by the time we get through Q2. Yeah. It's exactly right. And we do expect funding costs to be higher, but we also have some continued changes in the mix of the business, both in terms of the largest platforms, we'll continue to take share, which will change the shape of the timing and how we earn it. The balance sheet will also be very different this year to last year. which again will change the shape quite a bit. There's a lot of different factors that caused that go into that, that assessment. But the top line is right. Those things will net out to being largely flat from a revenue standpoint and an RLTC standpoint as a percentage of GMV. Yeah. So you saw the loans on the balance sheet were obviously higher in Q4 versus the prior year and also up sequentially. We talked about an equity capital require ratio being higher as well. And we would expect there or there would be a lot more dollars sitting on the balance sheet this year than last year, which just changes the shape of the earning of the loans. No, it was always the expectation. We talked about sustainable profitability. We were always thoughtful around our second quarter being a time win. The timing of GMV within the quarter as well as the sequential build from Q1 to Q2, always being distortive. And so we're careful to say that, that may be a trough, and we reiterated that in our letter while we do expect full year profitability, we may have a quarter that may fall outside of that. Clearly, you see our Q1 guidance suggests that, that won't be in Q1 and the full year guidance being where it is, suggests, I think we're \u2013 certainly feel pretty good about that overall. But we won't be disappointed if we have a quarter of negative adjusted operating income. Yes. It's a good question. The -- one of the things that is an important piece of backdrop as you have a rising rate environment, you've also had a lot of the retail sector having a lot of pressure on their margin structure. And so one of the challenges we've worked through over the past year is finding ways still serve as many transactions as we can for those retailers without substantial increases in their MDRs. And so for example, we've introduced fixed APRs, which have low fixed APR amounts that are still subsidized by the merchant, but don't look like the same sort of pure zero percent. And so as a result, you don't see by product a substantial increase in that even though we've changed the economic offer that ultimately the merchant consumer to get to see. Additionally, this view is super helpful to understand actually what the merchants are paying for a product. But it is into a complete view as we're able to think about changing down payment or credit approval thresholds, all these things factor into how we think about the total pricing with the merchant. And so you may not see the results of us getting the right value for Affirm that relationship showing up in the seat of the merchant pace. Good question. And the first part of your question is exactly right. I think that we're not giving a precise range because of the uncertainty and macroeconomic backdrop. I think that if you look at the range that we guided to in Q4, which we were ahead of, you can get a pretty good sense of the fact that we are sitting in a period where you're going to see a quarter-to-quarter variability. What is not in doubt in our eyes is continuing to stick within the 3% to 4% long-term framework we've put out there for revenue less transaction costs as a percentage of GMV. And what's nutting out is our ability to pull the right cost and revenue levers to choose that outcome when we talked about full year guidance as being things that were within our control, and we think this is one where we're going to be able to deliver. We're not going to get more specific than similar to last year right now. Yeah, it's exactly right. We're -- we feel like in this rate environment, the results that we delivered in '23 are representative of the results that we would like to deliver. That being said, of course, any given quarter can move around a non-trivial amount, but nonetheless, feel like similar to '23 is a good place to model the business. Yeah. We do intend to share the Affirm card GMV every quarter. We may not share all the same stats that we did this quarter as we get going. We do think it\u2019s important to communicate the total volume there. We\u2019re not going to give super precise numbers with respect to the Affirm card guidance for the year, but what we will say is there\u2019s a couple of points of growth that we think the card will drive. Yeah. So there's a couple of drivers that are driving the interest income up. One is, as you pointed out, the loans held for investment is higher. The second is the mix of business where we do have some of our largest enterprise partners scaling mostly with interest-bearing programs. And so the product mix has shifted. And then lastly, we've taken on some efforts to raise APRs and all of those taken together has resulted in more interest income. What's important from our perspective is the ability to do that at the point of sale and to do that in a way that doesn't impact conversion really reflects our true technology leadership in a way that I think is pretty difficult for other people to match. With respect to the forward flow program or selling whole loans, it is definitely the case that the volatility in the macroeconomic conditions, definitely changed the mix of business that we were doing with respect to on balance sheet or off balance sheet -- loan funding. That being said, the tone and tenor conversations with Capital Partners today is very constructive. We have a really differentiated credit performance got something that I think loan investors really appreciate about our platform. They know that we are both attending to it, but also can deliver differentiated results, and we're not afraid to eat our own cooking as they say. And I think that gives us some cause for being optimistic about the longer term here. And yet, we\u2019re still in a period of pretty high volatility uncertainty. And so as we think about starting the year off and giving guidance here, we\u2019re being pretty thoughtful about not signing up for more than we know we can deliver. And then just on the margin point, as we outlined in the letter, we're actually not starting from zero with the direct-to-consumer business. We have a virtual card product today. That's one of our most profitable products because it is direct-to-consumer, and we own the whole experience. And that really does give us a lot of advantages. And of the many things that Affirm card does, one of the easiest to understand is it simply takes that experience and turns it into a form factor consumers are super used to and really expands the amount of times you can use the card, use it offline. You can use it in a lot more use cases, whether or not you're integrated with Affirm. And so that part is really unsurprising. We always knew that, that part of the business was going to be really successful. I do think that we want to continue to make it used more. But remember, we are still running at 42% of the transactions being pay now transactions. So we\u2019re getting the frequency that we want out of the card even if the GMV isn\u2019t there because the AOVs are obviously much lower on doughnuts and coffee than they are on bikes and catches."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nZane Keller: Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them, except as required by law.

Hosting today's call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer. In line with our practice with prior quarters, we will begin with brief opening remarks from Max before proceeding immediately into questions and answers. On that note, I will turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. Thanks everyone for joining, and I hope you had a chance to read our quarterly letter as it packs lots of great information, but I will offer a very quick summary for you. We had an excellent quarter, beat across all of the important metrics we track, while continuing to maintain excellent credit results. On the execution side of things, I'm really proud of how the team performed this quarter. We shipped well over 100 projects from pricing to new credit model to dozens of user interface improvements. In isolation, each of these wins is probably relatively small, but they compounded to huge gains. One major project this quarter was our continued effort in rolling out Debit+. We delivered Debit+ into the main Affirm app, and while it's still quite early, we continue seeing strong signal to consumer demand. Debit+ user transaction frequency after 90 days from activation is about 7x that of a regular Affirm user. I'm truly excited about this product and what the team has planned for it and we intend to give you a significantly more fulsome update on Debit+ in the quarters to come. Seems that there is a once in a century event that happens every week lately, rattling capital markets, but we continue to deliver great returns for our capital market partners and it was rewarded by an incremental addition to our funding capacity in the quarter, as well as in April after we closed. So, in short, we had a great quarter, we compounded many small wins into big gains. We're very excited about Debit+ and the overall outlook for Affirm as a company.  Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller: Great. Thank you, Max. With that, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks and congratulations. I saw in your letter, Michael, that you had 110 basis point increase in the interest bearing GMV in the quarter and more than that if you went back 6 months. Could you talk a little bit about how much that will have risen by the time this is fully phased in? And also, just strategically, how does that impact your \u2013 both your willingness to serve certain types of merchants and your credit decisioning and what impact that could have on GMV?\nMichael Linford: Thanks. Yes. We are proud of the progress that we made in our pricing initiatives. Just to recap on how this works, the first step for us is getting any caps in the way \u2013 getting those caps out of the way, allowing us to price where we think we need to price always underneath 36. We were subject to a number of 30% APR caps. And so, one potential way to read that is there are 6 points. However, we don't intend to price every one with that amount so there is a reasonable limit to expect. That being said, we're about halfway rolled out and we've got about a point. So, I think a fair rule of thumb would be to double our progress today and that's a good ending spot. In terms of the impact that those pricing initiatives have on approvals is absolutely the case that we get to approve more consumers, drive better conversion for our merchant partners, and grow our business faster by being able to price loans in that zone. And that is our intent. Our intent would be to leverage that to protect asset yields for our investors and still approve more volume. And part of the reason why we've seen the acceleration in our direct-to-consumer business is because of how we've been operating it, frankly, since we've been able to get that moved first ahead of any, sort of merchant interaction.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. \nBryan Keane: Hi guys. Mike, maybe you could just give us your thoughts on the guidance in particular revenue less transaction, March, just looking at that? And then the net take rate, I know there's always some puts and takes there when I look sequentially will actually just gross take rate and then net take rate. Maybe you can just help us walk us through between 3Q to 4Q. \nMichael Linford : Yes, thanks. We had obviously a really strong quarter on revenue less transaction costs in Q3 driven in large part by our outperformance in credit. That resulted in a pretty large be ahead of our expectations in the provision for losses. And that was despite operating in a very volatile capital markets. We assume that Q4 will remain volatile. That's not to say that isn't a spot where we can add capacity. We do intend to add capacity like we do almost every quarter, but it does mean that we're being very thoughtful around what we assume as we prepare a forecast in the guidance that we don't aren't overly reliant on things getting better in the debt capital markets for us. What that means for us is a little bit more of a reliance or usage of our warehouse funding mechanisms into our fourth quarter. And as you see in the GMV guidance, we're showing pretty strong sequential GMV growth from Q3 to Q4. In fact, from a seasonality perspective, I think even faster than what we saw last year, and as we saw during our second quarter, when you have that, kind of sequential growth in GMV or that acceleration quarter-to-quarter, it can sometimes push some of the economics for loans originating in the quarter and the subsequent quarters. And the reason why Q3's outperformance was so strong was in part because of the \u2013 both the volume and balance sheet strategies we had used in Q2. So, follow the markets that we think we're going to be able to continue to navigate to fund and scale the business, but will change the shape of the earning a little bit and what we saw in Q3 versus Q2, we kind of expect to see in Q1 of next year against Q4 this year.\nBryan Keane: Got it. No, that's really helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, the initial rollout of Debit+, how do we think about the modeling for that and the impact probably obviously not much in 4Q. But when should we start to see an impact and how do we think about the modeling? \nMichael Linford: Yes, we haven't broken anything out because it's not big yet. We do intend to give you better tools to model it when we have it becoming a more material part of our business. And because we're not providing any guidance in 2024, we're not doing that today. But as we talked about before, there's really two different pieces to that product. One is, it will look more like our direct-to-consumer product that we have today just looks like an installment loan. Whether that's a paying for or a monthly installment loan, the other would be a P&L volume, which of course will have a very different margin structure. And later this calendar year we plan on walking everyone through how to think about modeling it and the impact it has on the P&L.\nBryan Keane: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRamsey El-Assal: Yes. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could update us on credit reporting and buy now, pay later seems to be an area of growing interest. Just wondering if you could share your latest thoughts on that topic?\nMax Levchin: So, first of all, I encourage everybody to look at the report, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published just about a year ago actually, just under a year ago. Where they highlighted what they like and dislike or cap concerns rather about in buy now, pay later, the headline was really, hey, this is a really good product better than credit cards. That said, their concerns specifically around stacking and furnishing, which is a fancy term for reporting credit performance back to the credit reporting agencies. And CPB expressed strong desire to see the industry figure out a way to help folks build the credits and also have accurate reporting of performance of these loans. Actually, quite proud to share that we at Affirm are partnering with FICO, which is the maker of preeminent scores out there to build a first of its kind credit scoring model that would enable buy now, pay later loans to be consistently transparently factored into credit and lending decisions. And to be reported to the credit reporting agencies. I'm a big fan of Will Lansing who runs FICO. And I really appreciate his partnership on and so we're quite excited to talk more about it when we're ready, but we intend to step into the leadership role and help the industry report buy now, pay loans and make sense of them in the broader context of borrowing.\nRamsey El-Assal : Thank you. That's super helpful. A quick follow-up from me. There's been some media chatter about some potential consolidation in the, sort of broader buy now, pay later space. What is your sort of house view on exploring strategic alternatives for the business? Is it something that you'd be open to at this point or maybe not at this juncture in the cycle?\nMax Levchin: I'm very focused on things that I love doing versus speculating on such complicated things as strategic matters. We're very, very much heads down on just building out the product in particular Debit+, which is as everybody knows is my baby. I think that's where my mind is at.\nRamsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys.\nMichael Linford: Lost Jason. Operator, I think we need another.\nOperator: Jason, you're back in.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Can you hear me?\nMichael Linford: We lost you. Please repeat that.\nOperator: I think we can hear you now. Try asking again.\nJason Kupferberg: Can you guys hear me?\nOperator: Yes.\nJason Kupferberg: Oh, sorry about that. I wanted to ask about the reserve ratio. It's declined for I think six straight quarters and can you talk about some of the drivers of that trend, could it move lower from here? And then maybe just remind us what drives the seasonally higher delinquencies in Q4 that you touched on in the shareholder letter? Thanks.\nMichael Linford: Yes. Really proud of the credit results in the business and given the very short duration of our asset, the real time performance of the portfolio drives the allowance calculation for Affirm. So, what we're not doing is, making estimates of where the economy will be in a year and building balances for that. Because by the time we get there, of course our asset turns over too fast, there'll be very little of any principal left on the balance sheet or outstanding with even forward flow partners by the time you get there. And so, we don't think about credit as a long-term estimate, instead, we think about it as a more near-term reflection of the actual performance of the credit that we have out. And given our really strong delinquency performance, measured however you'd like, the allowance rate has continued to come down and we would expect that to be in-line with historical patterns from here. The seasonal factors that come into play are a little bit, it's a little bit inverted. The biggest seasonal factor is the depressed delinquency numbers you see in and around tax return season. And so, as you get past that, you start to normalize up a little bit. We would expect to follow the seasonal trends, pretty much directly on our regular credit monitoring shows being right on top of the historical patterns here and feel very confident about staying within those [bands] [ph].\nJason Kupferberg: That's helpful. And I'm curious if you can share with us GMV growth if we exclude not only Peloton, but Amazon. I mean, if not a specific number just directionally what it looked like perhaps versus last quarter?\nMichael Linford: We're not going to provide any numbers broken out. But what I can say is that we had exceptionally strong growth in a couple of pockets. Our largest partners grew really quickly, including our partnerships with platforms like Shopify where we actually saw an acceleration in the business. We also had a real acceleration in our direct-to-consumer business, which is obviously away from merchants like Amazon. And yet, we showed really strong growth with Amazon as well.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Thanks for the color, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Appreciate taking the question. Looks like some good momentum in Debit+ Max, which is encouraging. And I think you called out in the letter 5% [the card] [ph] present spend today. Where do you think that number can go, and is grocery still the primary category? Because it seems to me if you have a lot of success in card present, the whole nature of the business model changes. I know you're not talking about the economics of card present transactions yet. But how should we think about, is this going to be a steep ramp longer-term trend changed? How are you thinking about that?\nMax Levchin: So, just to quibble a little bit maybe with the grocery points, I never said grocery is the primary used case. It just happens to be the thing that most of us buy a lot. So, I think that's necessarily a common purchase if it's a top of wallet card. The goal for Debit+ is to become the top of wallet. If you ask any Affirmer what is the most common word out of my mouth in the last 3 months, everyone will probably tell you frequency. Like what we want is, consumer frequency. 88% of our transactions are coming from repeat consumers, that's not an accident. We will continue putting lots and lots of wood behind that particular era. The ramp of Debit+, I think it's something that's probably premature to talk about too much right now. I'm incredibly happy where the product is, which was not the case 6 or 9 months ago. I'm really glad we took the time to build it the right way. I think we need to do it right to roll it out correctly, make sure that we continue delivering on the overall company goals while ramping up Debit+. I think it\u2019s probably a little too early to declare the shape of the curve of the Debit+ adoption. That said, I'm finally now putting in front of every one of our users that qualify for it and quite excited about that.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. Helpful. And then Michael, we're watching equity capital required as a percent of the platform funding, sort of creep up here can you comment on that. I assume we're not going back to 10% maybe clarify that and also just discuss, sort of how you think about life of loan profitability given some of the shifts in funding?\nMichael Linford : Yes. So with respect to equity capital, it is creeping up and above our long-term goal of 5% and nowhere near 10%. We don't intend to run the business anywhere near that number. I think we said that last quarter, I'll just keep repeating it and thank you for the question because it's \u2013 I know it's on people's minds. We don't want to run a business with that much equity capital. Today, we have a pretty low leverage, let's say a low advanced rate funding strategy with our warehouse lines, for example, And that's a lever that we could pull in the future if we continue to feel like we're operating in this environment and need to use balance sheet, but today it hasn't been a priority for us because, firstly, we have adequate liquidity with over $2 billion of cash and securities available for sale and obviously our economics on loans that we put on the balance sheet actually do return higher to us overall. And so those two factors were not really too worked up around it today, something that the team will get work on in the future if the current market continues to operate like this. In terms of the total loan economics in this funding environment, we feel really good about it. You saw this quarter's revenue less transaction costs being a little over the midpoint of the 3% to 4% range that we've talked about. We're going to oscillate quarter-to-quarter with an \u2013 or and admittedly high degree of volatility, but none of that takes away from our confidence in that 3% to 4% range. If you think about the question that was asked at the very top of the call, our ability to get those pricing initiatives over the line and realize will offset a healthy amount of the headwind that we're experiencing in the capital markets broadly.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Alright, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.\nEugene Simuni: Hi, guys. Thank you. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a relatively high level question. Great to see strong credit performance over the last couple of quarters. I think it kind of gives evidence to what you guys have been always saying your ability to really control credit outcomes. So, that's great to see. So that's sort of a word that you pool. I think the natural question becomes, is there an opportunity to tune the needle to make the credit performance a little bit worse, but volume growth, which perhaps is something that would be desirable. So, with the loss if you can give us your latest, kind of philosophy on that, what opportunity do you see there, especially as we exit the volatile times hopefully that we are \u2013 that we're in today and maybe gives you a little bit more opportunity to turn that dial? I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.\nMax Levchin: Great question. First of all, I hope the world is listening because I [indiscernible] saying the same thing for a very long time printing quarter-after-quarter of good credit returns. And at some point, I think people will believe us, but until we do and well after it, credit is always job number 1, probably through number 5. I think as a non-depository lender, it is our responsibility to deliver good returns to our capital partners to make sure that they never have a second thought about partnering with us. That's philosophically at the very, very top of what matters to us. We have a mission, that mission has everything to do with, delivering honest financial products to improve people's lives, but the only way we can achieve that mission is by having strong capital market partnerships. And the way we get that is through having consistent and really strong credit performance. So, that's ultra-important, no compromise there. The question around, is there pockets of growth, if I can put words in your mouth, with credit as a sort of chip to cash in. The short-answer is, I think we'll know a lot more in the coming few quarters. On the positive side of things, the economy is basically fully employed. The inflation, knock on wood, tomorrow's news or whenever the next CPI print is, is not negative, but it does feel like the Fed is actually succeeding if maybe not, as quick as they would like, in doing their job and tamping inflation down. Meanwhile, the labor market held up. And if that continues, that may be \u2013 does look like soft landing, and that would be quite excellent for all involved. There are lots of things that could go wrong. For example, the student loan repayment that's going to hit us sometime July, August time frame impact a lot of consumers. And we want to make sure that we are prepared for either side of that equation. The good news is that the reason we have such control over our credit outcomes is because we are structurally just really, really short duration. So, as we see the next change in the weather vein, we know how to tune credit approvals to make sure that we stay within the bands that we must stay. The slightly unrelated, but \u2013 or related to a slightly different answer to your question though, I said it last quarter a little bit and sort of tried to highlight it in the letter this time around, we have an enormous amount of opportunity in growth that has nothing to do with credit. A lot of the acceleration you see in consumer, some of the really successful performance we've seen with our partners, Michael mentioned that our business with Shopify accelerated this quarter, a lot of that has nothing to do with credit. In fact, it has everything to do with optimizing every little bit we can, like you would be either bored to tears or excited by the pipeline of projects that we've put forth on just every possible metric of the business that has nothing to do with credit performance. And I'll \u2013 I promise I'll keep this short as I can, but just a very, very quick walk-through of what it means to actually apply and get approved for a loan with Affirm. So, you find this typically up funnel. There's a, I think we call as low as, which is basically an opportunity to prequalify. That's about three screens, then you get to check-out that's a apply for a loan, you get your selection of terms. You select one, then you go to \u2013 if it's a new sign-up identification, if not behind the [indiscernible] then you see a treat and lending disclosure. Then you have to agree, then you sign up for auto pay or type in your payment credentials.  Every one of the \u2013 it's a huge amount of steps. It's actually a product that needs to be simplified more, and we're working tirelessly on it. That's also why I'm so excited about this card because a lot of these steps are completely disappeared with the card product. But online, each one of these steps has a conversion rate. And I am not kidding what I can tell you, I can rattle off every one of these steps, conversion rate, what it was and what it will be when we're done with the work. And it's something that keeps me excited and up at night because there's so much opportunity to just get more people through the funnel. And so, we'll continue investing in that relentlessly. Credit is not for playing games with.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Got it. Very helpful. And then for a quick follow-up. Very interesting to see direct-to-consumer highlighted, kind of at the top of the letter this time. It sounds like great progress in Debit+. Can you talk a little bit about direct-to-consumers strategically? And the way you laid it out in the shareholder letter, it sounded to me like the sequence of consumer engagement is still going to be merchant \u2013 through merchant first and sort of direct-to-consumer then second. Am I interpreting that correctly? Or are you also going to be focusing on finding merchants who just engage directly through direct-to-consumer?\nMax Levchin: You're 100% rates. It is exactly \u2013 so what I attempted to do in the shareholder letter is to lay out the flywheel. One of the greatest things about Affirm, since the very beginning of time, is we have no cost of user acquisition. Merchants promote our product to their shoppers that they hope to turn into buyers because we're able to approve the right number of shoppers and help them buy. As these consumers come back to us, we have a chance to introduce them to new products. Card is the single most important one. That is the thing that we're working so and we're now seeing real fruit of our labor. With an Affirm card, Debit+, in their physical wallet, in their electronic wallets, in their browser, autofill, everywhere can possibly put it, the consumers come back to other merchants, whether they are integrated or not. One of the really, really important things that I think I ultimately edited out because the letter was getting longer than I wanted to, but it's really worth highlighting, the card will work, all the Affirm functionality will work at any merchant even if that has absolutely nothing to do with the Affirm integration. So, pick a favorite brand where Affirm is not yet offered. All you need to do is sign up for the card, which is now basically available to anyone, bring your card to that site or to that store, and you suddenly have both pay now and buy now, pay later functionality on a single payment device. But the flywheel is merchant integration, consumer transactions, consumer repayment gives us a chance to market Debit+ to these consumers, Debit+ becomes the universal access to Affirm at any point of sale.\nEugene Simuni : Got it. Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS. Please proceed.\nKaran Singhania: Hi. This is Karan Singhania, dialing in for Rayna. Thanks for taking my question. So, can you just tell us a little bit about what's going on with the capital markets? Any updates there? And any change in invest in the line for secular based consumer credit assets?\nMichael Linford: Yes. So, the good news about the capital markets is that we demonstrated in our 23A deal and the recent reopening that when structured correctly and timed correctly, we're able to access the ABS market, I think, really constructively. The \u2013 qualitatively, the investor sentiment was exceptionally positive in our 23A reopening. Our team did a really good job in working with investors and executing in that market. Quantitatively, that particular transaction was 3x oversubscribed. And those are all really positive signals, but it's important to put that transaction in context of the broader capital markets and macroeconomic conditions. We did that transaction in between the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and the sale of First Republic. And I think that it is the case that these things do not impact us directly on a first order basis, but credit spreads for all asset classes, including ours, are going to widen in times of these moments of pretty peak economic dislocation. It is just an unfortunate reality of the world right now that things are extremely volatile. That being said, we did execute those two transactions I mentioned in between these pretty severe economic events. And we are confident that we can continue to do so, but nonetheless, it will remain volatile. We're also adding net new partners in our funding ecosystem, adding warehouse funding capacity from net new institutions and expanding existing relationships with our existing funding partners. And I would just leave you with the idea that it's volatile. And obviously, spreads are widening, and that will offset some of what we expect to be a declining rate environment going forward. But nonetheless, still able to fund the business, which is always job one for our capital team, and we've done that excellently.\nKaran Singhania: Understood. And maybe just as a follow-up. Can you comment on what's driving the uplift in the Debit+ usage? Is it just something that consumers are resonating with the products value proposition or is there something else?\nMax Levchin: We've built out really great products that we've put in front of at this point, lots of consumers who \u2013 many of whom have told us over and over again that they would love to use Affirm at their favorite grocery, at their favorite off-line store, at a website where a competitor might be integrated, but they prefer Affirm. Debit+ is the unlock to use Affirm anywhere you like online and offline. It's gaining popularity, and we're very excited. And by the way, just to be very clear, this is very much V1. The road map for Debit+ spans years. We have a lot to build. So, this is not even remotely the final movement of that particular thing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Excellent quarter. I love the acceleration in revenue less transaction costs. Great job there. A quick question guys and Max, like you're \u2013 I think you're guiding to a slightly lower revenue less transaction cost in the fourth quarter and long-term, you're still saying 3% to 4%. Can you maybe bridge us just kind of that \u2013 how to get to that long term? How do you \u2013 what do you envision to get to that sustained long-term? Thank you.\nMichael Linford: Yes. We still feel very confident about 3% to 4%. In the long run, this quarter was again, the higher-end of that range and also ahead of our expectations that we had provided guidance for in February. And yet, we do forecast a sequential reduction in that as a percentage of GMV into next quarter. But again, I think the two factors to think about are when we have a sequential growth in GMV and we use our warehouse funding, that means that we provide the provision for the loans that originated upfront. And we are a little bit back in how those earn. And that is very similar to what you saw in Q3. We were benefiting in Q3 from the origination and balance sheet strategy in Q2. And we'd anticipate a similar trend to play out for Q4 versus Q3. And then separately, it is just the case that we have a very volatile capital market. So, our guidance is always going to try to assume what we think we have a high degree of confidence in. And we have a lot of sensitivity to our ability to execute there. And so, when we think about building guidance and our forecast, we're pretty careful about making sure we have, in the model, the deals that we expect to be able to complete in the quarter.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Thank you. Great results. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJames Faucette: Hi, everybody. Thanks a lot for all the color and questions today. Given your APR cap increases that I think you said across half of roughly your merchants, two things associated that with that. When do you expect that to be complete? And how much incremental application demand is that allowing you to convert? Any metrics you could share there?\nMichael Linford: Yes. On the first, I don't think that we're ever going to get to 100%. So, complete is probably like never. I mean, we're going to keep moving forward and try to continue to expand it, but we don't expect to ever be at 100% of our merchants for a variety of reasons we can go into. But we do anticipate continuing to make progress with respect to merchant amendments to allow us to go up to 36%. So, we've a lot of wood left to chop, and we're going to keep working on that between now and the rest of this calendar year. When you think about what that does for approvals, it's a pretty simple answer with really complicated math. The simple answer is, we try to maintain the same level of unit profitability. And so, the extra revenue allows us to approve proportionately more and offsetting the associated credit losses you'd expect in those marginal populations. And we do think about it on a portfolio basis. And so, it is obviously something that allows us to create a lot more economic yield across the portfolio and approve more consumers as a result. It is also the case that we need some of that to offset the rising cost of funding and maintain the unit economics that we need. So, not all of it will go to expanded approvals. And certainly, there are a set of approvals that we simply can't and don't want to approve, right? We don't \u2013 a consumer defaulting on a loan is a bad outcome that we seek to avoid. And so, we're never going to recklessly improve a consumer who we think will. That being said, it is the current posture of the business given the credit tightening that we've done do allow us to be expansionary with any 36% cap.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it. And then \u2013 I appreciate that. And then just quickly on trends. I know that you kind of mentioned that you'd seen strong services in travel, although a little bit of weaker performance in discretionary. Has that changed at all or worsened maybe for discretionary through April and the first few days of May?\nMax Levchin : I think the short answer is, no, we're not seeing particularly significant movement in either direction. Travel remains very strong.\nMichael Linford: Yes. And other color on the quarter. We mentioned our strength in direct-to-consumer, our guidance definitely points to that trend continuing where we also have strength in some of our largest partnerships that are either accelerating or still growing at very, very fast clips. And travel and ticketing remains a real bright spot. We continue to see weakness in sporting goods overall. Although as we get through the next quarter, we do have what used to be our largest partner, will now be less than 1% of our GMV going forward and becomes very trivial. And so some of the sporting goods headwind will become a lot less of an impact in the GMV growth rate of the business. And then obviously, categories like home and lifestyle and electronics continue to be in a pretty suppressed levels when thinking about their comparisons. We do think that as you get to Q3 of next fiscal year, when we get to about 9 months from now, you will begin to lap a lot easier comps. And so, we're optimistic that by the time we get there, some of those businesses will return to some solid growth. But for now, the headwinds there continue.\nJames Faucette : Great. Thanks for that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.\nRob Wildhack: Hi, guys. With Debit+ out in the wild now, can you give us some additional color on the unit economics there? And how they fit into the 3% to 4% RLTC as a percentage of GMV that you have in the core business?\nMichael Linford: We do plan on giving a very detailed breakdown for investors later this year, not today. But again, think about the products, GMV, the stuff that looks like installment loans will sit within our framework today because they are very similar loans, and they should have similar economics, some more funding requirements, similar \u2013 it's more of what we do every day. The volume that we call pay now that comes out of the consumers' accounts a few days after they swipe the card, those will have different economics. Today, that's not the majority of the volume running on the card. But we'll watch that closely and give investors a way to think about modeling that as it becomes material.\nRob Wildhack: Okay. And then I noticed that you reaffirmed the commitment to positive adjusted operating income exiting this year. If you think about or look to that over the medium-term, what's the current line of thinking on the level of reinvestment you need to continue to scale versus your ability to generate real operating leverage and start to drop some of that more and more to earnings?\nMichael Linford: It's a good question. So, as you saw in this quarter and our guidance kind of implies, we expect to continue to drive real leverage in G&A. Sales and marketing on a non-GAAP adjusted basis will continue to be slightly volatile in that some of our co-marketing commitments are a little bit more episodic.  So, you'll see that number kind of bounce around a little bit. But over time, still showing re-levered. But the area of the business that we do intend to continue to invest in is tech data analytics that enables growth in the business both in the near term, enabling us to add infrastructure and acquire more data, but also hire engineers and product managers to build product to change the world. And so, we are going to keep doing that, and we intend to keep our foot on the gas with the technology side of the business and showing leverage in the other parts. We've not given a framework for what that means in terms of bottom line profitability growth or the trend of adjusted operating income, but we do intend to update investors on that later this year.\nRob Wildhack: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Zane Keller.\nZane Keller: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thank you, Zane. Thanks everyone for joining, and I hope you had a chance to read our quarterly letter as it packs lots of great information, but I will offer a very quick summary for you. We had an excellent quarter, beat across all of the important metrics we track, while continuing to maintain excellent credit results. On the execution side of things, I'm really proud of how the team performed this quarter. We shipped well over 100 projects from pricing to new credit model to dozens of user interface improvements. In isolation, each of these wins is probably relatively small, but they compounded to huge gains. One major project this quarter was our continued effort in rolling out Debit+. We delivered Debit+ into the main Affirm app, and while it's still quite early, we continue seeing strong signal to consumer demand. Debit+ user transaction frequency after 90 days from activation is about 7x that of a regular Affirm user. I'm truly excited about this product and what the team has planned for it and we intend to give you a significantly more fulsome update on Debit+ in the quarters to come. Seems that there is a once in a century event that happens every week lately, rattling capital markets, but we continue to deliver great returns for our capital market partners and it was rewarded by an incremental addition to our funding capacity in the quarter, as well as in April after we closed. So, in short, we had a great quarter, we compounded many small wins into big gains. We're very excited about Debit+ and the overall outlook for Affirm as a company.  Back to you, Zane. So, first of all, I encourage everybody to look at the report, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published just about a year ago actually, just under a year ago. Where they highlighted what they like and dislike or cap concerns rather about in buy now, pay later, the headline was really, hey, this is a really good product better than credit cards. That said, their concerns specifically around stacking and furnishing, which is a fancy term for reporting credit performance back to the credit reporting agencies. And CPB expressed strong desire to see the industry figure out a way to help folks build the credits and also have accurate reporting of performance of these loans. Actually, quite proud to share that we at Affirm are partnering with FICO, which is the maker of preeminent scores out there to build a first of its kind credit scoring model that would enable buy now, pay later loans to be consistently transparently factored into credit and lending decisions. And to be reported to the credit reporting agencies. I'm a big fan of Will Lansing who runs FICO. And I really appreciate his partnership on and so we're quite excited to talk more about it when we're ready, but we intend to step into the leadership role and help the industry report buy now, pay loans and make sense of them in the broader context of borrowing. I'm very focused on things that I love doing versus speculating on such complicated things as strategic matters. We're very, very much heads down on just building out the product in particular Debit+, which is as everybody knows is my baby. I think that's where my mind is at. So, just to quibble a little bit maybe with the grocery points, I never said grocery is the primary used case. It just happens to be the thing that most of us buy a lot. So, I think that's necessarily a common purchase if it's a top of wallet card. The goal for Debit+ is to become the top of wallet. If you ask any Affirmer what is the most common word out of my mouth in the last 3 months, everyone will probably tell you frequency. Like what we want is, consumer frequency. 88% of our transactions are coming from repeat consumers, that's not an accident. We will continue putting lots and lots of wood behind that particular era. The ramp of Debit+, I think it's something that's probably premature to talk about too much right now. I'm incredibly happy where the product is, which was not the case 6 or 9 months ago. I'm really glad we took the time to build it the right way. I think we need to do it right to roll it out correctly, make sure that we continue delivering on the overall company goals while ramping up Debit+. I think it\u2019s probably a little too early to declare the shape of the curve of the Debit+ adoption. That said, I'm finally now putting in front of every one of our users that qualify for it and quite excited about that. Great question. First of all, I hope the world is listening because I [indiscernible] saying the same thing for a very long time printing quarter-after-quarter of good credit returns. And at some point, I think people will believe us, but until we do and well after it, credit is always job number 1, probably through number 5. I think as a non-depository lender, it is our responsibility to deliver good returns to our capital partners to make sure that they never have a second thought about partnering with us. That's philosophically at the very, very top of what matters to us. We have a mission, that mission has everything to do with, delivering honest financial products to improve people's lives, but the only way we can achieve that mission is by having strong capital market partnerships. And the way we get that is through having consistent and really strong credit performance. So, that's ultra-important, no compromise there. The question around, is there pockets of growth, if I can put words in your mouth, with credit as a sort of chip to cash in. The short-answer is, I think we'll know a lot more in the coming few quarters. On the positive side of things, the economy is basically fully employed. The inflation, knock on wood, tomorrow's news or whenever the next CPI print is, is not negative, but it does feel like the Fed is actually succeeding if maybe not, as quick as they would like, in doing their job and tamping inflation down. Meanwhile, the labor market held up. And if that continues, that may be \u2013 does look like soft landing, and that would be quite excellent for all involved. There are lots of things that could go wrong. For example, the student loan repayment that's going to hit us sometime July, August time frame impact a lot of consumers. And we want to make sure that we are prepared for either side of that equation. The good news is that the reason we have such control over our credit outcomes is because we are structurally just really, really short duration. So, as we see the next change in the weather vein, we know how to tune credit approvals to make sure that we stay within the bands that we must stay. The slightly unrelated, but \u2013 or related to a slightly different answer to your question though, I said it last quarter a little bit and sort of tried to highlight it in the letter this time around, we have an enormous amount of opportunity in growth that has nothing to do with credit. A lot of the acceleration you see in consumer, some of the really successful performance we've seen with our partners, Michael mentioned that our business with Shopify accelerated this quarter, a lot of that has nothing to do with credit. In fact, it has everything to do with optimizing every little bit we can, like you would be either bored to tears or excited by the pipeline of projects that we've put forth on just every possible metric of the business that has nothing to do with credit performance. And I'll \u2013 I promise I'll keep this short as I can, but just a very, very quick walk-through of what it means to actually apply and get approved for a loan with Affirm. So, you find this typically up funnel. There's a, I think we call as low as, which is basically an opportunity to prequalify. That's about three screens, then you get to check-out that's a apply for a loan, you get your selection of terms. You select one, then you go to \u2013 if it's a new sign-up identification, if not behind the [indiscernible] then you see a treat and lending disclosure. Then you have to agree, then you sign up for auto pay or type in your payment credentials.  Every one of the \u2013 it's a huge amount of steps. It's actually a product that needs to be simplified more, and we're working tirelessly on it. That's also why I'm so excited about this card because a lot of these steps are completely disappeared with the card product. But online, each one of these steps has a conversion rate. And I am not kidding what I can tell you, I can rattle off every one of these steps, conversion rate, what it was and what it will be when we're done with the work. And it's something that keeps me excited and up at night because there's so much opportunity to just get more people through the funnel. And so, we'll continue investing in that relentlessly. Credit is not for playing games with. You're 100% rates. It is exactly \u2013 so what I attempted to do in the shareholder letter is to lay out the flywheel. One of the greatest things about Affirm, since the very beginning of time, is we have no cost of user acquisition. Merchants promote our product to their shoppers that they hope to turn into buyers because we're able to approve the right number of shoppers and help them buy. As these consumers come back to us, we have a chance to introduce them to new products. Card is the single most important one. That is the thing that we're working so and we're now seeing real fruit of our labor. With an Affirm card, Debit+, in their physical wallet, in their electronic wallets, in their browser, autofill, everywhere can possibly put it, the consumers come back to other merchants, whether they are integrated or not. One of the really, really important things that I think I ultimately edited out because the letter was getting longer than I wanted to, but it's really worth highlighting, the card will work, all the Affirm functionality will work at any merchant even if that has absolutely nothing to do with the Affirm integration. So, pick a favorite brand where Affirm is not yet offered. All you need to do is sign up for the card, which is now basically available to anyone, bring your card to that site or to that store, and you suddenly have both pay now and buy now, pay later functionality on a single payment device. But the flywheel is merchant integration, consumer transactions, consumer repayment gives us a chance to market Debit+ to these consumers, Debit+ becomes the universal access to Affirm at any point of sale. We've built out really great products that we've put in front of at this point, lots of consumers who \u2013 many of whom have told us over and over again that they would love to use Affirm at their favorite grocery, at their favorite off-line store, at a website where a competitor might be integrated, but they prefer Affirm. Debit+ is the unlock to use Affirm anywhere you like online and offline. It's gaining popularity, and we're very excited. And by the way, just to be very clear, this is very much V1. The road map for Debit+ spans years. We have a lot to build. So, this is not even remotely the final movement of that particular thing. I think the short answer is, no, we're not seeing particularly significant movement in either direction. Travel remains very strong."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Thanks. Yes. We are proud of the progress that we made in our pricing initiatives. Just to recap on how this works, the first step for us is getting any caps in the way \u2013 getting those caps out of the way, allowing us to price where we think we need to price always underneath 36. We were subject to a number of 30% APR caps. And so, one potential way to read that is there are 6 points. However, we don't intend to price every one with that amount so there is a reasonable limit to expect. That being said, we're about halfway rolled out and we've got about a point. So, I think a fair rule of thumb would be to double our progress today and that's a good ending spot. In terms of the impact that those pricing initiatives have on approvals is absolutely the case that we get to approve more consumers, drive better conversion for our merchant partners, and grow our business faster by being able to price loans in that zone. And that is our intent. Our intent would be to leverage that to protect asset yields for our investors and still approve more volume. And part of the reason why we've seen the acceleration in our direct-to-consumer business is because of how we've been operating it, frankly, since we've been able to get that moved first ahead of any, sort of merchant interaction. Yes, thanks. We had obviously a really strong quarter on revenue less transaction costs in Q3 driven in large part by our outperformance in credit. That resulted in a pretty large be ahead of our expectations in the provision for losses. And that was despite operating in a very volatile capital markets. We assume that Q4 will remain volatile. That's not to say that isn't a spot where we can add capacity. We do intend to add capacity like we do almost every quarter, but it does mean that we're being very thoughtful around what we assume as we prepare a forecast in the guidance that we don't aren't overly reliant on things getting better in the debt capital markets for us. What that means for us is a little bit more of a reliance or usage of our warehouse funding mechanisms into our fourth quarter. And as you see in the GMV guidance, we're showing pretty strong sequential GMV growth from Q3 to Q4. In fact, from a seasonality perspective, I think even faster than what we saw last year, and as we saw during our second quarter, when you have that, kind of sequential growth in GMV or that acceleration quarter-to-quarter, it can sometimes push some of the economics for loans originating in the quarter and the subsequent quarters. And the reason why Q3's outperformance was so strong was in part because of the \u2013 both the volume and balance sheet strategies we had used in Q2. So, follow the markets that we think we're going to be able to continue to navigate to fund and scale the business, but will change the shape of the earning a little bit and what we saw in Q3 versus Q2, we kind of expect to see in Q1 of next year against Q4 this year. Yes, we haven't broken anything out because it's not big yet. We do intend to give you better tools to model it when we have it becoming a more material part of our business. And because we're not providing any guidance in 2024, we're not doing that today. But as we talked about before, there's really two different pieces to that product. One is, it will look more like our direct-to-consumer product that we have today just looks like an installment loan. Whether that's a paying for or a monthly installment loan, the other would be a P&L volume, which of course will have a very different margin structure. And later this calendar year we plan on walking everyone through how to think about modeling it and the impact it has on the P&L. Lost Jason. Operator, I think we need another. We lost you. Please repeat that. Yes. Really proud of the credit results in the business and given the very short duration of our asset, the real time performance of the portfolio drives the allowance calculation for Affirm. So, what we're not doing is, making estimates of where the economy will be in a year and building balances for that. Because by the time we get there, of course our asset turns over too fast, there'll be very little of any principal left on the balance sheet or outstanding with even forward flow partners by the time you get there. And so, we don't think about credit as a long-term estimate, instead, we think about it as a more near-term reflection of the actual performance of the credit that we have out. And given our really strong delinquency performance, measured however you'd like, the allowance rate has continued to come down and we would expect that to be in-line with historical patterns from here. The seasonal factors that come into play are a little bit, it's a little bit inverted. The biggest seasonal factor is the depressed delinquency numbers you see in and around tax return season. And so, as you get past that, you start to normalize up a little bit. We would expect to follow the seasonal trends, pretty much directly on our regular credit monitoring shows being right on top of the historical patterns here and feel very confident about staying within those [bands] [ph]. We're not going to provide any numbers broken out. But what I can say is that we had exceptionally strong growth in a couple of pockets. Our largest partners grew really quickly, including our partnerships with platforms like Shopify where we actually saw an acceleration in the business. We also had a real acceleration in our direct-to-consumer business, which is obviously away from merchants like Amazon. And yet, we showed really strong growth with Amazon as well. Yes. So with respect to equity capital, it is creeping up and above our long-term goal of 5% and nowhere near 10%. We don't intend to run the business anywhere near that number. I think we said that last quarter, I'll just keep repeating it and thank you for the question because it's \u2013 I know it's on people's minds. We don't want to run a business with that much equity capital. Today, we have a pretty low leverage, let's say a low advanced rate funding strategy with our warehouse lines, for example, And that's a lever that we could pull in the future if we continue to feel like we're operating in this environment and need to use balance sheet, but today it hasn't been a priority for us because, firstly, we have adequate liquidity with over $2 billion of cash and securities available for sale and obviously our economics on loans that we put on the balance sheet actually do return higher to us overall. And so those two factors were not really too worked up around it today, something that the team will get work on in the future if the current market continues to operate like this. In terms of the total loan economics in this funding environment, we feel really good about it. You saw this quarter's revenue less transaction costs being a little over the midpoint of the 3% to 4% range that we've talked about. We're going to oscillate quarter-to-quarter with an \u2013 or and admittedly high degree of volatility, but none of that takes away from our confidence in that 3% to 4% range. If you think about the question that was asked at the very top of the call, our ability to get those pricing initiatives over the line and realize will offset a healthy amount of the headwind that we're experiencing in the capital markets broadly. Yes. So, the good news about the capital markets is that we demonstrated in our 23A deal and the recent reopening that when structured correctly and timed correctly, we're able to access the ABS market, I think, really constructively. The \u2013 qualitatively, the investor sentiment was exceptionally positive in our 23A reopening. Our team did a really good job in working with investors and executing in that market. Quantitatively, that particular transaction was 3x oversubscribed. And those are all really positive signals, but it's important to put that transaction in context of the broader capital markets and macroeconomic conditions. We did that transaction in between the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and the sale of First Republic. And I think that it is the case that these things do not impact us directly on a first order basis, but credit spreads for all asset classes, including ours, are going to widen in times of these moments of pretty peak economic dislocation. It is just an unfortunate reality of the world right now that things are extremely volatile. That being said, we did execute those two transactions I mentioned in between these pretty severe economic events. And we are confident that we can continue to do so, but nonetheless, it will remain volatile. We're also adding net new partners in our funding ecosystem, adding warehouse funding capacity from net new institutions and expanding existing relationships with our existing funding partners. And I would just leave you with the idea that it's volatile. And obviously, spreads are widening, and that will offset some of what we expect to be a declining rate environment going forward. But nonetheless, still able to fund the business, which is always job one for our capital team, and we've done that excellently. Yes. We still feel very confident about 3% to 4%. In the long run, this quarter was again, the higher-end of that range and also ahead of our expectations that we had provided guidance for in February. And yet, we do forecast a sequential reduction in that as a percentage of GMV into next quarter. But again, I think the two factors to think about are when we have a sequential growth in GMV and we use our warehouse funding, that means that we provide the provision for the loans that originated upfront. And we are a little bit back in how those earn. And that is very similar to what you saw in Q3. We were benefiting in Q3 from the origination and balance sheet strategy in Q2. And we'd anticipate a similar trend to play out for Q4 versus Q3. And then separately, it is just the case that we have a very volatile capital market. So, our guidance is always going to try to assume what we think we have a high degree of confidence in. And we have a lot of sensitivity to our ability to execute there. And so, when we think about building guidance and our forecast, we're pretty careful about making sure we have, in the model, the deals that we expect to be able to complete in the quarter. Yes. On the first, I don't think that we're ever going to get to 100%. So, complete is probably like never. I mean, we're going to keep moving forward and try to continue to expand it, but we don't expect to ever be at 100% of our merchants for a variety of reasons we can go into. But we do anticipate continuing to make progress with respect to merchant amendments to allow us to go up to 36%. So, we've a lot of wood left to chop, and we're going to keep working on that between now and the rest of this calendar year. When you think about what that does for approvals, it's a pretty simple answer with really complicated math. The simple answer is, we try to maintain the same level of unit profitability. And so, the extra revenue allows us to approve proportionately more and offsetting the associated credit losses you'd expect in those marginal populations. And we do think about it on a portfolio basis. And so, it is obviously something that allows us to create a lot more economic yield across the portfolio and approve more consumers as a result. It is also the case that we need some of that to offset the rising cost of funding and maintain the unit economics that we need. So, not all of it will go to expanded approvals. And certainly, there are a set of approvals that we simply can't and don't want to approve, right? We don't \u2013 a consumer defaulting on a loan is a bad outcome that we seek to avoid. And so, we're never going to recklessly improve a consumer who we think will. That being said, it is the current posture of the business given the credit tightening that we've done do allow us to be expansionary with any 36% cap. Yes. And other color on the quarter. We mentioned our strength in direct-to-consumer, our guidance definitely points to that trend continuing where we also have strength in some of our largest partnerships that are either accelerating or still growing at very, very fast clips. And travel and ticketing remains a real bright spot. We continue to see weakness in sporting goods overall. Although as we get through the next quarter, we do have what used to be our largest partner, will now be less than 1% of our GMV going forward and becomes very trivial. And so some of the sporting goods headwind will become a lot less of an impact in the GMV growth rate of the business. And then obviously, categories like home and lifestyle and electronics continue to be in a pretty suppressed levels when thinking about their comparisons. We do think that as you get to Q3 of next fiscal year, when we get to about 9 months from now, you will begin to lap a lot easier comps. And so, we're optimistic that by the time we get there, some of those businesses will return to some solid growth. But for now, the headwinds there continue. We do plan on giving a very detailed breakdown for investors later this year, not today. But again, think about the products, GMV, the stuff that looks like installment loans will sit within our framework today because they are very similar loans, and they should have similar economics, some more funding requirements, similar \u2013 it's more of what we do every day. The volume that we call pay now that comes out of the consumers' accounts a few days after they swipe the card, those will have different economics. Today, that's not the majority of the volume running on the card. But we'll watch that closely and give investors a way to think about modeling that as it becomes material. It's a good question. So, as you saw in this quarter and our guidance kind of implies, we expect to continue to drive real leverage in G&A. Sales and marketing on a non-GAAP adjusted basis will continue to be slightly volatile in that some of our co-marketing commitments are a little bit more episodic.  So, you'll see that number kind of bounce around a little bit. But over time, still showing re-levered. But the area of the business that we do intend to continue to invest in is tech data analytics that enables growth in the business both in the near term, enabling us to add infrastructure and acquire more data, but also hire engineers and product managers to build product to change the world. And so, we are going to keep doing that, and we intend to keep our foot on the gas with the technology side of the business and showing leverage in the other parts. We've not given a framework for what that means in terms of bottom line profitability growth or the trend of adjusted operating income, but we do intend to update investors on that later this year."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nZane Keller: Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them, except as required by law. In addition, today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings supplement slide deck, which is available on our Investor Relations website. Hosting today's call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us. I hope you've had a chance to review our letter to shareholders as it contains a great deal of detail. Amidst increased macroeconomic headwinds, our fiscal Q2 had mixed results. Revenue was at the low end of our expected range and adjusted operating income came in better than expected. On the other hand, gross merchandise volume was short of expectations as was revenue less transaction costs as our mix shifted to more interest-bearing loans and we retain more loans on the balance sheet. We once again reported excellent credit performance as delinquencies fell on a sequential basis. Our continued vigilance and attention to credit outcomes allowed us to meaningfully increase our funding capacity in January. We also acknowledge a tactical error on our part that hurt our results. We began increasing prices for our merchants and consumers later in the year than we should have as this process has taken us longer than we anticipated. This is a lesson we will not soon forget, though it does not change our long-term outlook at all. We have taken appropriate action from implementing pricing initiatives, which are gaining traction, to refocusing our product development effort on margin optimization and core growth to the most difficult decision of all, reducing the size of our team by 19% today. I believe this is the right decision as we have hired a larger team that we can sustainably support in today's economic reality, but I am truly sorry to see many of our talented colleagues depart and we'll be forever grateful for their contributions to our mission. With a smaller, therefore, nimbler team, we are focused on achieving profitability on an adjusted operating income basis as we exit fiscal 2023 by executing on three key initiatives: accelerating GMV growth while optimizing RLTC; engaging consumers to drive greater frequency and repeat usage; and growing Debit+. We continue executing on our strategy to scale our network, make disciplined high conviction bets in our most promising opportunities and capitalize on our massive secular tailwinds. Anybody wants to ask me about the recently proposed rule on [indiscernible], please go for it. We'll head to Q&A now. Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller: Thank you, Max. With that, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question this evening. I was wondering on the new pricing actions that rolled in a little bit late, what do you see there typically in terms of attrition or other impacts kind of downstream when you go about rolling those in? Is that a risk factor for later? Or do you have a pretty good idea in terms of what to expect as you roll those pricing actions in over the course of the next few months?\nMax Levchin: We have seen zero attrition that I can think of. Michael will sort of correct me. But it is not a matter of risk of implementation, but it is very much a matter of timing. The process is a little bit more complicated than, in some cases, any way than simply notifying someone because for a large percentage of our merchants, they utilize something or anything in our set of offerings as far as buying down rates is concerned. So the conversation isn't just, hey, we need to raise prices on consumers or you need to pay us more MDR. It's inevitably a conversation about how the programs change, what buydowns will look like going forward now that there is a different construct in front of the consumer. For example, you might see \u2013 we now have a significantly more visible set of 4% and 5% APR is not a product or not a program that we featured last year at all, et cetera. So it's a matter of underestimating complexity on our part. And the other unfortunate reality is that having these conversations in calendar Q4 with merchants is just not something that happens very quickly. So we don't have much risk in those conversations, but the timing made a little difference. And then I think it's also important to know that from a consumer price standpoint, we continue to believe that there is very minimal elasticity. So in thinking about the impact on the top line and the top of the funnel, we don't think there is a measurable impact there.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. One quick follow-up for me. I also noted that more of your GMV was coming from interest-bearing loans, and as you called out, the highest ratio in the corporate history. Can you just kind of comment on how we should expect that to trend going forward? Is that a rate that should continue to increase? Or I've noticed that I've seen some, for example, some 0% loans on the Amazon website that hadn't seen in the past. Could we expect that to kind of come in?\nMax Levchin: I think it's, generally speaking, reasonable to expect as the Fed rate continues to go up or at least remains high or elevated relative to last year to see more interest-bearing loans versus zeros. That said, the subsidies to reduce the rates or eliminate them entirely come from both merchants and platforms as well as manufacturers, et cetera. And so overall, the trend should be expected to be towards more interest-bearing loans, but we're certainly still very much in the business of finding ways of offering consumers magical deals that contain no interest at all, which is obviously far more valuable now that the overall borrowing cost for consumers went up a lot.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.\nRob Wildhack: Hi, guys. The new guidance, especially in the second half of 2023, points to lower volume and revenue growth in RLTC that's actually going to be down year-over-year. I know you stuck to the profitability target, but how are you thinking about the longer-term margin and profitability of the business? And how do you get there given that the growth seems to be slowing before you really hit an escape velocity?\nMichael Linford: Yes, that's a great question. We continue to believe that the long-term range of the revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV should be in the 3% to 4% range. I think what \u2013 you have a couple of factors going on in Q2 with respect to the timing of how we earn the revenue and how we recognize the expense that distorts it. And given the \u2013 that what we think is a one-time step-up in loans that are held for investment through our warehouse financing growth, we think that obviously will weigh down the full year number, but still allow us to end up in the 3% to 4%. And the reason for that is, as we've talked about before, the business is really a mix of split pay, paying for volume, which has margins that are much lower, and very profitable longer-term monthly installment and the two mix in a way where we can pretty reliably predict that 3% to 4%. Additionally, I'd point out that we feel really good about the quality of the assets that we originated this quarter. And as I say, the economic content there is really good. That hasn't been a primary driver. Most of what you're seeing is, again, how those yields flow through the P&L.\nRob Wildhack: Thanks. If I could just follow up there similar question but more from an operating profit standpoint. The long-term target, I think, used to be a 20% or 30% operating margin when GMV growth was below 30%. You're kind of there now, but still have a lot of fixed costs to scale. So from an operating profit standpoint, how do you think about the longer-term margin here?\nMichael Linford: Yes. We've not given any update to the framework that we laid out last year. I think that we would probably say we're in the midst of one of the biggest kind of moments of volatility from a macro sense. So, not sure that we would hold ourselves to the framework that we outlined a year and a half ago in this very moment. But I think part of the reason we laid out our profitability commitment to the end of the year was a reflection of the fact that we were wanting to get ahead of that from a framework standpoint.\nMax Levchin: Just for the record, this is not the growth rate that I personally like. We intend to grow the business faster. So the expectation of where they are now is not the expectation that I have for this business. That said, we will manage credit, most importantly as job number zero. Like we will never allow growth trump the necessity of managing losses, and yields, et cetera. But there is absolutely no reason to believe that having taken over a quarter of U.S. retail sales, we're going attenuate and match some steadiest gross growth rate. \nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. I wanted to explore the long term profitability question again. But from the viewpoint I feel like I've heard you say at conferences like one of the biggest toggle points is, is really kind of the human capital aspect of your business and you obviously just did a very large reduction of force here. So my question is that seems to be helpful today, but to the extent that you're able to sustain long-term profitability, are you going to have to lean into something that requires a lot more automation on your part and are you doing that or are you just trying to match, obviously right now, obviously you're kind of matching an expense versus a downdraft in the top line, but I'm thinking about this longer term from a sustainability perspective. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Couple of different thoughts on that. The rift is very unfortunate and certainly saddens me greatly and the rest of the team. It is an economic reality that we have to live within our means and match growth of headcount with growth of revenue. But for the record, what we've done is we've rolled back six months of engineering hiring. This is not a \u2013 everything is going to be replaced by robots and we're writing a lot of code and we'll continue to do so. We have definitely shifted our geographic hiring focus to Poland where we've been able to attract exceptional talent at significantly lower cost than Silicon Valley, for example. We have a lot of things that we want to build and we'll certainly expect ourselves to build it and deliver it. What we're doing right now is not building all those things concurrently. What we've really done is reduce the surface area of engineering projects we're allowing ourselves to invest in, which a year and half ago or two years ago was exactly the right strategy. And I stand by those decisions. Today, it's a little bit tougher to justify having things that will create the next billion dollar business three years from now built today. We'll have to build it a year from now.\nDan Perlin: Got it. If I could just do a quick follow-up on the pricing initiatives. The question here is really, as you increase APRs up to 36% is the cap. And then you are also, I guess, toying with the idea of increasing MDRs on the 0% APRs, which kind of puts a burden on merchants. I'm just wondering, do you kind of foresee any, I guess, diminishing returns associated with that. From a merchant perspective, I know you have to get some approvals it sounds like, in order for you to actually take those caps up. But I'm just wondering how those discussions have gone and what that kind of feels like from a merchant perspective.\nMax Levchin: I think everyone, merchants and firm alike are keen on more volume. And I've repeated often, and I'll say it again, we are fundamentally governed by yield and risk management. So we must maintain the risk frameworks that we've signed up with our capital partners. If we are able to increase the compensation we get for taking the risk and we really do think of it in terms of MDR/APR trade off. There are many situations where the merchant is more than willing to pick up the increased cost because they want to pass the savings onto the consumer and attract them this way, but obviously works really well for folks with direct-to-consumer brands where maybe manufacturing is partially owned or fully owned. And in other situations where the brand is already paying us minimal possible and is unable to shoulder anymore, then it's the consumer that has to see increase rates. In either of those two cases, if we are able to raise the rates, we will increase approvals. Like this is fundamentally not about expanding a margin. We're quite comfortable with the margin structure that Michael outlined. We continue targeting those RLTC percentages. But being able to talk to our merchants about helping them sell more in a period of obvious consumer slowdown is a pretty welcome conversation. It is not in every case anyway, is it a, hey, well we're just going to go do this because again, we run complex programs. Part of why this business is so defensible is because vast majority of our merchants have significantly more to do with us than just showing up our logo on their checkout. If you look at their product details pages, you'll see that there are pre-quals and various forms of finding out the true cost to the consumer, which has to be updated for regulatory, and just marketing purposes, et cetera. So it's a more complicated thing to execute than perhaps meets the eye, but it is not a difficult conversation with the merchant. And as Michael pointed out, we've run the 36 versus 30 sensitivity tests last year and found that our consumers are actually smart enough to realize that when there are no fees, there are fixed schedules and there is no compounding difference between 30 and 36 on a $240 loan over 12 months is $0.70 a month. So, the true cost to consumer is practically de minimis on a cash basis, and our merchants are smart enough to understand that as well.\nMichael Linford: I think it's important to note that our direct-to-consumer channel, where we have complete control, is probably the best insight into where like the structural economics are here. And that's our most profitable product and channel. We have a very efficient way to engage and monetize that engagement in our app. And I think Max's opening remarks pointed out that one of the ways we're getting to our goals is by driving that engagement back to our own services where we can very profitably engage consumers and we're in full control of that experience.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you guys. I just wanted to start on GMV. I'm just looking at the new outlook there. You talked in the shareholder letter about some slowdown in discretionary consumer spending, but just wanted to take your temperature on how much of the lower outlook on the volume is that versus other factors, whether it be competition or just some tightening of the credit box. And then if you can just talk about what you see ultimately reaccelerating the GMV growth, because I think, the mass suggests you'll be down around 13% or 14% in the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: That's a great question. So, the discretionary spend is down. We get a pretty good preview of what that looks like, especially around Christmas shopping and Black Friday from our seats, electronics were down about 11%, homewares and supports equipment in particular, were hovering in the negative high 30s. So there's quite a lot of \u2013 I'm not sure of the right word to use, but folks are digesting the purchases they made during the pandemic. And I think those are not transactions that will disappear forever, but I think they are probably going to remain muted for, we expect at least a few quarters of that. On the flip side, credit is always an input. We set the loss rate that we're willing to live with and our capital partners are willing to live with, and then we manage everything towards that that's why the delinquencies are as good as they look. We have total control and we are willing to compromise GMV, although don't have to compromise too much of it to maintain industry winning loss rates. And so I'm not sure I'm prepared to give you a breakdown, but those are the two fundamental reasons consumers are pulling back their spend. Every time I talk to my friends CEOs of broadline retailers, they tell me that discretionary spend is down. There is quite a lot of movement into things like consumables and obviously food prices being higher does not help either. To the re-acceleration point, obviously we've talked for a long time about Debit + I'm sure somebody will ask me and I'll give you a full update on what's going on there, but I remain very, very bullish on that. We've worked really hard over the last six months. It's hard to overstate just how much work went into the product just over the last couple of quarters. We feel very good about its state of readiness and we'll start fighting out just how much of that food and consumable spend we're going to be able to shift to Affirm. Our consumers still love us, they still come back to us. You can see that the frequency per user is rising. The network activity is extremely healthy. I think probably the set of metrics that I would direct all of you to look at if you wanted \u2013 how does a firm win story spelled out very clearly. There's almost a 40% growth in active consumers year-over-year, almost 40% growth in transactions, 3.5 transactions per year per active user, 51% growth in transactions themselves and 86% up slightly from last one is the repeat transactions.  And so, the network itself is increasing density, and that is fundamentally the long term play. Like if we are able to pick up more and more of your transactions, we will ultimately have a really good shot at also helping you buy groceries. And that is transactions that do not, generally speaking, diminish much in the positive and negative economic environment. So that is where the real reacceleration will come from. We\u2019re also selling to more merchants and launching new projects and new products with them. So that, too, will bear fruit. But in terms of new categories, off-line and lower AV transactions off-line in particular, is where I\u2019m most excited about.\nJason Kupferberg: And then just quickly on Amazon, I think the exclusivity provision of the contract expired January 31. Just any updates there? Thanks again.\nMax Levchin: I think the world where you can lock up your partners with a 10-year contract and not do much after that is \u2013 that\u2019s left to card issuing banks. We\u2019re not one of those. The way we maintain our partnerships and hopefully, have a rate to continue showing up is by showing up and delivering real value every day. I think we feel very good about all of our enterprise partnerships.\nMichael Linford: Yes. Just real quick. In our Q, you\u2019ll see we are breaking down the concentration that you see for Amazon. And I think we are \u2013 we have a meaningful exposure there. We are a little over 20% of our GMV. That is still underpenetrated versus Amazon\u2019s share of e-commerce. So, we still feel like we have a lot of room to grow there. And nothing happened to our business on to Max\u2019s earlier point, on the day the contract terms turned over.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Please proceed.\nRayna Kumar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just looking at your FY 2023 guidance, you\u2019re calling for cut at the midpoint on revenue of 8% and transaction costs to be cut by 2% at the midpoint. Just wondering what that \u2013 why there\u2019s that big differential. Any call-outs there?\nMichael Linford: Sorry. Is your question why are we able to...\nRayna Kumar: Why are you cutting revenue more than the transaction costs?\nMichael Linford: Okay. Yes. I think we \u2013 the guidance for the back half of the year, transaction cost does reflect continued some volatile macroeconomic conditions, including and especially the capital markets where we would continue to expect there to be a lot of pressure on the yields that we need to generate for our capital partners. I think that\u2019s reflected in the guide. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s happening to us. The thing that we\u2019re doing about it is the pricing initiatives that Max alluded to. I think we\u2019d feel better about the world, have that already been in the ground and reflected in the mix of GMV that we\u2019re originating. And so we do expect that continue to be a source of pressure on us in the near-term.\nRayna Kumar: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just one follow-up. If you can just provide us an update on how the Shopify partnership is ramping and how that runway for growth looks like from here?\nMax Levchin: We\u2019re very happy with the Shopify relationship. Sort of the headline answer is, these things take a long time to build out. It\u2019s just sort of \u2013 again, I love being our \u2013 just a little bit about the complexity of this business as a moat, but it really is that. It typically takes us two years to three years to get to kind of a full deployment because it\u2019s such an interesting beast. You have to figure out how to promote the product the right way, and yet you can\u2019t over promote it because then you\u2019re going to be pushing people into death where they shouldn\u2019t be. And so there\u2019s a lot of finesse to figuring out how to get to a full sort of a fully deployed mode. And you know you\u2019re there when you\u2019re seeing kind of a 1% [ph] improvement and not better than that. And we\u2019re still in a really happy position where we can roll out an improvement or a project with Shopify; the meaningful improvements come out in GMV or in profitability of the program, et cetera. So we\u2019re still very much at work. We have a significant percentage of our effort dedicated to what we call PBA Powered by Affirm [ph], that\u2019s the component come more in treat that powers both Shopify and several other platforms for us. And we\u2019re still very significantly invested in building that out. There\u2019s still quite a lot of opportunity there. So generally speaking, very excited, great relationship. Spend a lot of time talking to my counterparts there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hey guys. Appreciate taking the question this afternoon. Michael, by all accounts, it would appear that capital markets are maybe healing a little bit, and equity as a percent of the total funding platform is up pretty substantially quarter-on-quarter. So, I guess a couple of questions. One, how do you sort of assess the state of the capital markets from a funding standpoint? I noticed you expanded capacity. And two, do you think you\u2019re going to be able to stay below that sort of 10% pre-IPO equity funding threshold through the cycle?\nMichael Linford: Yes. So the first question first. The markets are healing. I think that the New Year did an awful lot for the debt capital markets broadly. And you\u2019re seeing the ABS market open up. You\u2019re seeing much more constructive conversations with forward flow partners. Max and I spent a lot of time over the past couple of weeks meeting with couple of partners of all stripes. And the tone is just markedly better than where it was as the volatility appeared to be reducing, and the New Year really did help. So, we feel much better today, and yet we are still very much humbled around just how difficult it is to execute and how volatile and uncertainty remains. You saw the whipsaw this week in around the Fed meeting. And I think that kind of volatility is something we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re prepared to and comfortable at navigating, but it does reflecting us being very thoughtful and careful about how we run the business. With respect to your second question, absolutely, we will stay below 10%. We think this is near the high watermark for where that number should be. We think that the seasonality of our GMV, specifically the holiday shopping season late in the quarter and then, of course, in the quarter itself, causes an increase, a pretty big step-up in total platform portfolio that we don\u2019t think will continue to grow as quickly to the back half of the year, which means that our funding mix will probably be very stable through the back half of the fiscal year. So you wouldn\u2019t expect any meaningful increases in that equity capital required. And we would continue to feel confident in our ability to execute both securitization like we did earlier in January as well as net new capacity with forward flow partners. And so we feel good about our ability to do that right now as we sit here today, but nowhere near 10%.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. And as a follow-up, wondering about \u2013 pardon me, I lost my train of thought. Yes, on the loan loss reserve, I know it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ve admonished as not to necessarily consider that as we would a more traditional financial, but can you just discuss sort of the 5% reserve and where you think that goes in the current environment should it fall given the slowdown in growth?\nMichael Linford: I think 5% is a really good number. I think it is obviously linked to delinquencies. And again, I apologize if this comes off as a admonished. It\u2019s really not. It\u2019s just a chance to learn about how this business works. We have a target \u2013 in my letter, I would really encourage everyone to look at it. It shows the delinquency trends at Affirm as compared to some of those traditional players whose measures, I think, some folks are wanting to apply to our business. We\u2019re the only player with the line on delinquencies pointing down, okay? And some players are not as high as others, but the directionality is very different. And that\u2019s because our asset turns over so fast that you\u2019re not building for losses for loans that you have. And it\u2019s somewhat of a cheeky statement, but we can\u2019t build allowance for loans that we don\u2019t own. And so we can\u2019t build ahead originations that haven\u2019t happened yet. And what you see here then isn\u2019t a judgment about how the back book will deteriorate in the macroeconomic environment. It is a reflection of the quality of loans that have originated recently given the velocity of the book. And so what you should interpret as the 5% is very much connected to that declining delinquency trend that you see. That\u2019s a reflection of extremely strong credit performance, much more so than anything else. Lastly, we included a chart in the supplement that I would encourage folks to look at, it just breaks out where the allowance bridge two from September to December and then, again, where the last 12 months have gone. And you\u2019ll see the allowance build is a reflection of both growth and assets, but also the actual charge-offs in the period.\nMax Levchin: Just I don\u2019t mean for it to be admonishment either, but I will attempt to say exactly what Michael said in a probably less careful way, but I think it\u2019s really important to understand the whole point of including this chart. It\u2019s not as though our consumers are experiencing less or more stress on average, is that we have through the really short-term nature of the product that we print, and the fact that we decide every loan individually where we think we are not able to take the risk, we don\u2019t. And the downward slope of delinquency is a direct result of our action. We changed our credit posture sometime starting maybe nine months ago, and we\u2019ve done it again several times since, sometimes with finesse and other times somewhat more actively. But the point is, we are in control of the credit outcomes and we\u2019ll continue controlling them. And that\u2019s really, really important to understand. We\u2019re not building allowances for the mistakes we made that we couldn\u2019t have predicted three years ago by giving someone a credit card. We make the decision every single time they choose to transact, has a direct consequence of GMV might be lower because we decided the GMV that is coming to us is higher risk than we want to take on. But we do rank risk really well. Reducing GMV a little bit eliminates a tremendous amount of potential loss, and we are in total control of what kind of loss we take on. That is the reason we included that is to just drive the message home. We\u2019re not interested in building up giant piles of cash for losses that will make from loans from three years ago, because we don\u2019t really have a whole lot of loans left from three years ago at all. I hope that didn\u2019t sound too admonishing.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBryan Keane: Hi, good afternoon. I guess just thinking big picture here, Michael, what surprised you versus the guidance you just laid out last quarter Was it the pullback and consumer spend? Was it that you thought the pricing would get all pushed through? Was it the mix of loans? I\u2019m just trying to get a handle on the reduction in the guidance going forward and kind of the surprise in that caught you by surprise?\nMichael Linford: Yes, I think it really is the overall consumer demand, which shows up both in the aggregate GMV, but also the mix underneath that. And I think there\u2019s some good progress that we made. So for example, we were pretty happy to get our business with Peloton to actually to be ahead of where we thought it was going to be. There\u2019s a lot of strength of that program as they returned to some of the programs that we had from years before. And then there was a lot of real legitimate slowdown in the broad line merchants that we are very proud to partner with in some more of the durable goods categories. These are the larger considered purchases. And so I think we were surprised about that. And then frankly we continued to manage credit very tightly and we were probably and continue to be as Max alluded to, we\u2019re going to manage credit first, and that shows up on the positive side with really excellent credit performance, which ensures that we continue to access capital and our capital is not a constraint on the growth in our business, and yet it does create some short-term top line headwind.\nBryan Keane: Got it. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then Max, I\u2019ll take debate and ask about Debit+ the rollout there and the prospects of profitability. I know there was some hesitation worried about the profitability of Debit+, so maybe you can update on that as well? Thank you.\nMax Levchin: You couldn\u2019t have helped me out. Could not have set me up better for that one. Thank you. All right, so, sorry. All right. So the \u2013 I\u2019ll spare you the long story. But \u2013 so sometime about eight \u2013 seven or eight months ago, we rolled out a first kind of a seriously sized batch if you will, of cards to our existing users and began observing. So obviously you\u2019re rolling out a completely new set of credit programs, you\u2019re taking overnight or multi-day risk on PayNow transactions and a whole bunch of different things that we needed to watch. And it\u2019s the kind of thing that you can\u2019t really model because you just don\u2019t have any real background information. And so we did that and much to my chagrin, sometime by mid-summer, we knew that transactions we knew how to do, which is longer-term interest bearing and short-term pain for us. We\u2019re generally performing fine, but we encountered a whole bunch of types of transactions, and I certainly won\u2019t get into the details, but there are multiple modalities of using the card that were just fundamentally unprofitable. And as we were looking at the usage and the fact that the product is so sticky, consumers would literally shift from using Affirm in any other mode to using the card. The second they had access to it sort of debated the responsibility of rolling out a product that was inherently less profitable and in some modalities unprofitable to users who were very hungry for it. But we\u2019re not going to transact with the \u2013 our other product. And so we spent the last six months just drilling into profitability of Debit+, and there are people who know who they are. So I\u2019m not going to name them and embarrass them. But they spend an uncountable number of hours figuring out how to optimize. This is primarily machine learning work where you\u2019re figuring out things like probability of insufficient funds in someone\u2019s settlement accounts. And so it\u2019s a major body of work that was actually in the end faster than I expected. But the punchline is that I\u2019m very happy to report that now every class of transactions in Debit+ is profitable. And so to an enormous amount of optimization, again, one of these things where you look back and say, no one else will go through the trouble, they\u2019ll just print out some revolving line and move on. But our consumer doesn\u2019t want a revolving line. They won Debit+ and so very excited that this thing is profitable now. And the other thing a little bit less, but kind of even more in the weeds, we saw really good stickiness of the product once you comprehended the value proposition. But there\u2019s a bunch of wrinkles in onboarding in particular that lost too many people as we were trying to onboard them. And so we spend the remainder of the time in the last six months just figuring out how to make it as easy to get live with a card, like eliminating a huge number of steps while not losing anything in KYC and all the other things that we have to do. So both of those projects are basically completed. The way you know \u2013 you will know that we are mashing the pedal through the floor, as Michael likes to say, is you\u2019ll see Debit+ ceased to be its own separate application. So up until now, it\u2019s been a standalone app that you have to download. So we purposely put in a bunch of friction so that we would be able to control the spread. Now that we feel very good about the economics and the comprehensibility of the product, we\u2019re actually going to integrate it directly into the mainline app. I am not going to make the same mistake I did in the past and put a number out there. And I will do that internally, but the team knows exactly the pressure and excitement we have for the product. So, extremely bullish you\u2019ll see it in your app soon as the rest of the team is looking at me angrily. So that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\nMichael Linford: And remember, the Debit+ product is another one of these channels that we control entirely. So some of the profitability of the product is a function of that, and we feel really good about where that fits right now.\nOperator: Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Could you talk a little bit more about the \u2013 how much of your GMV you think will be on the balance sheet? You sort of talked a little bit about some of that versus what you\u2019d be able to sell and the idea of what in those discussions you were talking about that you\u2019re having with your capital markets partners. How much is their pricing to you changing and how much do you need to raise pricing to keep them perhaps where they had been prior to this range of interest rate increases?\nMichael Linford: Yes, it\u2019s two factors. There\u2019s interest rate increases and then there is credit. And I think we spent a lot of time on talking about why controlling credit is so important for the yield those investors get. And that is a point of pretty big differentiation when thinking about us versus some of the other alternatives that some of these forward flow partners could be buying. And as that differentiation grows, we know we\u2019ll get rewarded for it. And yet also we need \u2013 we do feel the need to increase the revenue content in the loans that we\u2019re selling in the form of higher APRs, for example. I think the \u2013 we\u2019re not giving specific guidance to the balance sheet or to the funding models through the back half of the year. But we do expect the mix that we saw in our second quarter to be pretty consistent with the mix that you would end the year at. So, I think it\u2019s safe starting point is to assume that we\u2019re flattish, which means we still have our largest funding channel is still going to be the forward flow market. That\u2019s where the most of the total platform portfolio will be sitting as a single channel. We did the securitization in the beginning of this quarter, which will allow us to grow that line item and yet that still is on the balance sheet with slightly more leverage than yet with the warehouses. So anyway, I would assume flat within \u2013 certainly within modeling errors is a good assumption, which means that our affordable partners are at the table and still dealing constructively and maintaining their level of commitment throughout the back half of the year.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks, Michael. Maybe just as a follow-up. When you gave the guidance for revenue less transaction cost, did you factor in kind of a better, worse or comparable level of gain on sale on the assets that\u2019ll be sold?\nMichael Linford: That\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s worse. So we\u2019ve contemplated that we would continue to have yield pressure with respect to our forward flow partners. We saw that in the pricing conversations that we\u2019ve had and been having. And while we\u2019re very confident about our ability to control the asset yields, as Max talked about it is the case that the rising rate environment has put the yield threshold higher for all of these programs.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Kevin, please check and see if your phone line is muted. Okay. We will move on to Chris Brendler with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.\nChris Brendler: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to try the volume question one more time, just to make sure I'm understanding correctly. Just relative to your expectations three months ago, is it fair to say that there was probably a little bit of consumer moving away from discretionary items, especially discretionary items that would be of a ticket size that would make an Affirm product? Is that \u2013 that's only part of it? What about the sort of the offset of increased consumer demand in a stressed macro environment? Is that still a factor? Or is it overall net negative what consumers are choosing to spend today? And I have a follow-up.\nMax Levchin: It's a great question. The pullback from discretionary spend is exactly right. I think I already rattled off a bunch of category drops that we are seeing year-on-year. And so that's certainly factual, and we do expect it to continue. Nobody knows when the trough of consumer demand has hit, but I don't feel like people are running out and buying couches all of February or January. But the demand for the program, I think, dropped a juicy stats in the opening part of my letter. We see about $1 billion of demand every week and I think that's not the same thing as well, great, why don't you guys take it because each one of these loans or each one of these applications has to be underwritten for \u2013 through the lens of what's responsible for us to take a risk on and what's responsible, frankly, for this person to borrow. So increasing consumer demand is certainly there. I think if we were careless, we could probably grow GMV to astronomical numbers quite quickly, but that is most certainly not what we're going to do. We are unique in a sense that we don't charge late fees. We do not profit from delinquencies. We did not celebrate late fee increases. And I'm glad there's some pressure downwards in that particular part of the world recently. So hopefully, the playing field is getting a little bit more level. But the demand is a good thing to have. I think we are now big enough where the overall consumer sentiment makes a deference to our business a little bit more than it used to. We're still growing 3 times the U.S. e-commerce rate. But as people walk away from buying more TVs, for example, it will have consequences. And so long as we are responsible lenders, we will feel a little bit of that.\nChris Brendler: Okay. Great. And then the follow-up would be sort of a clarification on sort of putting all these factors together, and correct me if I'm wrong here. But it sounds like consumers are experiencing BNPL burnout. To the extent that your last question or last answer suggests that there's still very much a lot of interest in BNPL, especially in this macro environment is not really consumers tiring of the product. It is more your line of skirmish [ph] calls on making sure you're using profitable loans. And because of the higher interest rate environment as well as higher sensitivity to credit costs, you pulled back maybe potentially at the bottom of the funnel, not at the top of the funnel, but more at the bottom of the funnel. And as you make pricing changes, that you could see a better conversion rate in the next fiscal year potentially. Is that fair?\nMax Levchin: That's exactly right. And actually, Michael, I'm stealing his line in this one, but he loves to remind everybody that our loans are ranked in profit \u2013 correlation between profitability of our loans and the internal credit score or FICO score, if you will, more or less, are tightly correlated. In other words, the highest credit quality loans are also most profitable for us. We are not using \u2013 pardon the craft statement, poor people to subsidize great deals or rich people who are actually attributing the cost and profitability quite directly, which means that any time we need to or we decide to improve the profitability of the book, we end up taking slightly less risk at the very bottom. The overall demand for the product is still very strong. We're not seeing any \u2013 I've had enough BNPL during the pandemic back to my, I'm not sure which credit card we\u2019ll step on here. But not seeing burnout. If anything, on the margin, I feel like there's demand for more flexibility. I think the one thing that we're probably seeing \u2013 this is a little bit more anecdotal, so take it with a little bit of grain of salt, but any experiments during Debit+, we looked at sensitivity and consumer demand for longer terms. And obviously, people always want longer terms because just a little bit less cash flow hit on a monthly basis. But as the overall economic environment softened and consumer pulled back, it seems that at least part of the full pullback is actually cash flow dependent versus kind of a general decluttering trend, which is also by the way happening.\nMichael Linford: Yes. And again we don't talk enough about this, but we should. We're growing at somewhere between 2 and 3 times. We estimate the U.S. e-commerce growth rate to be, and that's despite posting 115% growth in GMV last year. And so I think it's easy to think about \u2013 thinking that the industry has slowed down, but you have to put into context the overall scale that we got to and how we kind of got there a little bit more quickly. We still feel like it's underpenetrated, and we'll get to the kind of numbers that we talked about. I think some of the quarter growth rate numbers are a reflection of the comps. And again, the growth rate last year was buoyed up by the launch of three major programs, all happening at the same time. And we're quite proud that we were able to do that, but that doesn't mean that some of the growth rates need a little bit wider aperture to get an understanding of what's really going on. The fact that transaction counts are up 50% year-on-year suggest that consumers are not at all being burned out by very high demand for. We are figuring out a way to profitably serve those transactions.\nMax Levchin: Should have just quoted the transaction growth. I think that's the single highest growing metric actually in this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJames Faucette: Thanks. I want to ask a couple of follow-up questions, particularly the one that was just asked. It's understandable in terms of tightening the bottom of the funnel, as you said a little bit where appropriate to manage that. Any sense for how much that then cost you or introduces incremental friction to bring those people back, whether that'd be first-time applicants or people that have taking out multiple loans in the past, and for whatever reason just don't meet the criteria you're looking for, for that incremental one?\nMax Levchin: That is a great question and something that is extremely top of mind for me. So I spent a lot of my time staring at reengagement stats, which is why you see it in my top three priority, both in my letter and certainly communications to the company. So the good news there \u2013 so first of all you're exactly right. If you tell someone, sorry, no loan for you and it's the first transaction that is not agreed, first impression and we will have to work harder to get the consumer back. Perhaps even worse, you can imagine a, I've been a loyal customer for a very long time, and now he can no longer serve me. So we invest a tremendous amount of resources to both the communication of the clients and also trying to make sure that we can bring folks back where appropriate. And part of why we know so well that the rate sensitivity is not actually a major problem for our consumer, certainly at the bottom part of the credit funnel is because we tested tremendous amount of those communications and just various forms of reengaging the consumer in our own services where we have total control where, of course, we are able to raise prices and ask for significantly higher down payments and optimize the overall experience instead of saying no, we can say, yes. The long and short of it is the results are good. Probably not worth getting into without a whiteboard. But perhaps when we see each other in person, I'll show you. We'll probably have to publish a charge for everybody to see, but we've tested what happens when we re-contact the consumer that we have declined. And what do they do when we tell them, hey, you're now approved or when we tell them here's a different form of transaction that we can approve you for. And they're very encouraging in the sense that consumers, especially those that have used Affirm before, are not particularly hurt or offended by the decline because we think we do a pretty good job explaining what happened and are quite willing to come back and reapply. So I'm, on the margin, confident we'll be able to continue engaging those consumers, and you'll see us actually invest quite a lot in products that enable that reengagement. That's a huge push within the product road map in the next couple of quarters, really, but it is very much top of mind and not something that we think is just going to be available to us and take it for granted. So it's an area of extreme focus for me.\nJames Faucette: And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned a couple of times, particularly as it relates to the changes in pricing, et cetera, that some of those implementations took or price changes and work with the merchants took longer than expected and was more back and forth there maybe than you had anticipated. What is that \u2013 what are you being able to do so that in the future, like you've got more flexibility there and can move more dynamically as rates, you've got to imagine in the very long run, we're going to move around quite a bit? So just wondering how you're approaching that.\nMax Levchin: Yes. This is, if I have some egg in my face to clean off still, but this is the one. I saw myself a bit of a payments expert going back 30 years, and I think I still am, but I completely forgot the part where Visa and Mastercard, whenever they change rates where any network rule changes, they always operated in the six months schedule with a six months notice, and then there\u2019s a six months implementation window. And late summer we decided this is what\u2019s going to have to happen, and it in fact takes six months. And the way you do this right, is you structure these into the contracts, you make sure that these contracts stipulate both what happens when the rates go open, when the rates go down you make sure that, what the transition periods look like, et cetera. And this is, again somewhat embarrassingly our first effort of that kind. This is the lesson that we\u2019ve all now learned here. Certainly I am first in the line of the lesson learning, so I think you should not expect us to have to have another one of these apologizing sessions where we say, yes, we were going to change prices, but we took a lot longer than we thought. So, we\u2019ve now figured out or we\u2019ve learned how to price in the right amount of time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.\nEugene Simuni: Hi guys, good evening. I wanted to ask about the merchant counts actually. So see the data on the slight decrease in total merchant counts and understand that, that\u2019s driven by smaller merchants as you\u2019re showing in a very helpful disclosure on what\u2019s happening with the larger merchants. So even with the larger merchants, there\u2019s a pretty noticeable slowdown in kind of the incremental merchants added to the network. Just wanted to ask about that, what\u2019s sort of driving that in your view, and what\u2019s your expectation for that trend going forward? How important it is to the overall growth of your platform for that kind of number of larger merchants, let\u2019s say, to keep growing at a decent pace?\nMax Levchin: First of all, merchant count as a little bit of vanity network at our scale. I think Michael has a few promises in the letter. We\u2019re going to publish a slightly different metric to make sure it just shows kind of a true state of penetration. Huge merchants \u201cis a very countable set\u201d, and we are very well penetrated there, as I\u2019m sure all of you know. Mid-sized merchants are important because these are kind of leaps and bounds of volume that we\u2019re picking up, and that\u2019s where majority of our, if you will, hand-to-hand sales combat takes place these days and probably has been in the last few years. And so those are important. Little merchants are a little bit different. They sometimes become inactive, especially at the really small scale, become inactive over a course of a quarter. The true count of installed merchants or activated, but not necessarily active is significantly larger than a number we published and be easy to sort of have a even more inflated vanity metric here. But we\u2019re trying to be transparent here. So the growth of merchant base is kind of a set of weights for the weighted average total of GMV. Obviously GMV growth is what we are entirely focused on.\nEugene Simuni: Yes. Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then quick follow-up. I wanted to ask about the Affirm app and kind of the transactions that I initiated through your app, through your website. Think if I\u2019m kind of looking at these numbers correctly, the proportion of that has declined a little bit sequentially, but my question is really broader, sort of what are the \u2013 what are your initiatives around improving the engagement with the app and again, how important it is to keep investing in it and what are you doing to keep driving traffic through it?\nMax Levchin: Yes. Let, to be honest, I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head, whether it declined or, oh, yes, I guess it\u2019s slightly down quarter-on-quarter on the percentage basis. It is super important to us. So for the points of doubt, that is a thing that I care tremendously about. There\u2019s a little bit of equivalence between transactions that happen in our partner apps, for example, as we grow within Shopify that, or imagine that you can service those transactions both inside the Shopify app and in our own app. And we always route the consumer towards the most likely place of repayment because again, job number one, job number zero is making sure that credit metrics remain excellent. But the overall reengagement within the network is what we care about the most and our app and our site and our user extension and a bunch of other things. And most importantly, to me, at least right now, the card is where we are investing a huge percentage of our engineering cycles. The opposite required companion to the card in fact, the functionality is in the app. You\u2019re borrowing money in the app, you\u2019re not ever borrowing money than the card itself. And that is where we think a lot more of this for engagement will take place. There\u2019s some really cool experiments taking place there. I\u2019m staring at a spreadsheet titled Max\u2019s Top 20, which has 35 elements in it right now, which all the projects that we put in the motion over Christmas break with our Head of Consumer Products and we\u2019re shipping a couple of those every week now. So, I\u2019m very happy with the velocity of the experiments we\u2019re doing there.\nMichael Linford: And then there\u2019s just also some math that\u2019s really important when we are scaling programs like we are with the largest platforms and, e-commerce players and Amazon and Shopify as an example. All of that growth, all those transactions are obviously not starting, on our platform. And so a lot of growth is coming from there, which means that like, I\u2019m actually very impressed we\u2019ve been able to hold it as constant given, the rapid rise in growth in these partners. And so I think to Max\u2019s earlier point, that the health of the network is reflected in those engagement stats and the user stats and growth in transaction counts, and the fact that we\u2019re holding serve on the level of engagement through our properties today is a really encouraging sign given the growth that\u2019s happening away. As those growth rates attenuate, you\u2019re going to see our share pickup.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Bauch with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please proceed.\nAndrew Bauch: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to hone in on one of the comments in the shareholder letter here in where you say you\u2019re redirecting R&D efforts towards margin improving projects. I mean, I guess how much of that is tangible in the current guidance. And is it fair to assume that is a bottom line margin improvement variable rather than, any kind of shift to potential long-term RLTC numbers?\nMax Levchin: Yes. So the short answer is, when we talk about some of the speed of, for example, taking pricing, we would have a lot more of the impact in this year\u2019s guidance had we acted earlier and especially true given the size of the balance sheet that we\u2019re sitting on right now. So, we feel like there\u2019s a lot of very long, very big initiatives to improve the margin, and that is up in the revenue less transaction cost line item, much more so than in an OpEx. We feel like there\u2019s a lot of very big and structural improvements that we\u2019re going to be able to make, but they don\u2019t really show up in the vertical periods in Q3 and Q4 just given the timing of so many of, the flow-throughs for any moments on the balance sheet, for example. And so that\u2019s where the focus is. The effort is reflected in our guidance, but you\u2019re not going to see the full benefit of all of the efforts until the quarters play out in the back half of the calendar year.\nAndrew Bauch: Makes a lot of sense. And then the sensitivity that you guys have just historically provided of RLTC relative to rates, any material change in that than what was provided last quarter. I know that, that heading into fiscal first quarter, you had narrowed the range of impact in, given where rates could potentially go, but just want to double check on that one.\nMax Levchin: No material change. I think we\u2019re thankfully staring down what looks like a more flat rate curve, which I think is allowing us to focus our efforts on making sure we create profitable units at the kind of peak rate curve environment. But further stress above that would continue to have the same reaction in our framework.\nAndrew Bauch: Got it. Thank you guys.\nOperator: That is all the time that we have for the Q&A today. I would like to hand the conference back over for closing comments.\nZane Keller: Thank you everybody for joining today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thank you, Zane. We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us. I hope you've had a chance to review our letter to shareholders as it contains a great deal of detail. Amidst increased macroeconomic headwinds, our fiscal Q2 had mixed results. Revenue was at the low end of our expected range and adjusted operating income came in better than expected. On the other hand, gross merchandise volume was short of expectations as was revenue less transaction costs as our mix shifted to more interest-bearing loans and we retain more loans on the balance sheet. We once again reported excellent credit performance as delinquencies fell on a sequential basis. Our continued vigilance and attention to credit outcomes allowed us to meaningfully increase our funding capacity in January. We also acknowledge a tactical error on our part that hurt our results. We began increasing prices for our merchants and consumers later in the year than we should have as this process has taken us longer than we anticipated. This is a lesson we will not soon forget, though it does not change our long-term outlook at all. We have taken appropriate action from implementing pricing initiatives, which are gaining traction, to refocusing our product development effort on margin optimization and core growth to the most difficult decision of all, reducing the size of our team by 19% today. I believe this is the right decision as we have hired a larger team that we can sustainably support in today's economic reality, but I am truly sorry to see many of our talented colleagues depart and we'll be forever grateful for their contributions to our mission. With a smaller, therefore, nimbler team, we are focused on achieving profitability on an adjusted operating income basis as we exit fiscal 2023 by executing on three key initiatives: accelerating GMV growth while optimizing RLTC; engaging consumers to drive greater frequency and repeat usage; and growing Debit+. We continue executing on our strategy to scale our network, make disciplined high conviction bets in our most promising opportunities and capitalize on our massive secular tailwinds. Anybody wants to ask me about the recently proposed rule on [indiscernible], please go for it. We'll head to Q&A now. Back to you, Zane. We have seen zero attrition that I can think of. Michael will sort of correct me. But it is not a matter of risk of implementation, but it is very much a matter of timing. The process is a little bit more complicated than, in some cases, any way than simply notifying someone because for a large percentage of our merchants, they utilize something or anything in our set of offerings as far as buying down rates is concerned. So the conversation isn't just, hey, we need to raise prices on consumers or you need to pay us more MDR. It's inevitably a conversation about how the programs change, what buydowns will look like going forward now that there is a different construct in front of the consumer. For example, you might see \u2013 we now have a significantly more visible set of 4% and 5% APR is not a product or not a program that we featured last year at all, et cetera. So it's a matter of underestimating complexity on our part. And the other unfortunate reality is that having these conversations in calendar Q4 with merchants is just not something that happens very quickly. So we don't have much risk in those conversations, but the timing made a little difference. And then I think it's also important to know that from a consumer price standpoint, we continue to believe that there is very minimal elasticity. So in thinking about the impact on the top line and the top of the funnel, we don't think there is a measurable impact there. I think it's, generally speaking, reasonable to expect as the Fed rate continues to go up or at least remains high or elevated relative to last year to see more interest-bearing loans versus zeros. That said, the subsidies to reduce the rates or eliminate them entirely come from both merchants and platforms as well as manufacturers, et cetera. And so overall, the trend should be expected to be towards more interest-bearing loans, but we're certainly still very much in the business of finding ways of offering consumers magical deals that contain no interest at all, which is obviously far more valuable now that the overall borrowing cost for consumers went up a lot. Just for the record, this is not the growth rate that I personally like. We intend to grow the business faster. So the expectation of where they are now is not the expectation that I have for this business. That said, we will manage credit, most importantly as job number zero. Like we will never allow growth trump the necessity of managing losses, and yields, et cetera. But there is absolutely no reason to believe that having taken over a quarter of U.S. retail sales, we're going attenuate and match some steadiest gross growth rate. Couple of different thoughts on that. The rift is very unfortunate and certainly saddens me greatly and the rest of the team. It is an economic reality that we have to live within our means and match growth of headcount with growth of revenue. But for the record, what we've done is we've rolled back six months of engineering hiring. This is not a \u2013 everything is going to be replaced by robots and we're writing a lot of code and we'll continue to do so. We have definitely shifted our geographic hiring focus to Poland where we've been able to attract exceptional talent at significantly lower cost than Silicon Valley, for example. We have a lot of things that we want to build and we'll certainly expect ourselves to build it and deliver it. What we're doing right now is not building all those things concurrently. What we've really done is reduce the surface area of engineering projects we're allowing ourselves to invest in, which a year and half ago or two years ago was exactly the right strategy. And I stand by those decisions. Today, it's a little bit tougher to justify having things that will create the next billion dollar business three years from now built today. We'll have to build it a year from now. I think everyone, merchants and firm alike are keen on more volume. And I've repeated often, and I'll say it again, we are fundamentally governed by yield and risk management. So we must maintain the risk frameworks that we've signed up with our capital partners. If we are able to increase the compensation we get for taking the risk and we really do think of it in terms of MDR/APR trade off. There are many situations where the merchant is more than willing to pick up the increased cost because they want to pass the savings onto the consumer and attract them this way, but obviously works really well for folks with direct-to-consumer brands where maybe manufacturing is partially owned or fully owned. And in other situations where the brand is already paying us minimal possible and is unable to shoulder anymore, then it's the consumer that has to see increase rates. In either of those two cases, if we are able to raise the rates, we will increase approvals. Like this is fundamentally not about expanding a margin. We're quite comfortable with the margin structure that Michael outlined. We continue targeting those RLTC percentages. But being able to talk to our merchants about helping them sell more in a period of obvious consumer slowdown is a pretty welcome conversation. It is not in every case anyway, is it a, hey, well we're just going to go do this because again, we run complex programs. Part of why this business is so defensible is because vast majority of our merchants have significantly more to do with us than just showing up our logo on their checkout. If you look at their product details pages, you'll see that there are pre-quals and various forms of finding out the true cost to the consumer, which has to be updated for regulatory, and just marketing purposes, et cetera. So it's a more complicated thing to execute than perhaps meets the eye, but it is not a difficult conversation with the merchant. And as Michael pointed out, we've run the 36 versus 30 sensitivity tests last year and found that our consumers are actually smart enough to realize that when there are no fees, there are fixed schedules and there is no compounding difference between 30 and 36 on a $240 loan over 12 months is $0.70 a month. So, the true cost to consumer is practically de minimis on a cash basis, and our merchants are smart enough to understand that as well. That's a great question. So, the discretionary spend is down. We get a pretty good preview of what that looks like, especially around Christmas shopping and Black Friday from our seats, electronics were down about 11%, homewares and supports equipment in particular, were hovering in the negative high 30s. So there's quite a lot of \u2013 I'm not sure of the right word to use, but folks are digesting the purchases they made during the pandemic. And I think those are not transactions that will disappear forever, but I think they are probably going to remain muted for, we expect at least a few quarters of that. On the flip side, credit is always an input. We set the loss rate that we're willing to live with and our capital partners are willing to live with, and then we manage everything towards that that's why the delinquencies are as good as they look. We have total control and we are willing to compromise GMV, although don't have to compromise too much of it to maintain industry winning loss rates. And so I'm not sure I'm prepared to give you a breakdown, but those are the two fundamental reasons consumers are pulling back their spend. Every time I talk to my friends CEOs of broadline retailers, they tell me that discretionary spend is down. There is quite a lot of movement into things like consumables and obviously food prices being higher does not help either. To the re-acceleration point, obviously we've talked for a long time about Debit + I'm sure somebody will ask me and I'll give you a full update on what's going on there, but I remain very, very bullish on that. We've worked really hard over the last six months. It's hard to overstate just how much work went into the product just over the last couple of quarters. We feel very good about its state of readiness and we'll start fighting out just how much of that food and consumable spend we're going to be able to shift to Affirm. Our consumers still love us, they still come back to us. You can see that the frequency per user is rising. The network activity is extremely healthy. I think probably the set of metrics that I would direct all of you to look at if you wanted \u2013 how does a firm win story spelled out very clearly. There's almost a 40% growth in active consumers year-over-year, almost 40% growth in transactions, 3.5 transactions per year per active user, 51% growth in transactions themselves and 86% up slightly from last one is the repeat transactions.  And so, the network itself is increasing density, and that is fundamentally the long term play. Like if we are able to pick up more and more of your transactions, we will ultimately have a really good shot at also helping you buy groceries. And that is transactions that do not, generally speaking, diminish much in the positive and negative economic environment. So that is where the real reacceleration will come from. We\u2019re also selling to more merchants and launching new projects and new products with them. So that, too, will bear fruit. But in terms of new categories, off-line and lower AV transactions off-line in particular, is where I\u2019m most excited about. I think the world where you can lock up your partners with a 10-year contract and not do much after that is \u2013 that\u2019s left to card issuing banks. We\u2019re not one of those. The way we maintain our partnerships and hopefully, have a rate to continue showing up is by showing up and delivering real value every day. I think we feel very good about all of our enterprise partnerships. We\u2019re very happy with the Shopify relationship. Sort of the headline answer is, these things take a long time to build out. It\u2019s just sort of \u2013 again, I love being our \u2013 just a little bit about the complexity of this business as a moat, but it really is that. It typically takes us two years to three years to get to kind of a full deployment because it\u2019s such an interesting beast. You have to figure out how to promote the product the right way, and yet you can\u2019t over promote it because then you\u2019re going to be pushing people into death where they shouldn\u2019t be. And so there\u2019s a lot of finesse to figuring out how to get to a full sort of a fully deployed mode. And you know you\u2019re there when you\u2019re seeing kind of a 1% [ph] improvement and not better than that. And we\u2019re still in a really happy position where we can roll out an improvement or a project with Shopify; the meaningful improvements come out in GMV or in profitability of the program, et cetera. So we\u2019re still very much at work. We have a significant percentage of our effort dedicated to what we call PBA Powered by Affirm [ph], that\u2019s the component come more in treat that powers both Shopify and several other platforms for us. And we\u2019re still very significantly invested in building that out. There\u2019s still quite a lot of opportunity there. So generally speaking, very excited, great relationship. Spend a lot of time talking to my counterparts there. Just I don\u2019t mean for it to be admonishment either, but I will attempt to say exactly what Michael said in a probably less careful way, but I think it\u2019s really important to understand the whole point of including this chart. It\u2019s not as though our consumers are experiencing less or more stress on average, is that we have through the really short-term nature of the product that we print, and the fact that we decide every loan individually where we think we are not able to take the risk, we don\u2019t. And the downward slope of delinquency is a direct result of our action. We changed our credit posture sometime starting maybe nine months ago, and we\u2019ve done it again several times since, sometimes with finesse and other times somewhat more actively. But the point is, we are in control of the credit outcomes and we\u2019ll continue controlling them. And that\u2019s really, really important to understand. We\u2019re not building allowances for the mistakes we made that we couldn\u2019t have predicted three years ago by giving someone a credit card. We make the decision every single time they choose to transact, has a direct consequence of GMV might be lower because we decided the GMV that is coming to us is higher risk than we want to take on. But we do rank risk really well. Reducing GMV a little bit eliminates a tremendous amount of potential loss, and we are in total control of what kind of loss we take on. That is the reason we included that is to just drive the message home. We\u2019re not interested in building up giant piles of cash for losses that will make from loans from three years ago, because we don\u2019t really have a whole lot of loans left from three years ago at all. I hope that didn\u2019t sound too admonishing. You couldn\u2019t have helped me out. Could not have set me up better for that one. Thank you. All right, so, sorry. All right. So the \u2013 I\u2019ll spare you the long story. But \u2013 so sometime about eight \u2013 seven or eight months ago, we rolled out a first kind of a seriously sized batch if you will, of cards to our existing users and began observing. So obviously you\u2019re rolling out a completely new set of credit programs, you\u2019re taking overnight or multi-day risk on PayNow transactions and a whole bunch of different things that we needed to watch. And it\u2019s the kind of thing that you can\u2019t really model because you just don\u2019t have any real background information. And so we did that and much to my chagrin, sometime by mid-summer, we knew that transactions we knew how to do, which is longer-term interest bearing and short-term pain for us. We\u2019re generally performing fine, but we encountered a whole bunch of types of transactions, and I certainly won\u2019t get into the details, but there are multiple modalities of using the card that were just fundamentally unprofitable. And as we were looking at the usage and the fact that the product is so sticky, consumers would literally shift from using Affirm in any other mode to using the card. The second they had access to it sort of debated the responsibility of rolling out a product that was inherently less profitable and in some modalities unprofitable to users who were very hungry for it. But we\u2019re not going to transact with the \u2013 our other product. And so we spent the last six months just drilling into profitability of Debit+, and there are people who know who they are. So I\u2019m not going to name them and embarrass them. But they spend an uncountable number of hours figuring out how to optimize. This is primarily machine learning work where you\u2019re figuring out things like probability of insufficient funds in someone\u2019s settlement accounts. And so it\u2019s a major body of work that was actually in the end faster than I expected. But the punchline is that I\u2019m very happy to report that now every class of transactions in Debit+ is profitable. And so to an enormous amount of optimization, again, one of these things where you look back and say, no one else will go through the trouble, they\u2019ll just print out some revolving line and move on. But our consumer doesn\u2019t want a revolving line. They won Debit+ and so very excited that this thing is profitable now. And the other thing a little bit less, but kind of even more in the weeds, we saw really good stickiness of the product once you comprehended the value proposition. But there\u2019s a bunch of wrinkles in onboarding in particular that lost too many people as we were trying to onboard them. And so we spend the remainder of the time in the last six months just figuring out how to make it as easy to get live with a card, like eliminating a huge number of steps while not losing anything in KYC and all the other things that we have to do. So both of those projects are basically completed. The way you know \u2013 you will know that we are mashing the pedal through the floor, as Michael likes to say, is you\u2019ll see Debit+ ceased to be its own separate application. So up until now, it\u2019s been a standalone app that you have to download. So we purposely put in a bunch of friction so that we would be able to control the spread. Now that we feel very good about the economics and the comprehensibility of the product, we\u2019re actually going to integrate it directly into the mainline app. I am not going to make the same mistake I did in the past and put a number out there. And I will do that internally, but the team knows exactly the pressure and excitement we have for the product. So, extremely bullish you\u2019ll see it in your app soon as the rest of the team is looking at me angrily. So that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. It's a great question. The pullback from discretionary spend is exactly right. I think I already rattled off a bunch of category drops that we are seeing year-on-year. And so that's certainly factual, and we do expect it to continue. Nobody knows when the trough of consumer demand has hit, but I don't feel like people are running out and buying couches all of February or January. But the demand for the program, I think, dropped a juicy stats in the opening part of my letter. We see about $1 billion of demand every week and I think that's not the same thing as well, great, why don't you guys take it because each one of these loans or each one of these applications has to be underwritten for \u2013 through the lens of what's responsible for us to take a risk on and what's responsible, frankly, for this person to borrow. So increasing consumer demand is certainly there. I think if we were careless, we could probably grow GMV to astronomical numbers quite quickly, but that is most certainly not what we're going to do. We are unique in a sense that we don't charge late fees. We do not profit from delinquencies. We did not celebrate late fee increases. And I'm glad there's some pressure downwards in that particular part of the world recently. So hopefully, the playing field is getting a little bit more level. But the demand is a good thing to have. I think we are now big enough where the overall consumer sentiment makes a deference to our business a little bit more than it used to. We're still growing 3 times the U.S. e-commerce rate. But as people walk away from buying more TVs, for example, it will have consequences. And so long as we are responsible lenders, we will feel a little bit of that. That's exactly right. And actually, Michael, I'm stealing his line in this one, but he loves to remind everybody that our loans are ranked in profit \u2013 correlation between profitability of our loans and the internal credit score or FICO score, if you will, more or less, are tightly correlated. In other words, the highest credit quality loans are also most profitable for us. We are not using \u2013 pardon the craft statement, poor people to subsidize great deals or rich people who are actually attributing the cost and profitability quite directly, which means that any time we need to or we decide to improve the profitability of the book, we end up taking slightly less risk at the very bottom. The overall demand for the product is still very strong. We're not seeing any \u2013 I've had enough BNPL during the pandemic back to my, I'm not sure which credit card we\u2019ll step on here. But not seeing burnout. If anything, on the margin, I feel like there's demand for more flexibility. I think the one thing that we're probably seeing \u2013 this is a little bit more anecdotal, so take it with a little bit of grain of salt, but any experiments during Debit+, we looked at sensitivity and consumer demand for longer terms. And obviously, people always want longer terms because just a little bit less cash flow hit on a monthly basis. But as the overall economic environment softened and consumer pulled back, it seems that at least part of the full pullback is actually cash flow dependent versus kind of a general decluttering trend, which is also by the way happening. Should have just quoted the transaction growth. I think that's the single highest growing metric actually in this quarter. That is a great question and something that is extremely top of mind for me. So I spent a lot of my time staring at reengagement stats, which is why you see it in my top three priority, both in my letter and certainly communications to the company. So the good news there \u2013 so first of all you're exactly right. If you tell someone, sorry, no loan for you and it's the first transaction that is not agreed, first impression and we will have to work harder to get the consumer back. Perhaps even worse, you can imagine a, I've been a loyal customer for a very long time, and now he can no longer serve me. So we invest a tremendous amount of resources to both the communication of the clients and also trying to make sure that we can bring folks back where appropriate. And part of why we know so well that the rate sensitivity is not actually a major problem for our consumer, certainly at the bottom part of the credit funnel is because we tested tremendous amount of those communications and just various forms of reengaging the consumer in our own services where we have total control where, of course, we are able to raise prices and ask for significantly higher down payments and optimize the overall experience instead of saying no, we can say, yes. The long and short of it is the results are good. Probably not worth getting into without a whiteboard. But perhaps when we see each other in person, I'll show you. We'll probably have to publish a charge for everybody to see, but we've tested what happens when we re-contact the consumer that we have declined. And what do they do when we tell them, hey, you're now approved or when we tell them here's a different form of transaction that we can approve you for. And they're very encouraging in the sense that consumers, especially those that have used Affirm before, are not particularly hurt or offended by the decline because we think we do a pretty good job explaining what happened and are quite willing to come back and reapply. So I'm, on the margin, confident we'll be able to continue engaging those consumers, and you'll see us actually invest quite a lot in products that enable that reengagement. That's a huge push within the product road map in the next couple of quarters, really, but it is very much top of mind and not something that we think is just going to be available to us and take it for granted. So it's an area of extreme focus for me. Yes. This is, if I have some egg in my face to clean off still, but this is the one. I saw myself a bit of a payments expert going back 30 years, and I think I still am, but I completely forgot the part where Visa and Mastercard, whenever they change rates where any network rule changes, they always operated in the six months schedule with a six months notice, and then there\u2019s a six months implementation window. And late summer we decided this is what\u2019s going to have to happen, and it in fact takes six months. And the way you do this right, is you structure these into the contracts, you make sure that these contracts stipulate both what happens when the rates go open, when the rates go down you make sure that, what the transition periods look like, et cetera. And this is, again somewhat embarrassingly our first effort of that kind. This is the lesson that we\u2019ve all now learned here. Certainly I am first in the line of the lesson learning, so I think you should not expect us to have to have another one of these apologizing sessions where we say, yes, we were going to change prices, but we took a lot longer than we thought. So, we\u2019ve now figured out or we\u2019ve learned how to price in the right amount of time. First of all, merchant count as a little bit of vanity network at our scale. I think Michael has a few promises in the letter. We\u2019re going to publish a slightly different metric to make sure it just shows kind of a true state of penetration. Huge merchants \u201cis a very countable set\u201d, and we are very well penetrated there, as I\u2019m sure all of you know. Mid-sized merchants are important because these are kind of leaps and bounds of volume that we\u2019re picking up, and that\u2019s where majority of our, if you will, hand-to-hand sales combat takes place these days and probably has been in the last few years. And so those are important. Little merchants are a little bit different. They sometimes become inactive, especially at the really small scale, become inactive over a course of a quarter. The true count of installed merchants or activated, but not necessarily active is significantly larger than a number we published and be easy to sort of have a even more inflated vanity metric here. But we\u2019re trying to be transparent here. So the growth of merchant base is kind of a set of weights for the weighted average total of GMV. Obviously GMV growth is what we are entirely focused on. Yes. Let, to be honest, I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head, whether it declined or, oh, yes, I guess it\u2019s slightly down quarter-on-quarter on the percentage basis. It is super important to us. So for the points of doubt, that is a thing that I care tremendously about. There\u2019s a little bit of equivalence between transactions that happen in our partner apps, for example, as we grow within Shopify that, or imagine that you can service those transactions both inside the Shopify app and in our own app. And we always route the consumer towards the most likely place of repayment because again, job number one, job number zero is making sure that credit metrics remain excellent. But the overall reengagement within the network is what we care about the most and our app and our site and our user extension and a bunch of other things. And most importantly, to me, at least right now, the card is where we are investing a huge percentage of our engineering cycles. The opposite required companion to the card in fact, the functionality is in the app. You\u2019re borrowing money in the app, you\u2019re not ever borrowing money than the card itself. And that is where we think a lot more of this for engagement will take place. There\u2019s some really cool experiments taking place there. I\u2019m staring at a spreadsheet titled Max\u2019s Top 20, which has 35 elements in it right now, which all the projects that we put in the motion over Christmas break with our Head of Consumer Products and we\u2019re shipping a couple of those every week now. So, I\u2019m very happy with the velocity of the experiments we\u2019re doing there. Yes. So the short answer is, when we talk about some of the speed of, for example, taking pricing, we would have a lot more of the impact in this year\u2019s guidance had we acted earlier and especially true given the size of the balance sheet that we\u2019re sitting on right now. So, we feel like there\u2019s a lot of very long, very big initiatives to improve the margin, and that is up in the revenue less transaction cost line item, much more so than in an OpEx. We feel like there\u2019s a lot of very big and structural improvements that we\u2019re going to be able to make, but they don\u2019t really show up in the vertical periods in Q3 and Q4 just given the timing of so many of, the flow-throughs for any moments on the balance sheet, for example. And so that\u2019s where the focus is. The effort is reflected in our guidance, but you\u2019re not going to see the full benefit of all of the efforts until the quarters play out in the back half of the calendar year. No material change. I think we\u2019re thankfully staring down what looks like a more flat rate curve, which I think is allowing us to focus our efforts on making sure we create profitable units at the kind of peak rate curve environment. But further stress above that would continue to have the same reaction in our framework."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Yes, that's a great question. We continue to believe that the long-term range of the revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV should be in the 3% to 4% range. I think what \u2013 you have a couple of factors going on in Q2 with respect to the timing of how we earn the revenue and how we recognize the expense that distorts it. And given the \u2013 that what we think is a one-time step-up in loans that are held for investment through our warehouse financing growth, we think that obviously will weigh down the full year number, but still allow us to end up in the 3% to 4%. And the reason for that is, as we've talked about before, the business is really a mix of split pay, paying for volume, which has margins that are much lower, and very profitable longer-term monthly installment and the two mix in a way where we can pretty reliably predict that 3% to 4%. Additionally, I'd point out that we feel really good about the quality of the assets that we originated this quarter. And as I say, the economic content there is really good. That hasn't been a primary driver. Most of what you're seeing is, again, how those yields flow through the P&L. Yes. We've not given any update to the framework that we laid out last year. I think that we would probably say we're in the midst of one of the biggest kind of moments of volatility from a macro sense. So, not sure that we would hold ourselves to the framework that we outlined a year and a half ago in this very moment. But I think part of the reason we laid out our profitability commitment to the end of the year was a reflection of the fact that we were wanting to get ahead of that from a framework standpoint. I think it's important to note that our direct-to-consumer channel, where we have complete control, is probably the best insight into where like the structural economics are here. And that's our most profitable product and channel. We have a very efficient way to engage and monetize that engagement in our app. And I think Max's opening remarks pointed out that one of the ways we're getting to our goals is by driving that engagement back to our own services where we can very profitably engage consumers and we're in full control of that experience. Yes. Just real quick. In our Q, you\u2019ll see we are breaking down the concentration that you see for Amazon. And I think we are \u2013 we have a meaningful exposure there. We are a little over 20% of our GMV. That is still underpenetrated versus Amazon\u2019s share of e-commerce. So, we still feel like we have a lot of room to grow there. And nothing happened to our business on to Max\u2019s earlier point, on the day the contract terms turned over. Sorry. Is your question why are we able to... Okay. Yes. I think we \u2013 the guidance for the back half of the year, transaction cost does reflect continued some volatile macroeconomic conditions, including and especially the capital markets where we would continue to expect there to be a lot of pressure on the yields that we need to generate for our capital partners. I think that\u2019s reflected in the guide. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s happening to us. The thing that we\u2019re doing about it is the pricing initiatives that Max alluded to. I think we\u2019d feel better about the world, have that already been in the ground and reflected in the mix of GMV that we\u2019re originating. And so we do expect that continue to be a source of pressure on us in the near-term. Yes. So the first question first. The markets are healing. I think that the New Year did an awful lot for the debt capital markets broadly. And you\u2019re seeing the ABS market open up. You\u2019re seeing much more constructive conversations with forward flow partners. Max and I spent a lot of time over the past couple of weeks meeting with couple of partners of all stripes. And the tone is just markedly better than where it was as the volatility appeared to be reducing, and the New Year really did help. So, we feel much better today, and yet we are still very much humbled around just how difficult it is to execute and how volatile and uncertainty remains. You saw the whipsaw this week in around the Fed meeting. And I think that kind of volatility is something we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re prepared to and comfortable at navigating, but it does reflecting us being very thoughtful and careful about how we run the business. With respect to your second question, absolutely, we will stay below 10%. We think this is near the high watermark for where that number should be. We think that the seasonality of our GMV, specifically the holiday shopping season late in the quarter and then, of course, in the quarter itself, causes an increase, a pretty big step-up in total platform portfolio that we don\u2019t think will continue to grow as quickly to the back half of the year, which means that our funding mix will probably be very stable through the back half of the fiscal year. So you wouldn\u2019t expect any meaningful increases in that equity capital required. And we would continue to feel confident in our ability to execute both securitization like we did earlier in January as well as net new capacity with forward flow partners. And so we feel good about our ability to do that right now as we sit here today, but nowhere near 10%. I think 5% is a really good number. I think it is obviously linked to delinquencies. And again, I apologize if this comes off as a admonished. It\u2019s really not. It\u2019s just a chance to learn about how this business works. We have a target \u2013 in my letter, I would really encourage everyone to look at it. It shows the delinquency trends at Affirm as compared to some of those traditional players whose measures, I think, some folks are wanting to apply to our business. We\u2019re the only player with the line on delinquencies pointing down, okay? And some players are not as high as others, but the directionality is very different. And that\u2019s because our asset turns over so fast that you\u2019re not building for losses for loans that you have. And it\u2019s somewhat of a cheeky statement, but we can\u2019t build allowance for loans that we don\u2019t own. And so we can\u2019t build ahead originations that haven\u2019t happened yet. And what you see here then isn\u2019t a judgment about how the back book will deteriorate in the macroeconomic environment. It is a reflection of the quality of loans that have originated recently given the velocity of the book. And so what you should interpret as the 5% is very much connected to that declining delinquency trend that you see. That\u2019s a reflection of extremely strong credit performance, much more so than anything else. Lastly, we included a chart in the supplement that I would encourage folks to look at, it just breaks out where the allowance bridge two from September to December and then, again, where the last 12 months have gone. And you\u2019ll see the allowance build is a reflection of both growth and assets, but also the actual charge-offs in the period. Yes, I think it really is the overall consumer demand, which shows up both in the aggregate GMV, but also the mix underneath that. And I think there\u2019s some good progress that we made. So for example, we were pretty happy to get our business with Peloton to actually to be ahead of where we thought it was going to be. There\u2019s a lot of strength of that program as they returned to some of the programs that we had from years before. And then there was a lot of real legitimate slowdown in the broad line merchants that we are very proud to partner with in some more of the durable goods categories. These are the larger considered purchases. And so I think we were surprised about that. And then frankly we continued to manage credit very tightly and we were probably and continue to be as Max alluded to, we\u2019re going to manage credit first, and that shows up on the positive side with really excellent credit performance, which ensures that we continue to access capital and our capital is not a constraint on the growth in our business, and yet it does create some short-term top line headwind. And remember, the Debit+ product is another one of these channels that we control entirely. So some of the profitability of the product is a function of that, and we feel really good about where that fits right now. Yes, it\u2019s two factors. There\u2019s interest rate increases and then there is credit. And I think we spent a lot of time on talking about why controlling credit is so important for the yield those investors get. And that is a point of pretty big differentiation when thinking about us versus some of the other alternatives that some of these forward flow partners could be buying. And as that differentiation grows, we know we\u2019ll get rewarded for it. And yet also we need \u2013 we do feel the need to increase the revenue content in the loans that we\u2019re selling in the form of higher APRs, for example. I think the \u2013 we\u2019re not giving specific guidance to the balance sheet or to the funding models through the back half of the year. But we do expect the mix that we saw in our second quarter to be pretty consistent with the mix that you would end the year at. So, I think it\u2019s safe starting point is to assume that we\u2019re flattish, which means we still have our largest funding channel is still going to be the forward flow market. That\u2019s where the most of the total platform portfolio will be sitting as a single channel. We did the securitization in the beginning of this quarter, which will allow us to grow that line item and yet that still is on the balance sheet with slightly more leverage than yet with the warehouses. So anyway, I would assume flat within \u2013 certainly within modeling errors is a good assumption, which means that our affordable partners are at the table and still dealing constructively and maintaining their level of commitment throughout the back half of the year. That\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s worse. So we\u2019ve contemplated that we would continue to have yield pressure with respect to our forward flow partners. We saw that in the pricing conversations that we\u2019ve had and been having. And while we\u2019re very confident about our ability to control the asset yields, as Max talked about it is the case that the rising rate environment has put the yield threshold higher for all of these programs. Yes. And again we don't talk enough about this, but we should. We're growing at somewhere between 2 and 3 times. We estimate the U.S. e-commerce growth rate to be, and that's despite posting 115% growth in GMV last year. And so I think it's easy to think about \u2013 thinking that the industry has slowed down, but you have to put into context the overall scale that we got to and how we kind of got there a little bit more quickly. We still feel like it's underpenetrated, and we'll get to the kind of numbers that we talked about. I think some of the quarter growth rate numbers are a reflection of the comps. And again, the growth rate last year was buoyed up by the launch of three major programs, all happening at the same time. And we're quite proud that we were able to do that, but that doesn't mean that some of the growth rates need a little bit wider aperture to get an understanding of what's really going on. The fact that transaction counts are up 50% year-on-year suggest that consumers are not at all being burned out by very high demand for. We are figuring out a way to profitably serve those transactions. And then there\u2019s just also some math that\u2019s really important when we are scaling programs like we are with the largest platforms and, e-commerce players and Amazon and Shopify as an example. All of that growth, all those transactions are obviously not starting, on our platform. And so a lot of growth is coming from there, which means that like, I\u2019m actually very impressed we\u2019ve been able to hold it as constant given, the rapid rise in growth in these partners. And so I think to Max\u2019s earlier point, that the health of the network is reflected in those engagement stats and the user stats and growth in transaction counts, and the fact that we\u2019re holding serve on the level of engagement through our properties today is a really encouraging sign given the growth that\u2019s happening away. As those growth rates attenuate, you\u2019re going to see our share pickup."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. Welcome to the Affirm Holdings First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Following the speakers remarks, we will open the lines for your questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nZane Keller: Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. Forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the company does not assume any obligation or intend to update them, except as required by law. In addition, today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings supplement slide deck, which is available on our Investor Relations website. Before turning the call over, we want to briefly note our shift to a quarterly shareholder letter instead of a lengthy press release and prepared remarks. We believe that this format will enable us to spend more time answering questions from the investment community. As such, we encourage to review the shareholder letter for commentary that we would typically include in our prepared remarks. In addition, we believe that the shareholder letter, when read in conjunction with our earnings supplement, will enhance our ability to communicate with the investment community. Both documents are available on our Investor Relations website. This change was also influenced by feedback that we received from investors. We hope you find the shareholder letter informative, and we welcome any feedback. Hosting today's call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us. Our results reinforce the confidence we have in our strategy and Affirm's ability to capitalize on our opportunities. Two years ago, that was time we were preparing for a journey as a public company. We're now completing our eighth quarter as a publicly traded company, and it seems really good time to compare our results for the 12 months ending September 30, 2022, versus the 12 months ending December 31, 2020, which was the last calendar year as a private company for us. Since then, with comparison, we've more than tripled active consumers. We quintupled transactions almost. We grew transactions per active consumer 1.5 times, per transaction frequency by 50%, and near tripled our trailing 12-month GMV. Both have doubled our revenue and almost tripled revenue less transaction costs growing at up to $732 million. All while, we've been in control of our credit results. Delinquencies and net charge-offs remain at or below pre-pandemic levels, very important to us. We remain focused on long term, while making sure to navigate the present macro volatility very possibly. We're continuing to obsess over risk and transaction costs to maintain a strong unit economics. We will shift features that improve network scale and profitability like we always have. We're going to manage our OpEx carefully while investing in our highest conviction product opportunities. We're building deep connections with consumers and merchants who need us now more than ever before. Both sides of our network can navigate economic uncertainty and we see this as an opportunity to solidify our position as a trusted and reliable partner. Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller: Thank you, Max. With that, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: I want to talk first about this path to profits in 2023. Obviously, you reiterated that, but nevertheless, you're looking for little bit lower GMV and associated performance on the top line. How are you thinking about like the evolution of that timing and what you need to do to make sure you get to breakeven or profitability in 2023?\nMichael Linford: James, thanks for the question. Yes, we are still very much on time and on pace to achieve the profitability goal that we outlined, which just to recap everybody, we talked about getting to profitability starting in the first day of our fiscal '24. We said on a sustainable basis, meaning that we'll intend to do it repeatedly most of the time and looking at adjusted operating income. And so for us, the challenge is some pretty simple math. We need our revenue less transaction costs to be greater than the adjusted operating expenses that we have below the transaction cost line. The key things for us then are making sure we're doing everything we can to maximize the unit economics in the business. And if you look at our back half of the year road map, we have a lot of focus on making sure we're doing all that we can and should do there as Max outlined in the letter. And we're going to be mindful about controlling our operating expenses. And to that, that means being very careful, in particular, on hiring, but also making sure that we're not having any pockets of waste in the business. As we continue to scale the business and make the right investments, we also don't want to have dollars waste in the system. If you look at our kind of guidance, the back half of the year and the adjusted operating expenses that are implied by that, we feel like we'll put this in a really fit shape so that we'd be exiting right where we want to be to achieve that goal for next year.\nJames Faucette: And then on -- a lot of places we could go but let's start with -- starting with delinquencies. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that you're still a bit below where you were pre-pandemic. However, directionally, you're starting to get pretty close to those levels now. And just wondering how you're thinking about like managing that, especially since I would think that there would be an increasing number of repeat customers in that 2023 versus pre-pandemic, which if they're repeat, you would think that they would tend to be better behaving in terms of at least delinquency, et cetera. So where should we think that you'll try to top those out at? How are you going to manage that? And what's the -- I guess, the prognosis for when you would do that and under what conditions?\nMax Levchin: I'll start and I think Michael can probably help quantify second half of the question. So just to set the stage, the most important thing to take away from us, we are not just managing credit outcomes, we set them. The whole point of these ultra short-term 4.6 months weighted average life of every loan, every transaction is underwritten. We have full control of transactions requiring down payment, or not, we control the amount of down payment, et cetera, cetera. So we have lots of levers we use to control risk. We've said about talked about this many, many times, but never gets old. And that gives us a lot of very nimble controls over the actual credit outcomes. So we set a number we want to hit. Obviously, every week, we get a stack full of new formation going back all the cohorts that are still active, and we adjust credit that we have been now managing it quite actively to make sure that we get to the numbers that we require. Because the back book runs off very quickly, we have a lot of control. This compares pretty favorably with the rest of the industry that does things like credit card consolidation loans or personal loans that go back years and there's nothing you can do about it. So that's just a really important thing to understand. And again, I apologize for -- to those who from this sounds like just an old repeat, but this really is how this business works. And the reason our numbers are strong as they are today, and you can see this in the letter, is not an accident. It's not as though the world hasn't changed. There's plenty of stress on the consumer in the lower income brackets, lower credit quality. We're just good at managing, and we do underwrite every transaction, and therefore, we have a lot of control. So that's sort of the backdrop. The counterpoint to this is the demand for BPL is increasing. We serve our consumers, we see demand in the application side of things. Generally speaking, people are turning -- not just going to look at credit cards, people are turning to more than they used to do that. I mean we're not done in the higher income brackets spending through the pandemic stimulus, but they're getting closer, probably sometime mid next year is when we'll see the exhaustion of those savings. But today, the lower income groups are already done and they're trying to turn to various forms of debt. We believe pretty firmly we have done the best alternative out there. We have 85% repeat transaction from existing consumers to prove that. And so you have enough demand, and we do have a lot. We have enough diversity of merchants where as folks shift out of Connected Fitness and finance our homewares you go for big box, more commodity purchase. We are there to help them with all those things. And so demand is still quite strong. If we have control, as we do all of our credit outcomes, we can manage to the number that we need at once. That's sort of how we're doing it. Michael can give you a little bit more data on exactly where we intend to run it. But again, this is the choice we have as opposed to a thing we have to contend with.\nMichael Linford: That's right. And it varies by product, and it varies by merchants that we're at. So I think your point is very well taken that we do see substantial improvements in credit quality as we see more repeat usage. And I'll note that we're still acquiring new users at a pretty good clip and thinking about the business is still feeling and we're not done with the acquisition side of the equation, certainly not on a gross basis. The additional disclosures that we've got now in the shareholder letter would really encourage folks to spend some time with them, both looking at the delinquency trends, which we now show 30, 60, 90 as well as we've got the net cohort ties, net charge-off curves for our monthly loans and then given you some trending that you can see on. And I think the biggest takeaway for all of those is that we are dialing in where these things are. It's going to be a week or a month that varies up or down, but we get to dial in where those losses, and that's such an important strategic piece of this business, that we can take that loss, then we can have confidence in how we think about the credit losses with respect to our capital partners, we have confidence in how it affects our P&L and allows us to confidently go approve to a very deep level. I think if you put us up against most of the people in the traditional financial institution world or most people who do unsecured consumer lending, our results are really good. And we feel like that is a real strength for us, and we're not going to treat it lightly. That's something we're going to continue to do, first and foremost, as it's an important aspect in everything that we do. While waiting, just for what it's worth, I'm not the only person who looks at credit at this company. I'm one of the very significant number of you does that. But when I look at our credit outcomes, I look at over tied data basically performance by vintage.\nMax Levchin: Strong plus one to Michael, please have a look at what we put out in the letter. We really wanted to communicate very clearly to our investors that this is the one piece of the business that matters to us, should matter for our investors, and we are in full control, and we look at these things on a over-debt basis as we think you should.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nMoshe Orenbuch: In the past couple of quarters, we've talked about the potential to change price to consumers. Does the fiscal '23 guide for revenue less transaction costs assume any pricing changes? And if not, what would it take to get you to start that process?\nMichael Linford: Excellent question. So the short answer is there's a number against across merchant, consumer pricing and the rest of our transaction cost line items that are not reflected in our guide. Those remain as upside and a little bit, if you will, so how we think about the guidance, we want to be really careful to put in the guidance things that we are certain about as opposed to things that we hope will deliver and help close the gap. And that's why we, for example, look at the current forward curve. We don't have a proprietary house view of rates. And we try to look at the current shift and live features of the product. And so there is some aspect of higher APR, but the majority of the opportunity for higher APRs to consumers is not reflected in the guide as is the opportunity we have on the merchant side from a pricing perspective.\nMoshe Orenbuch: And as a follow-up, given the funding stresses that you and others in the industry have seen this quarter, could you, and maybe Michael, talk a little bit about what your plans are, obviously, given going into a quarter where you're going to generate a lot of interest-bearing loans? Do you have an outlet for them? And you mentioned in some of the text here about the potential for lower gain on sale. Could you maybe put some numbers around that, how much lower? And how should we think about it?\nMichael Linford: Yes. The thing we're pointing out in the letter is that we think, we'll be slightly above the 5% equity capital required, which as you know, we've been running substantially lower than that over the past several quarters. That does reflect what we think will be a higher usage of balance sheet, in particular, where health financing into this quarter. So let me answer the broader question for assuming all the way out. We have a lot of conviction and confidence in our ability to fund the business. I don't think we're worried about that at all. The question for us is going to be the shape of the P&L as it goes through the various funding models that we have. And it is the case that we will have slightly more on balance sheet, which means that as you see in the Q2 guide for that revenue less transaction costs, you have two factors that are really affecting that number in the quarter and the reason for the back half of the year acceleration. They are the late in the quarter origination, late November into December origination of interest-bearing loans that end up on the balance sheet. That creates a lot of vertical pressure, meaning the period Q2 results will be depressed on a percentage of GMV. When you look out to the back half of the year, we're implying acceleration a pretty meaningful one in revenue less transaction cost. That is an assumption of a material change in the economics of the business that simply the stuff that we'll originate in Q2 flowing through the P&L in the back half of the year. The opportunities in that again that you alluded to at the very top, those have actually just be on top of or in addition to the acceleration that we're currently going to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRamsey El-Assal: I was wondering on the changes to guidance, if you could disaggregate the impact from Peloton, I think that you called out in the shareholder letter, versus other factors?\nMichael Linford: Yes. So I think there's two drivers, and then there's some math you can do. The biggest drivers are Peloton, both and most acutely in our second quarter. So to give you some context, in our second quarter, we talk about a GMV growth rate that would be 40% instead of the guided to 31% in the second quarter. And we'd estimate that on a revenue basis, we would be up 29% in the second quarter instead of 16%. Obviously, that's a very material headwind with respect to the top line measures in the business. Back half of the year, that starts to attenuate quite a bit. But in the back half of the year, we are modeling the impact of the movement in rates. And we talked a lot about there being roughly 30 basis points of headwind, of which we're mitigating roughly half of that in our guidance in terms of the RLTC take rate. And so those are the 2 biggest drivers. It's important to talk about the cause -- those are the effects and the root causes. But one of the important things as we were just talking about is as we use the balance sheet a little bit more in Q2, you're going to, again, change the shape a little bit of that margin and that will continue on throughout the course of the year. But we think it's more of a onetime change in terms of the warehouse usage that we'll see next quarter, and we'll run the business at that level for the next couple of quarters, which will result in more revenue that we'll earn later for originations, and that trend will show up as you'd expect.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And one follow-up for me. You also mentioned in the shareholder letter that your sensitivity to additional interest rate increases has decreased since you initially gave us a look at that in February. What are the drivers there? What is helping that number come down?\nMichael Linford: Honestly, I think it's as much anything actually observing the impact that our counterparties are flowing through rates. When we gave that initial framework back in February of this year, we were taking into account a lot of the potential first and second order effects. And obviously, we were doing it -- we gave you a framework to think about it as every 100 basis points, there's a second or third order effect, too, because the set of the curve begins to affect decisions and I think it's more just as we've observed and seen the impact, we're just updating the range for everybody.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nMike Ng: I just have two. First, Max, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on new product development for things like brand-sponsored promotions and whether or not the CFPB report and things like that change the product road map strategy at all. And then second for Michael. I was just wondering if you could talk about what GMV may have looked like, excluding Amazon. And I hear you loud and clear on the RLTC and AOI margin path for the rest of the year. As we go into the back half, is that improvement in margin really driven by, I guess, like gross take rates on interest income and then servicing income because of that late fiscal second quarter originations?\nMax Levchin: So probably the most important thing to respond to, the CFPB point. I don't know if you had a chance to read it. From my point of view, it's a great document describing the state of the industry. I think they did a pretty thorough job both interviewing and summarizing what the industry is doing. Gratifying to have my S1 letter quoted in the CFPB report, that was an interesting highlight. No, I don't think our road map has changed at all. In fact, if you look in many ways, the letter essentially highlights that there's lots of companies in the BNPL space. And there's one that's very different. And they didn't go as far as naming us, but we're the only ones who doesn't charge late fees, doesn't have a sort of other shenanigans that regulators really dislike. And so I feel pretty great about what I said there. Probably the most interesting sort of material thing in their note is coming in the industry essentially to help consumers build their credit history and credit scores through the NPL loans. And we've been working pretty closely with the accredited reporting agencies and various other participants in the industry to help further that along. And so we'll definitely continue listening to what the regulators have to say in the matter and that our own ideas, et cetera. But generally speaking, I felt that it was a very positive thing for the industry and certainly for a firm. Our road map is not impacted. Brand-sponsored promotions are, I would say, you'll see more of them going forward. It has two components to it. One is the build-out of the -- what takes engineering is the product has to be actually fully built and we are making pretty great progress there. I don't quite have all the building littles that I want, but it's a thing that's live in a bunch of places. And then it becomes a matter of sales where you actually have to bring it to merchants and manufacturers and brands. And so we're getting on that. Like everything else we do, these things will take time to build. I think we'll, at some point, break them out to sell off just how cool they are and how margin-rich they become, but that's probably a conversation for another time. I feel like I may answer the question. Was there more to it? Yes. No. Thank you. I think I covered it. I don't have to say more.\nMichael Linford: And then in terms of the kind of back half of the year. And I understand the question correctly, you're talking about that LTC as a percentage of GMV, improving pretty meaningfully in the back half of the year. It's really just really simple math. As you put more interest-bearing loans on the balance sheet, you defer or you earn the revenue as those interest payments are made throughout the course of the loan. So if you take a 12-month loan that's originated on in December, for example, most of that income happened in the back half of the year. What's important, though, is the provision for credit losses for those loans will happen upfront. And so that means as you get less revenue, less transaction costs in the period, even though those loans are very good and profitable for us throughout the year. But then more broadly, I think it's just really important to remember how early we are with these large partners and with the program overall. We talked about some mitigants earlier that are things that we're working on right now, but don't yet have reflected in the forecast. That's on top of the very long list of projects that we have that focus on the unit economics, as Max talked about in the letter. And that's the ordinary course of business. There's something special about that, but something that we would and will continue to do regardless. And those can range from settle optimizations that we have on the process play page, tweaks that we can make to how our app search feature work to really drive better revenue take in the period and the list goes on. And those optimizations and those opportunities represent for us a lot of the upside here. But the primary driver in the guidance is the flow-through of the larger balance sheet in experience.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with True Securities. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Julian on for Andrew. Just want to talk -- go back to the credit side. I know you just mentioned that the provisioning would kind of, I guess, be more front half-weighted and then we'll see kind of it come down in the back half. Is that the right way to think about that?\nMichael Linford: Yes. So we always provision at the time of purchase. Well, when we own it, strictly speaking. And so that's always the case. The difference is as we -- on the margin, we'll have less marginal growth dollars being sold versus place on the balance sheet, you'll just -- you'll actually carry the provision versus getting the gain on sale and no provision. And so like the income profile just changes a little bit as you think about those loans being on the balance sheet versus off.\nUnidentified Analyst: And if I can just get one more in. Can you kind of quantify maybe the non-Amazon growth versus Amazon growth embedded in GMV this quarter? And then also, it seems like it's a pretty good 2Q guide, all things considered. So just kind of maybe quantify that a little bit.\nMichael Linford: We can't quantify. We're not disclosing GMV by partner here. What I would point you to is we do disclose the near 500% or over 500% growth in the general merchandise category that does pick up a number of merchants, including Amazon, Walmart and Target. Those are big, all of which had growth and strong growth, but we're not breaking out GMV by part.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nReggie Smith: You have a slide in your presentation that shows 30-day delinquencies. And I guess wanted some help kind of interpreting the data. So when I look at kind of pre-pandemic, it appears that DQs kind of declined as the year progresses. But when I look at '22, it increased as the year progressed. And so what conclusion should we draw from this charge? Should we expect things to kind of follow the arc of pre-pandemic? Is that what you're suggesting or our DQ is going to continue to kind of increase? And I have a follow-up.\nMichael Linford: Yes. So there is a seasonal pattern to credit performance in our experience that relates to both the purchasing patterns consumers have as well as certain key cash flow milestones like, for example, the tax refund time lines. What you saw during the pandemic was pretty a big surge of available monetary supply and liquidity given to consumers, which really did affect pretty substantially what was in the ordinary pattern that you'd expect to see. And so as we're kind of shedding all of that excess consumer liquidity, I think you're going to see a more normal pattern for consumer credit trends in terms of the seasonality. And that's why we're referencing back to the pre-pandemic period. And if you see on Page 10 of our letter, you'll see us sitting around on top of the FY '20 pre-pandemic trends, which we feel like is, again, right where we'd like the business to be.\nReggie Smith: There's another slide. I think you guys hinted at the potential of raising kind of merchant fees. Obviously, interest rates have gone up a lot this year, but you've held your zero interest take rates relatively constant. Can you talk about, I guess, the process for raising those? Is it kind of like a bolt-on that goes out? Do you have a sense that there may be some merchant pushback? And everybody obviously recognizes that rates are higher, but how -- mechanically like how would that actually play out? And again, sensitivity, how sensitive do you think merchants are to higher zero interest rates?\nMax Levchin: So you're right. We have not, generally speaking, moved prices on either consumers or merchants to date. I think everyone -- but everyone understands that our largest supplier increased their price threefold, as Michael put it the other day. And at some point, one does pass the cost on to their customers. The process with merchants is a little bit different based on the type of the partnership. So obviously, some of our largest merchant GMV segments come from platform partnerships like Shopify. Others are individual platform like Editis, G Walmart and Amazon. And then there's a whole list of directly any rigs that are either on the platform or not, but we have a direct relationship. There's no third-party platform involved. Those are probably the buckets. In the case of fully directly integrated folks, it's a notification that there's different contractual time lines that we've committed to, to giving them notice change of price. Obviously, they have some ways of reacting, for example, like a virus in some cases, in other cases, they can try to negotiate, et cetera, in the platform and the really large quantity platform merchants. Obviously, it's a little bit more of a conversation because they are responsible for a whole host of underlying merchants that have -- and have other financial relationships with those folks. So a lot of times, it depends a little bit on their schedule of raising their own prices, which they may or may not be thinking about. And so the merchant side of the equation is a little bit slower moving. The consumer side, we obviously have quite a lot more control because obviously, every transaction is underwritten and the price and it does change based on credit quality and what we're seeing, et cetera. And we have to follow their lending laws, so we can't change on one person or the other. So there's a fair amount of consideration there. All that said, we've done this before. At the very beginning of the pandemic, we went to our merchants and told them that we have no idea what's going to happen next, but we expect our risk to go up very substantially. And therefore, we will price it in with them. At that time, I think exactly zero merchants fired us or did anything but say, we get it, we're going to work with you because it's important for us to continue selling. So feel pretty strongly about our ability to command the price for our products and include the fluctuations that we see in our supply. But it's not an instant switch, but it's something that we've done before. I feel very confident we're able to execute on if we should decide to do so.\nMichael Linford: And I would say that the tone from a lot of merchants right now, there's two pieces that are tugging around this conversation. One is a lot are focused on margin. And all of our merchant partners, and clearly, anything that's perceived as an additional cost is under a lot of scrutiny. On the other hand, I think a lot of merchants are looking at their own outlook, the holiday season and to early part of next year and are looking for ways they can get back some of that growth in volume they had before. Those two things always net out to a good deal that allows us to the economist we need and drive the volume that we need to them. But it is unconstrained. Merchants do have real margin constraints services right now.\nReggie Smith: Got it. Can I sneak one more in real quick?\nMichael Linford: Yes. Go ahead.\nReggie Smith: So obviously, you guys report your reserve rate and it was down sequentially. Thinking about like how am I going to explain that to investors and the things that come to my mind are you've got more repeat customers, you got a better view of the customer. And then also your average life of your portfolio was only 9 months now. Is there anything else I'm missing there? Or what else can we add to maybe address concerns about a declining reserve rate?\nMichael Linford: Yes. Again, I would -- I'd start with, first, just how we think about the reserve. I think some financial institutions have a team of economists who are thinking about the state of the consumer and trying to make a forecast with their reserves. If we did that by the time we got the answers from the every tower, the loans would have paid back. And so instead what we do is we look at the actual performance of the loans, and we look at the [IPAC] score, the credit score that we give loans when they\u2019re originated, and use those 2 things to indicate how those loans will perform. And then we look at whether or not those predictions of performance are holding up. And that's very math-driven. We're not sitting here with a lot of judgment up and down or prognostication about future trends and deterioration in credit. It's very math and model driven. And if you look at, for example, again on Slide 11, our Page 11 of the letter, [indiscernible] for loan performance, you see pretty material reduction in the credit losses that we have for our pay-for-product. While it does turn over very fast, it isn't the biggest part of our allowance, it is all on the balance sheet and will continue to be and therefore has, as you improve the quality of losses in that product, you're obviously going to see less allowance needed for it.  And similarly, I think a lot of the stress that we talked about starting to see in the end of our last fiscal year, the mitigates that we took resulted in us originating a higher quality asset going into this quarter and into the back half of this year. And that higher-quality asset would suggest it has a lower loss content. It's a good thing. It's not that -- it's not a bad thing. It's a very good thing that we estimate less losses in the loans that we're originating.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with D.A. Davidson.\nChris Brendler: I'll start with another 1 on the credit side. Can you quantify at all sort of -- obviously, it's a more difficult environment across a number of issues. But for consumer credit and sort of the tightening you've done, the trends are really impressive just given all the concerns we hear about the consumer. But how much of an impact does that had on your growth forecast maybe for this year? I don't think you really changed your guidance that much on GMV. So is that a factor? Or is there enough demand that, that's offsetting the tighter product conditions?\nMichael Linford: There's definitely an impact of credit on our volume. It's just nowhere near as substantial as I think some folks might think. The far bigger impact in the update in our guidance is the impact that we saw from Peloton. When you take a business that has a lot of headwind like that, we thought we were being pretty conservative in our outlook for that business this year. And I think that it's underperformed even where we had set that bar. And that's the biggest driver of the reduction in the guidance for the year. We haven't given a way to quantify it, but we don't take that, for example, the movement in the guidance is because we sequentially have tightened our view on credit.\nChris Brendler: Okay. Great. Super helpful. A follow-up on the areas of demand and on their side, competition. I have to believe, I think we've really heard some competitors are struggling a lot more than a firm is. So are you seeing any benefits yet as you talk to merchants of the froth coming off in an improved competitive environment? And I'd love to hear sort of like your, I guess, take your temperature on your ability or sort of the thinking as you talk to merchants, is that going to be a conversation that you've already started? Or is that still one to come?\nMax Levchin: I'm going to try really hard not to sound glib and spike the football and take victory laps, et cetera, the short answer is yes. I've been saying this for a long time that we're about to quote about tide coming out and noticing that some people are swimming without trunks on. I wouldn't exactly classify our state of affairs as struggling, but I do believe some of our competitors are. And it is accretive to us. We have merchants coming in and saying, \"Hey, would you guys consider side-by-side with a competitor?\" And where in the past, we would come in and ask them will they consider it, and they'd say they were fine, the approvals are good, and now approvals are not. And ours are still doing quite well. So that just makes it that much easier to take share. Sometimes side by side, sometimes and probably could rattle off into brands that are turning us on either instead of or alongside some of our esteemed competitors because they feel they the need to continue driving their top line and the competition no longer can approve as well as they used to. So yes, it's been quite helpful to us, so long as we continue hitting our numbers on credit, which we absolutely tend to do, and keep approvals high, which should give you a sense that all these quarters I've been promising that the curve is really steep. We need to move our GMV just a little bit to reduce our prospective losses by a lot. It seems to be working out the way we promised it. So long as it keeps going, we'll continue taking share.\nChris Brendler: Awesome. And congrats on a tough environment. And also thanks for all the disclosures on the credit. It's really helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: I just wanted to follow up on -- considering your guidance, you've tightened underwriting, growth is slow to pay, but obviously a lot due to Peloton. When you look at 2023, are you assuming what the base case is for unemployment and whether it's slowing in spending? Or are you starting to put in place additional measures to assume that unemployment is going to spike or there's going to be something worse than what we expect beyond what most economists have in their forecast or the forward curve indicates? Is there something there that you're anticipating and managing for?\nMax Levchin: I'll start on the credit side, and Michael probably has comments on the rate side of things. So we are anticipating some degree of worsening on the credit side of things. That said, we really concern ourselves with the next 4.5 months of volume. That's just really, really important to mitigate. Our ability to manage credit to the numbers that we choose is a consequence of our ability to underwrite and get the data sources that we need and make it -- do it very quickly. But probably the single most important structural part of how we're different from everyone else in the market is we have very short-term product. We're not granting lines, which means that a credit decision we made today, even if it's erroneous, will be the last time we made that mistake. And we're able to deal with a lot more demand that we choose to lend. And so as consumers feel more stretched, they come to us more often. That does not change that we apply the same level of diligence and care to every loan that we underwrite. And so we are primarily focusing on making sure that our data sources are fresh, that our models react correctly to the change in consumer behavior, which we have absolutely seen, given just over the last 5, 6 years of operating, including the last 6 months of the current macroeconomic volatility. So all of that is fed into how we underwrite, but our ability to weather the whatever incoming storm might be headed our way is deeply rooted in the fact that we make very, very short-term, relatively speaking, credit decisions. And we have no shortage of demand for our product. I'll pause there. I just want to had another point to make, but Michael has a few.\nMichael Linford: No, just -- look, the way we approach it is always to take the current consensus, to take the forward curve or a rate assumption, we don't try to grow. And there's a number of scenarios that could play out very differently. As you point out, we could enter into a recession and have more employment. Of course, that would probably have come with less pressure on rates than we're probably currently modeling. And the flip side is the rate probably could get worse and employment could continue to be very robust. And I think we're trying to just be middle of the road here and be very close around when we're assuming that the current macro consensus is where the business is -- what will play out, understanding that this forecast are always wrong, but we have to make sure of something. And so just like we did when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year, we're going to peg it to the rate curve. And as rates move, you should expect that to impact our businesses with the framework that we given in.\nKevin Barker: That's really helpful. And then I appreciate the short duration of the product. Obviously, very\u2026\nMax Levchin: One last thing -- sorry, on that point, the point that I was going to make I blanked on. So 1 of the other things that we have because of the Adaptive Checkout, which we had the presence of wanting to launch about a year ago, the menu of terms the consumer will see is programmatically determined by us. And so we have enormous amount of control over this, 4.6% average. The product isn't just in of itself short, we also get to decide whether a particular credit quality applicant sees the longest or longer durations versus the shorter ones. And so 1 of the things that you could say we're preparing to do, although we don't have to act on it right now, if we felt that the unemployment is about to spike or starting to go up really rapidly, we would necessarily pull in terms and make the 4.6% average go down just to make sure there are fewer opportunities for our borrowers to default. So that's another level of control that we have. And that typically corresponds very nicely just from research and past lives with the shift from luxury buying to general merchandise purchasing. People don't need to borrow quite as much, and therefore, shorter terms make more sense for the cash flow. So this actually should not have the real impact on our take rate on the consumer side but will reduce our risk.\nKevin Barker: Sorry, Max. Go ahead. Yes, I was just saying there's certainly quite a bit of advantage to having rapid velocity on your lending and being able to shift. When you think about the RTLC guide for the back half of the year implying quite a bit of improvement, do you feel like you could continue to hit that if things get worse? I mean, obviously, maybe there's a little bit of slowing growth and tightening underwriting, but you're going to focus more on profitability? Or does that get pushed out a little further, but still remains something that you can see in the future, at least in the near term, on hitting some of those guidance?\nMax Levchin: I've attempted to make some sort of read my lips joke, but I will not. We will hit profitability on schedule. We are not pushing off profitability. The product we're focusing on are about creating more RLTC, creating -- mitigating some of the rate volatility. But ultimately, we feel very good about our schedule. We are not suffering from any need to postpone on our deed with destiny. I think I'm not supposed to say that, but I like the alliteration.\nMichael Linford: And then the last thing is we take our guidance really seriously, we grow our thought onto it. And if our guidance moves because we think something has changed, and I think what you saw on the GMV outlook here, as we talked about, a pretty big impact of Peloton. And then obviously, we're digesting a pretty big headwind in rate. There are certainly macro conditions that could make that goal and objective not come through, but we feel very confident as we sit here today.\nMax Levchin: Act of God are not included in our guidance.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Just want to ask on 2 popular questions we get. Just on approval rates, it sounds like they stayed high, but maybe they were down a little bit in the quarter. Maybe you can just clarify that and then the outlook on approval rates, what do you expect?\nMax Levchin: The approval rate has actually stayed relatively flat throughout the quarter. In fact, they basically stayed flat for the last 9 months, if memory serves, with a slight uptick in the interim -- in the 3 months in between. The first 3 and the last 3, we actually increased the approval rate a little bit. And so maybe this month -- this quarter, it went down a tiny bit. But this is sort of back to the products that we offer consumers. So we have an enormous amount of control over the actual shape of the risk we're going to take on. We, generally speaking, have a way of finding a way to say yes to a consumer. If somebody comes in and says, \"Hey, I want to borrow x $100 over y months or weeks,\" in some situations, the answer is, no, that's not going to happen because we just don't think you can carry this much cash flow burden on a monthly basis. However, we're very happy to help you with a lower monthly number if you're willing to prepay the delta basically. And that have a dozen other levers that allow us to shape the risk we take and make sure we need the consumers where they are without adding unnecessary burden to our provision. So we have been certainly very active in using those levers. We do this at the merchant by merchant level, sometimes SKU by SKU level because we can infer which products are getting prioritized how and repayments and things like that. But to date, we have not needed to slam the brakes on approvals. And again, and I said it before, credit is job number one. We will always prioritize managing to numbers that we feel we must hit to ensure capital partners see us as the best yield, most predictable yield generator for them. But that does not need for us that we have to turn people away at the door. It does mean that some people will have a slightly larger down payment request. In some cases, we will ask for more information. In some cases, this means that we need to see their cash flow data, which is somewhat burdensome, but it's better than being told no. And so we have a lot of confidence in our ability to maintain rates. And while we don't generally speak and contractually agree to guaranteed approvals with our merchants, the reason they keep us hired, if you will, and the reason they like to hire us over our competitors, because we always deliver on approval rates, first and foremost, and that helps them drive their top line and sales that wouldn't have happened without Affirm.\nBryan Keane: Got it. No, that's helpful. And then maybe just an update, Max, on the Debit+ product and the rollout there.\nMax Levchin: Thank you for asking. I was wondering if somebody might remember. So actually trying not to be glib. So 1 of the things that I could do a year ago as the Product in Chief and don't feel like I can now is roll out a product with economics that I don't feel are fundamentally accretive to the business. So sometimes I think in the beginning of last quarter or right around that time, we've basically taken the week list that we generated and given a pretty meaningful number of people sort of tens of thousands of active cards type level cards to observe the usage. As with every new credit product, you end up with economics you don't particularly like. And we spent the last 3 months just really chiseling away at all the various fraud vectors and loss possibilities and a whole bunch of new kind of losses that happen in debit loss. There's obviously pre-transaction, which is very similar to -- for many of the product that we have inside the SuperApp. There's the post one, which is where you swipe and then you choose to split, how these are a 24-hour limbo where the transaction might turn into pay now or could become pay later. And then there's also inhibition funds, which is the pay now can become a default and write-off.  So there's a bunch of new vectors, both intentional, unintentional losses, spent the last 3 months just really making sure that we feel good about the unit economics of this product. We're almost there. I feel very good about it. And probably January 1 is kind of a realistic time line when we're going to start pushing this forward. Again, the product that is brand new, we're not going to, given today's reality of the question about our term profitability, nothing will be more frustrating than saying everything is awesome, we're hitting every number, except debit loss turn out to be loss here than I thought. So sorry about that profitability is postponed. That will not happen. That said, I feel quite good about where the profitability of that product is today. I'll feel a lot better in January we have a whole bunch more planned. And that's when we expect to start actually delivering these cards. And you will know this pretty easily right now to get to Debit+, you have to either be in the selected group or we promote it or you kind of have to know your way. I mean you can go on if you want it, but it's a little bit of work. The day you see your Affirm app enter a tile saying, hey, get yourself a Debit+, you'll know that we're starting to promote product quite aggressively. And again, we're not including anything in our guide about what Debit+ will do for us in the volume or revenue on ILTC basis just because it's a little bit too hard to model that right now. But we probably will talk about it quite more -- quite a lot more in terms of the actual expectations starting next calendar year. Hopefully, at least the point about, we will not risk our unit economics just to launch a cool new product sooner than we're ready, there\u2019s people give you to how we think about the economy today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: I'm on for Jason Kupferberg. I just want to ask just a couple of questions. First was in your Q1 results in the first quarter, I think you mentioned higher interest rates impacting gain on sale with pricing with certain forward flow buyers. Can you talk about that a little more? Obviously, I mean, I understand interest rates are up, but just trying to understand how often does that pricing get adjusted? And is the lower pricing like going to stay until I think these agreements tend to be 2, 3 years? So just trying to understand, does the lower gain on sale now you're kind of locked into those lower gain on sales for the next couple of years? Or how does that exactly work?\nMichael Linford: That's a good question, yes. And the commentary is really about the year-on-year comparison. The agreements vary. Some agreements are locked in for the duration of the contract. Some have regular repricing triggers and it varies with 6 months to even floating arrangement. So we kind of have lots of different flavors. But I wouldn't -- we're not -- I'm not worried about being locked in at the worst rate. I think a decline in rates would be good for us and then.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask about adjusted operating margin. The first quarter came in better than your guidance, but you -- I mean, obviously, the top line guidance is coming in a little bit. But you've also -- you're also slowing down hiring. Just trying to understand, was there something unusual about the first quarter, like some expenses got pushed to the second quarter or something? Just what's happening there? Anything to call out?\nMichael Linford: No. We did have a little bit of a benefit associated with some items that aren't repeatable throughout the course of the year, but the strength in the revenue less transaction cost is combined with slightly below hiring plan were the biggest drivers for us. In the first quarter, the reduction hiring plan is as much about managing the fiscal '24 number as it is about managing '23. Just think about the timing of the hiring that we have in the plan. Obviously, an employee we hire in the last day of the fiscal year doesn't really affect the profitability in the year, but it is extra costs that we take into next year. And I think the focus for us is to get our units as healthy as possible and to get the operating expense as right-sized as we can going into next fiscal year when we feel like we want to be as fit and lean and strong as possible.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson.\nEugene Simuni: Just got 1 question on the consumer engagement platform. So your transactions per active user keeps going up, which is great. It's a great sign of better engagement. But if we do the math on sort of dollars spent per active consumer, that keeps going down. And I understand that there might be some mix factors in here, perhaps Peloton is influencing that. But can you talk about that trend a little bit? And do you see a path to getting consumers to spend more dollars with your platform over time? And how -- what are the leverage you might be able to use to encourage them to do that?\nMax Levchin: So I think the -- there are kind of 2 competing vectors here. And to be completely honest, I track slightly different metrics. I care about average ticket size for every transaction and number of transactions per active user. Those are kind of my contours of our consumers engaging. And it is, in fact, the case that if you ask someone to spend more money through you with you -- sorry, if you're trying to convince consumers to use you more often, more transactions, you are absolutely signing up for smaller tickets, right? People aren't going to buy an exercise bike every quarter, and they're going to buy maybe a couch once a year or so, but then you're really trying to get high frequency, which is certainly what we're chasing here. You're looking at things like apparel, maybe tickets, travel. And so we're very active in all those industries, general merchandise umbrella name for everything you buy that kind of happens all the time. So AOV is just expected to continue coming down. It's an important measure of our success, frankly. I think the growth of transaction frequency per user is an indication of increasing spend in the [pain for] category, which is uniquely suitable for these shorter-term lower AOV transactions. And so that's for a lot of gris coming from. As you might expect, we've dominated high AOV longer periods for a very long time in the U.S. markets. We're still very rapidly expanding into the short-term lower AOV transactions. So I think in the long term, I care about trying to get to old transactions possible. And I think that will naturally result in the most possible number of dollars spent with Affirm by any 1 active consumer, but for now, we're very focused on making sure that we're there for the consumer in paid for in monthly payments. If the average ticket size goes down, that trend goes on success.\nMichael Linford: Just real quick on the math. I think the average is maybe -- I'm not quite sure what math you're doing and how you're looking at it, but the averages can really lie here. One $2300 purchase can look like a lot longer share of wallet even if it's not repeatable as opposed to those consumers who maybe would never entertain a $2300 purchase. I think, for the consumers that are engaging on our platform today, we definitely believe we have a higher share of their spend.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with SMBC Nikko Securities.\nAndrew Bauch: Just looking at the Affirm share of U.S. e-commerce spend, and this kind of dovetails with the prior question, is growing above the 2% in fiscal '23 and beyond and the trajectory of that, is that more of a function of you making progress on the consumer side? Or is it more around the continued expansion of wallet within merchants? I know they likely go hand in hand, but any other color you could provide would be great.\nMax Levchin: We are building a network. And 1 begets the other and back. I guess the -- assuming pretty good earlier today about 2% of e-commerce. And now I feel I got to shop with more soon. The good news is that we are currently integrated at about 60% of all U.S. e-commerce. So we can increase that 2% penetration by getting more share of wallet with the merchants. Our merchants really dependent on us in these inflationary times because consumers need to stretch their dollar and we're there for them. And we have a really healthy business that is generated from our own services in our app that some of it is merchant integrated, but a lot of it is not.  Still very excited about what the less will do for us. It extends us into things like daily purchase where we don't play today. And importantly, it gets us to offline, which is not included by 60% number, and for us is a nicely growing, but still very, very trivial amount of volume. So we have lots of ways of getting above that, too. When we get there, we'll -- I'll expect this will grow again at that point.\nAndrew Bauch: Just looking at the industry mix, I mean 1 that kind of sticks out to us is a pretty sizable opportunity that could grow over time would be the travel and ticketing segment, thinking about getting further into airline purchases or hotels. Maybe you could just speak about that, the vertical inside that opportunity and what obstacles or potential like roads to taking that 12% up over the next couple of years to be.\nMax Levchin: It's a great opportunity. I think it's a wonderful place to apply what we have to offer. We have a handful of really good partnerships in the travel industry today, both in airlines and -- hotels are probably least penetrated from our point of view. We have a bunch of online travel agency integrations that we've had for years and years and have done extraordinarily good work with them. Direct integrations with airlines is a little bit newer, and there's more to do there as well. The cool thing about travel, in general, it's kind of a sweet spot for what we know how to do. It's sort of a thing that others team really do very well. All these things, including -- I'll start far, but I'll get here in a second. But if you look at the work we've done with some of the largest big-box retailers and with the platforms, and now we're looking to do with hotels and expanding our work with OTAs, it is inevitably a thing you do not as much in credit and underwriting and understanding the consumer use case as you do in product. I can give you a very perfect example. Hotels, as you sort of think back to the last time you checked out, you pay and checkout except a lot of them you don't check out, you leave the key in the room and you walk. And so the actual exact mechanics of this transaction is now real. We know the total amount. And now we're going to turn it into a loan and you'll pay it over time. Just very, very different between hotels and buying a couch. And so inevitably to do this right to do as well to convert a lot of consumers to really deliver the value that our merchants expect us to, you have to build a product that is fine-tuned to that particular industry. And all of our long-term growth opportunities are built around our ability to create products that are unique and are very hard for others to replicate. So I feel very strongly about it. Obviously, for a long time, I used to say Affirm is a machine, engineers in, RLTC out, we\u2019re being very careful with hiring. So maybe some of these opportunities to get even bigger and faster, we'll probably do the right amount of discipline to it, but definitely varies in terms of travel. And there's probably 500 industries that didn't rattle off immediately. We\u2019re just the right product, and we'll break through and become bigger than average.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Zane Keller.\nZane Keller: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thank you, Zane. We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us. Our results reinforce the confidence we have in our strategy and Affirm's ability to capitalize on our opportunities. Two years ago, that was time we were preparing for a journey as a public company. We're now completing our eighth quarter as a publicly traded company, and it seems really good time to compare our results for the 12 months ending September 30, 2022, versus the 12 months ending December 31, 2020, which was the last calendar year as a private company for us. Since then, with comparison, we've more than tripled active consumers. We quintupled transactions almost. We grew transactions per active consumer 1.5 times, per transaction frequency by 50%, and near tripled our trailing 12-month GMV. Both have doubled our revenue and almost tripled revenue less transaction costs growing at up to $732 million. All while, we've been in control of our credit results. Delinquencies and net charge-offs remain at or below pre-pandemic levels, very important to us. We remain focused on long term, while making sure to navigate the present macro volatility very possibly. We're continuing to obsess over risk and transaction costs to maintain a strong unit economics. We will shift features that improve network scale and profitability like we always have. We're going to manage our OpEx carefully while investing in our highest conviction product opportunities. We're building deep connections with consumers and merchants who need us now more than ever before. Both sides of our network can navigate economic uncertainty and we see this as an opportunity to solidify our position as a trusted and reliable partner. Back to you, Zane. I'll start and I think Michael can probably help quantify second half of the question. So just to set the stage, the most important thing to take away from us, we are not just managing credit outcomes, we set them. The whole point of these ultra short-term 4.6 months weighted average life of every loan, every transaction is underwritten. We have full control of transactions requiring down payment, or not, we control the amount of down payment, et cetera, cetera. So we have lots of levers we use to control risk. We've said about talked about this many, many times, but never gets old. And that gives us a lot of very nimble controls over the actual credit outcomes. So we set a number we want to hit. Obviously, every week, we get a stack full of new formation going back all the cohorts that are still active, and we adjust credit that we have been now managing it quite actively to make sure that we get to the numbers that we require. Because the back book runs off very quickly, we have a lot of control. This compares pretty favorably with the rest of the industry that does things like credit card consolidation loans or personal loans that go back years and there's nothing you can do about it. So that's just a really important thing to understand. And again, I apologize for -- to those who from this sounds like just an old repeat, but this really is how this business works. And the reason our numbers are strong as they are today, and you can see this in the letter, is not an accident. It's not as though the world hasn't changed. There's plenty of stress on the consumer in the lower income brackets, lower credit quality. We're just good at managing, and we do underwrite every transaction, and therefore, we have a lot of control. So that's sort of the backdrop. The counterpoint to this is the demand for BPL is increasing. We serve our consumers, we see demand in the application side of things. Generally speaking, people are turning -- not just going to look at credit cards, people are turning to more than they used to do that. I mean we're not done in the higher income brackets spending through the pandemic stimulus, but they're getting closer, probably sometime mid next year is when we'll see the exhaustion of those savings. But today, the lower income groups are already done and they're trying to turn to various forms of debt. We believe pretty firmly we have done the best alternative out there. We have 85% repeat transaction from existing consumers to prove that. And so you have enough demand, and we do have a lot. We have enough diversity of merchants where as folks shift out of Connected Fitness and finance our homewares you go for big box, more commodity purchase. We are there to help them with all those things. And so demand is still quite strong. If we have control, as we do all of our credit outcomes, we can manage to the number that we need at once. That's sort of how we're doing it. Michael can give you a little bit more data on exactly where we intend to run it. But again, this is the choice we have as opposed to a thing we have to contend with. Strong plus one to Michael, please have a look at what we put out in the letter. We really wanted to communicate very clearly to our investors that this is the one piece of the business that matters to us, should matter for our investors, and we are in full control, and we look at these things on a over-debt basis as we think you should. So probably the most important thing to respond to, the CFPB point. I don't know if you had a chance to read it. From my point of view, it's a great document describing the state of the industry. I think they did a pretty thorough job both interviewing and summarizing what the industry is doing. Gratifying to have my S1 letter quoted in the CFPB report, that was an interesting highlight. No, I don't think our road map has changed at all. In fact, if you look in many ways, the letter essentially highlights that there's lots of companies in the BNPL space. And there's one that's very different. And they didn't go as far as naming us, but we're the only ones who doesn't charge late fees, doesn't have a sort of other shenanigans that regulators really dislike. And so I feel pretty great about what I said there. Probably the most interesting sort of material thing in their note is coming in the industry essentially to help consumers build their credit history and credit scores through the NPL loans. And we've been working pretty closely with the accredited reporting agencies and various other participants in the industry to help further that along. And so we'll definitely continue listening to what the regulators have to say in the matter and that our own ideas, et cetera. But generally speaking, I felt that it was a very positive thing for the industry and certainly for a firm. Our road map is not impacted. Brand-sponsored promotions are, I would say, you'll see more of them going forward. It has two components to it. One is the build-out of the -- what takes engineering is the product has to be actually fully built and we are making pretty great progress there. I don't quite have all the building littles that I want, but it's a thing that's live in a bunch of places. And then it becomes a matter of sales where you actually have to bring it to merchants and manufacturers and brands. And so we're getting on that. Like everything else we do, these things will take time to build. I think we'll, at some point, break them out to sell off just how cool they are and how margin-rich they become, but that's probably a conversation for another time. I feel like I may answer the question. Was there more to it? Yes. No. Thank you. I think I covered it. I don't have to say more. So you're right. We have not, generally speaking, moved prices on either consumers or merchants to date. I think everyone -- but everyone understands that our largest supplier increased their price threefold, as Michael put it the other day. And at some point, one does pass the cost on to their customers. The process with merchants is a little bit different based on the type of the partnership. So obviously, some of our largest merchant GMV segments come from platform partnerships like Shopify. Others are individual platform like Editis, G Walmart and Amazon. And then there's a whole list of directly any rigs that are either on the platform or not, but we have a direct relationship. There's no third-party platform involved. Those are probably the buckets. In the case of fully directly integrated folks, it's a notification that there's different contractual time lines that we've committed to, to giving them notice change of price. Obviously, they have some ways of reacting, for example, like a virus in some cases, in other cases, they can try to negotiate, et cetera, in the platform and the really large quantity platform merchants. Obviously, it's a little bit more of a conversation because they are responsible for a whole host of underlying merchants that have -- and have other financial relationships with those folks. So a lot of times, it depends a little bit on their schedule of raising their own prices, which they may or may not be thinking about. And so the merchant side of the equation is a little bit slower moving. The consumer side, we obviously have quite a lot more control because obviously, every transaction is underwritten and the price and it does change based on credit quality and what we're seeing, et cetera. And we have to follow their lending laws, so we can't change on one person or the other. So there's a fair amount of consideration there. All that said, we've done this before. At the very beginning of the pandemic, we went to our merchants and told them that we have no idea what's going to happen next, but we expect our risk to go up very substantially. And therefore, we will price it in with them. At that time, I think exactly zero merchants fired us or did anything but say, we get it, we're going to work with you because it's important for us to continue selling. So feel pretty strongly about our ability to command the price for our products and include the fluctuations that we see in our supply. But it's not an instant switch, but it's something that we've done before. I feel very confident we're able to execute on if we should decide to do so. I'm going to try really hard not to sound glib and spike the football and take victory laps, et cetera, the short answer is yes. I've been saying this for a long time that we're about to quote about tide coming out and noticing that some people are swimming without trunks on. I wouldn't exactly classify our state of affairs as struggling, but I do believe some of our competitors are. And it is accretive to us. We have merchants coming in and saying, \"Hey, would you guys consider side-by-side with a competitor?\" And where in the past, we would come in and ask them will they consider it, and they'd say they were fine, the approvals are good, and now approvals are not. And ours are still doing quite well. So that just makes it that much easier to take share. Sometimes side by side, sometimes and probably could rattle off into brands that are turning us on either instead of or alongside some of our esteemed competitors because they feel they the need to continue driving their top line and the competition no longer can approve as well as they used to. So yes, it's been quite helpful to us, so long as we continue hitting our numbers on credit, which we absolutely tend to do, and keep approvals high, which should give you a sense that all these quarters I've been promising that the curve is really steep. We need to move our GMV just a little bit to reduce our prospective losses by a lot. It seems to be working out the way we promised it. So long as it keeps going, we'll continue taking share. I'll start on the credit side, and Michael probably has comments on the rate side of things. So we are anticipating some degree of worsening on the credit side of things. That said, we really concern ourselves with the next 4.5 months of volume. That's just really, really important to mitigate. Our ability to manage credit to the numbers that we choose is a consequence of our ability to underwrite and get the data sources that we need and make it -- do it very quickly. But probably the single most important structural part of how we're different from everyone else in the market is we have very short-term product. We're not granting lines, which means that a credit decision we made today, even if it's erroneous, will be the last time we made that mistake. And we're able to deal with a lot more demand that we choose to lend. And so as consumers feel more stretched, they come to us more often. That does not change that we apply the same level of diligence and care to every loan that we underwrite. And so we are primarily focusing on making sure that our data sources are fresh, that our models react correctly to the change in consumer behavior, which we have absolutely seen, given just over the last 5, 6 years of operating, including the last 6 months of the current macroeconomic volatility. So all of that is fed into how we underwrite, but our ability to weather the whatever incoming storm might be headed our way is deeply rooted in the fact that we make very, very short-term, relatively speaking, credit decisions. And we have no shortage of demand for our product. I'll pause there. I just want to had another point to make, but Michael has a few. One last thing -- sorry, on that point, the point that I was going to make I blanked on. So 1 of the other things that we have because of the Adaptive Checkout, which we had the presence of wanting to launch about a year ago, the menu of terms the consumer will see is programmatically determined by us. And so we have enormous amount of control over this, 4.6% average. The product isn't just in of itself short, we also get to decide whether a particular credit quality applicant sees the longest or longer durations versus the shorter ones. And so 1 of the things that you could say we're preparing to do, although we don't have to act on it right now, if we felt that the unemployment is about to spike or starting to go up really rapidly, we would necessarily pull in terms and make the 4.6% average go down just to make sure there are fewer opportunities for our borrowers to default. So that's another level of control that we have. And that typically corresponds very nicely just from research and past lives with the shift from luxury buying to general merchandise purchasing. People don't need to borrow quite as much, and therefore, shorter terms make more sense for the cash flow. So this actually should not have the real impact on our take rate on the consumer side but will reduce our risk. I've attempted to make some sort of read my lips joke, but I will not. We will hit profitability on schedule. We are not pushing off profitability. The product we're focusing on are about creating more RLTC, creating -- mitigating some of the rate volatility. But ultimately, we feel very good about our schedule. We are not suffering from any need to postpone on our deed with destiny. I think I'm not supposed to say that, but I like the alliteration. Act of God are not included in our guidance. The approval rate has actually stayed relatively flat throughout the quarter. In fact, they basically stayed flat for the last 9 months, if memory serves, with a slight uptick in the interim -- in the 3 months in between. The first 3 and the last 3, we actually increased the approval rate a little bit. And so maybe this month -- this quarter, it went down a tiny bit. But this is sort of back to the products that we offer consumers. So we have an enormous amount of control over the actual shape of the risk we're going to take on. We, generally speaking, have a way of finding a way to say yes to a consumer. If somebody comes in and says, \"Hey, I want to borrow x $100 over y months or weeks,\" in some situations, the answer is, no, that's not going to happen because we just don't think you can carry this much cash flow burden on a monthly basis. However, we're very happy to help you with a lower monthly number if you're willing to prepay the delta basically. And that have a dozen other levers that allow us to shape the risk we take and make sure we need the consumers where they are without adding unnecessary burden to our provision. So we have been certainly very active in using those levers. We do this at the merchant by merchant level, sometimes SKU by SKU level because we can infer which products are getting prioritized how and repayments and things like that. But to date, we have not needed to slam the brakes on approvals. And again, and I said it before, credit is job number one. We will always prioritize managing to numbers that we feel we must hit to ensure capital partners see us as the best yield, most predictable yield generator for them. But that does not need for us that we have to turn people away at the door. It does mean that some people will have a slightly larger down payment request. In some cases, we will ask for more information. In some cases, this means that we need to see their cash flow data, which is somewhat burdensome, but it's better than being told no. And so we have a lot of confidence in our ability to maintain rates. And while we don't generally speak and contractually agree to guaranteed approvals with our merchants, the reason they keep us hired, if you will, and the reason they like to hire us over our competitors, because we always deliver on approval rates, first and foremost, and that helps them drive their top line and sales that wouldn't have happened without Affirm. Thank you for asking. I was wondering if somebody might remember. So actually trying not to be glib. So 1 of the things that I could do a year ago as the Product in Chief and don't feel like I can now is roll out a product with economics that I don't feel are fundamentally accretive to the business. So sometimes I think in the beginning of last quarter or right around that time, we've basically taken the week list that we generated and given a pretty meaningful number of people sort of tens of thousands of active cards type level cards to observe the usage. As with every new credit product, you end up with economics you don't particularly like. And we spent the last 3 months just really chiseling away at all the various fraud vectors and loss possibilities and a whole bunch of new kind of losses that happen in debit loss. There's obviously pre-transaction, which is very similar to -- for many of the product that we have inside the SuperApp. There's the post one, which is where you swipe and then you choose to split, how these are a 24-hour limbo where the transaction might turn into pay now or could become pay later. And then there's also inhibition funds, which is the pay now can become a default and write-off.  So there's a bunch of new vectors, both intentional, unintentional losses, spent the last 3 months just really making sure that we feel good about the unit economics of this product. We're almost there. I feel very good about it. And probably January 1 is kind of a realistic time line when we're going to start pushing this forward. Again, the product that is brand new, we're not going to, given today's reality of the question about our term profitability, nothing will be more frustrating than saying everything is awesome, we're hitting every number, except debit loss turn out to be loss here than I thought. So sorry about that profitability is postponed. That will not happen. That said, I feel quite good about where the profitability of that product is today. I'll feel a lot better in January we have a whole bunch more planned. And that's when we expect to start actually delivering these cards. And you will know this pretty easily right now to get to Debit+, you have to either be in the selected group or we promote it or you kind of have to know your way. I mean you can go on if you want it, but it's a little bit of work. The day you see your Affirm app enter a tile saying, hey, get yourself a Debit+, you'll know that we're starting to promote product quite aggressively. And again, we're not including anything in our guide about what Debit+ will do for us in the volume or revenue on ILTC basis just because it's a little bit too hard to model that right now. But we probably will talk about it quite more -- quite a lot more in terms of the actual expectations starting next calendar year. Hopefully, at least the point about, we will not risk our unit economics just to launch a cool new product sooner than we're ready, there\u2019s people give you to how we think about the economy today. So I think the -- there are kind of 2 competing vectors here. And to be completely honest, I track slightly different metrics. I care about average ticket size for every transaction and number of transactions per active user. Those are kind of my contours of our consumers engaging. And it is, in fact, the case that if you ask someone to spend more money through you with you -- sorry, if you're trying to convince consumers to use you more often, more transactions, you are absolutely signing up for smaller tickets, right? People aren't going to buy an exercise bike every quarter, and they're going to buy maybe a couch once a year or so, but then you're really trying to get high frequency, which is certainly what we're chasing here. You're looking at things like apparel, maybe tickets, travel. And so we're very active in all those industries, general merchandise umbrella name for everything you buy that kind of happens all the time. So AOV is just expected to continue coming down. It's an important measure of our success, frankly. I think the growth of transaction frequency per user is an indication of increasing spend in the [pain for] category, which is uniquely suitable for these shorter-term lower AOV transactions. And so that's for a lot of gris coming from. As you might expect, we've dominated high AOV longer periods for a very long time in the U.S. markets. We're still very rapidly expanding into the short-term lower AOV transactions. So I think in the long term, I care about trying to get to old transactions possible. And I think that will naturally result in the most possible number of dollars spent with Affirm by any 1 active consumer, but for now, we're very focused on making sure that we're there for the consumer in paid for in monthly payments. If the average ticket size goes down, that trend goes on success. We are building a network. And 1 begets the other and back. I guess the -- assuming pretty good earlier today about 2% of e-commerce. And now I feel I got to shop with more soon. The good news is that we are currently integrated at about 60% of all U.S. e-commerce. So we can increase that 2% penetration by getting more share of wallet with the merchants. Our merchants really dependent on us in these inflationary times because consumers need to stretch their dollar and we're there for them. And we have a really healthy business that is generated from our own services in our app that some of it is merchant integrated, but a lot of it is not.  Still very excited about what the less will do for us. It extends us into things like daily purchase where we don't play today. And importantly, it gets us to offline, which is not included by 60% number, and for us is a nicely growing, but still very, very trivial amount of volume. So we have lots of ways of getting above that, too. When we get there, we'll -- I'll expect this will grow again at that point. It's a great opportunity. I think it's a wonderful place to apply what we have to offer. We have a handful of really good partnerships in the travel industry today, both in airlines and -- hotels are probably least penetrated from our point of view. We have a bunch of online travel agency integrations that we've had for years and years and have done extraordinarily good work with them. Direct integrations with airlines is a little bit newer, and there's more to do there as well. The cool thing about travel, in general, it's kind of a sweet spot for what we know how to do. It's sort of a thing that others team really do very well. All these things, including -- I'll start far, but I'll get here in a second. But if you look at the work we've done with some of the largest big-box retailers and with the platforms, and now we're looking to do with hotels and expanding our work with OTAs, it is inevitably a thing you do not as much in credit and underwriting and understanding the consumer use case as you do in product. I can give you a very perfect example. Hotels, as you sort of think back to the last time you checked out, you pay and checkout except a lot of them you don't check out, you leave the key in the room and you walk. And so the actual exact mechanics of this transaction is now real. We know the total amount. And now we're going to turn it into a loan and you'll pay it over time. Just very, very different between hotels and buying a couch. And so inevitably to do this right to do as well to convert a lot of consumers to really deliver the value that our merchants expect us to, you have to build a product that is fine-tuned to that particular industry. And all of our long-term growth opportunities are built around our ability to create products that are unique and are very hard for others to replicate. So I feel very strongly about it. Obviously, for a long time, I used to say Affirm is a machine, engineers in, RLTC out, we\u2019re being very careful with hiring. So maybe some of these opportunities to get even bigger and faster, we'll probably do the right amount of discipline to it, but definitely varies in terms of travel. And there's probably 500 industries that didn't rattle off immediately. We\u2019re just the right product, and we'll break through and become bigger than average."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "James, thanks for the question. Yes, we are still very much on time and on pace to achieve the profitability goal that we outlined, which just to recap everybody, we talked about getting to profitability starting in the first day of our fiscal '24. We said on a sustainable basis, meaning that we'll intend to do it repeatedly most of the time and looking at adjusted operating income. And so for us, the challenge is some pretty simple math. We need our revenue less transaction costs to be greater than the adjusted operating expenses that we have below the transaction cost line. The key things for us then are making sure we're doing everything we can to maximize the unit economics in the business. And if you look at our back half of the year road map, we have a lot of focus on making sure we're doing all that we can and should do there as Max outlined in the letter. And we're going to be mindful about controlling our operating expenses. And to that, that means being very careful, in particular, on hiring, but also making sure that we're not having any pockets of waste in the business. As we continue to scale the business and make the right investments, we also don't want to have dollars waste in the system. If you look at our kind of guidance, the back half of the year and the adjusted operating expenses that are implied by that, we feel like we'll put this in a really fit shape so that we'd be exiting right where we want to be to achieve that goal for next year. That's right. And it varies by product, and it varies by merchants that we're at. So I think your point is very well taken that we do see substantial improvements in credit quality as we see more repeat usage. And I'll note that we're still acquiring new users at a pretty good clip and thinking about the business is still feeling and we're not done with the acquisition side of the equation, certainly not on a gross basis. The additional disclosures that we've got now in the shareholder letter would really encourage folks to spend some time with them, both looking at the delinquency trends, which we now show 30, 60, 90 as well as we've got the net cohort ties, net charge-off curves for our monthly loans and then given you some trending that you can see on. And I think the biggest takeaway for all of those is that we are dialing in where these things are. It's going to be a week or a month that varies up or down, but we get to dial in where those losses, and that's such an important strategic piece of this business, that we can take that loss, then we can have confidence in how we think about the credit losses with respect to our capital partners, we have confidence in how it affects our P&L and allows us to confidently go approve to a very deep level. I think if you put us up against most of the people in the traditional financial institution world or most people who do unsecured consumer lending, our results are really good. And we feel like that is a real strength for us, and we're not going to treat it lightly. That's something we're going to continue to do, first and foremost, as it's an important aspect in everything that we do. While waiting, just for what it's worth, I'm not the only person who looks at credit at this company. I'm one of the very significant number of you does that. But when I look at our credit outcomes, I look at over tied data basically performance by vintage. Excellent question. So the short answer is there's a number against across merchant, consumer pricing and the rest of our transaction cost line items that are not reflected in our guide. Those remain as upside and a little bit, if you will, so how we think about the guidance, we want to be really careful to put in the guidance things that we are certain about as opposed to things that we hope will deliver and help close the gap. And that's why we, for example, look at the current forward curve. We don't have a proprietary house view of rates. And we try to look at the current shift and live features of the product. And so there is some aspect of higher APR, but the majority of the opportunity for higher APRs to consumers is not reflected in the guide as is the opportunity we have on the merchant side from a pricing perspective. Yes. The thing we're pointing out in the letter is that we think, we'll be slightly above the 5% equity capital required, which as you know, we've been running substantially lower than that over the past several quarters. That does reflect what we think will be a higher usage of balance sheet, in particular, where health financing into this quarter. So let me answer the broader question for assuming all the way out. We have a lot of conviction and confidence in our ability to fund the business. I don't think we're worried about that at all. The question for us is going to be the shape of the P&L as it goes through the various funding models that we have. And it is the case that we will have slightly more on balance sheet, which means that as you see in the Q2 guide for that revenue less transaction costs, you have two factors that are really affecting that number in the quarter and the reason for the back half of the year acceleration. They are the late in the quarter origination, late November into December origination of interest-bearing loans that end up on the balance sheet. That creates a lot of vertical pressure, meaning the period Q2 results will be depressed on a percentage of GMV. When you look out to the back half of the year, we're implying acceleration a pretty meaningful one in revenue less transaction cost. That is an assumption of a material change in the economics of the business that simply the stuff that we'll originate in Q2 flowing through the P&L in the back half of the year. The opportunities in that again that you alluded to at the very top, those have actually just be on top of or in addition to the acceleration that we're currently going to. Yes. So I think there's two drivers, and then there's some math you can do. The biggest drivers are Peloton, both and most acutely in our second quarter. So to give you some context, in our second quarter, we talk about a GMV growth rate that would be 40% instead of the guided to 31% in the second quarter. And we'd estimate that on a revenue basis, we would be up 29% in the second quarter instead of 16%. Obviously, that's a very material headwind with respect to the top line measures in the business. Back half of the year, that starts to attenuate quite a bit. But in the back half of the year, we are modeling the impact of the movement in rates. And we talked a lot about there being roughly 30 basis points of headwind, of which we're mitigating roughly half of that in our guidance in terms of the RLTC take rate. And so those are the 2 biggest drivers. It's important to talk about the cause -- those are the effects and the root causes. But one of the important things as we were just talking about is as we use the balance sheet a little bit more in Q2, you're going to, again, change the shape a little bit of that margin and that will continue on throughout the course of the year. But we think it's more of a onetime change in terms of the warehouse usage that we'll see next quarter, and we'll run the business at that level for the next couple of quarters, which will result in more revenue that we'll earn later for originations, and that trend will show up as you'd expect. Honestly, I think it's as much anything actually observing the impact that our counterparties are flowing through rates. When we gave that initial framework back in February of this year, we were taking into account a lot of the potential first and second order effects. And obviously, we were doing it -- we gave you a framework to think about it as every 100 basis points, there's a second or third order effect, too, because the set of the curve begins to affect decisions and I think it's more just as we've observed and seen the impact, we're just updating the range for everybody. And then in terms of the kind of back half of the year. And I understand the question correctly, you're talking about that LTC as a percentage of GMV, improving pretty meaningfully in the back half of the year. It's really just really simple math. As you put more interest-bearing loans on the balance sheet, you defer or you earn the revenue as those interest payments are made throughout the course of the loan. So if you take a 12-month loan that's originated on in December, for example, most of that income happened in the back half of the year. What's important, though, is the provision for credit losses for those loans will happen upfront. And so that means as you get less revenue, less transaction costs in the period, even though those loans are very good and profitable for us throughout the year. But then more broadly, I think it's just really important to remember how early we are with these large partners and with the program overall. We talked about some mitigants earlier that are things that we're working on right now, but don't yet have reflected in the forecast. That's on top of the very long list of projects that we have that focus on the unit economics, as Max talked about in the letter. And that's the ordinary course of business. There's something special about that, but something that we would and will continue to do regardless. And those can range from settle optimizations that we have on the process play page, tweaks that we can make to how our app search feature work to really drive better revenue take in the period and the list goes on. And those optimizations and those opportunities represent for us a lot of the upside here. But the primary driver in the guidance is the flow-through of the larger balance sheet in experience. Yes. So we always provision at the time of purchase. Well, when we own it, strictly speaking. And so that's always the case. The difference is as we -- on the margin, we'll have less marginal growth dollars being sold versus place on the balance sheet, you'll just -- you'll actually carry the provision versus getting the gain on sale and no provision. And so like the income profile just changes a little bit as you think about those loans being on the balance sheet versus off. We can't quantify. We're not disclosing GMV by partner here. What I would point you to is we do disclose the near 500% or over 500% growth in the general merchandise category that does pick up a number of merchants, including Amazon, Walmart and Target. Those are big, all of which had growth and strong growth, but we're not breaking out GMV by part. Yes. So there is a seasonal pattern to credit performance in our experience that relates to both the purchasing patterns consumers have as well as certain key cash flow milestones like, for example, the tax refund time lines. What you saw during the pandemic was pretty a big surge of available monetary supply and liquidity given to consumers, which really did affect pretty substantially what was in the ordinary pattern that you'd expect to see. And so as we're kind of shedding all of that excess consumer liquidity, I think you're going to see a more normal pattern for consumer credit trends in terms of the seasonality. And that's why we're referencing back to the pre-pandemic period. And if you see on Page 10 of our letter, you'll see us sitting around on top of the FY '20 pre-pandemic trends, which we feel like is, again, right where we'd like the business to be. And I would say that the tone from a lot of merchants right now, there's two pieces that are tugging around this conversation. One is a lot are focused on margin. And all of our merchant partners, and clearly, anything that's perceived as an additional cost is under a lot of scrutiny. On the other hand, I think a lot of merchants are looking at their own outlook, the holiday season and to early part of next year and are looking for ways they can get back some of that growth in volume they had before. Those two things always net out to a good deal that allows us to the economist we need and drive the volume that we need to them. But it is unconstrained. Merchants do have real margin constraints services right now. Yes. Go ahead. Yes. Again, I would -- I'd start with, first, just how we think about the reserve. I think some financial institutions have a team of economists who are thinking about the state of the consumer and trying to make a forecast with their reserves. If we did that by the time we got the answers from the every tower, the loans would have paid back. And so instead what we do is we look at the actual performance of the loans, and we look at the [IPAC] score, the credit score that we give loans when they\u2019re originated, and use those 2 things to indicate how those loans will perform. And then we look at whether or not those predictions of performance are holding up. And that's very math-driven. We're not sitting here with a lot of judgment up and down or prognostication about future trends and deterioration in credit. It's very math and model driven. And if you look at, for example, again on Slide 11, our Page 11 of the letter, [indiscernible] for loan performance, you see pretty material reduction in the credit losses that we have for our pay-for-product. While it does turn over very fast, it isn't the biggest part of our allowance, it is all on the balance sheet and will continue to be and therefore has, as you improve the quality of losses in that product, you're obviously going to see less allowance needed for it.  And similarly, I think a lot of the stress that we talked about starting to see in the end of our last fiscal year, the mitigates that we took resulted in us originating a higher quality asset going into this quarter and into the back half of this year. And that higher-quality asset would suggest it has a lower loss content. It's a good thing. It's not that -- it's not a bad thing. It's a very good thing that we estimate less losses in the loans that we're originating. There's definitely an impact of credit on our volume. It's just nowhere near as substantial as I think some folks might think. The far bigger impact in the update in our guidance is the impact that we saw from Peloton. When you take a business that has a lot of headwind like that, we thought we were being pretty conservative in our outlook for that business this year. And I think that it's underperformed even where we had set that bar. And that's the biggest driver of the reduction in the guidance for the year. We haven't given a way to quantify it, but we don't take that, for example, the movement in the guidance is because we sequentially have tightened our view on credit. No, just -- look, the way we approach it is always to take the current consensus, to take the forward curve or a rate assumption, we don't try to grow. And there's a number of scenarios that could play out very differently. As you point out, we could enter into a recession and have more employment. Of course, that would probably have come with less pressure on rates than we're probably currently modeling. And the flip side is the rate probably could get worse and employment could continue to be very robust. And I think we're trying to just be middle of the road here and be very close around when we're assuming that the current macro consensus is where the business is -- what will play out, understanding that this forecast are always wrong, but we have to make sure of something. And so just like we did when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year, we're going to peg it to the rate curve. And as rates move, you should expect that to impact our businesses with the framework that we given in. And then the last thing is we take our guidance really seriously, we grow our thought onto it. And if our guidance moves because we think something has changed, and I think what you saw on the GMV outlook here, as we talked about, a pretty big impact of Peloton. And then obviously, we're digesting a pretty big headwind in rate. There are certainly macro conditions that could make that goal and objective not come through, but we feel very confident as we sit here today. That's a good question, yes. And the commentary is really about the year-on-year comparison. The agreements vary. Some agreements are locked in for the duration of the contract. Some have regular repricing triggers and it varies with 6 months to even floating arrangement. So we kind of have lots of different flavors. But I wouldn't -- we're not -- I'm not worried about being locked in at the worst rate. I think a decline in rates would be good for us and then. No. We did have a little bit of a benefit associated with some items that aren't repeatable throughout the course of the year, but the strength in the revenue less transaction cost is combined with slightly below hiring plan were the biggest drivers for us. In the first quarter, the reduction hiring plan is as much about managing the fiscal '24 number as it is about managing '23. Just think about the timing of the hiring that we have in the plan. Obviously, an employee we hire in the last day of the fiscal year doesn't really affect the profitability in the year, but it is extra costs that we take into next year. And I think the focus for us is to get our units as healthy as possible and to get the operating expense as right-sized as we can going into next fiscal year when we feel like we want to be as fit and lean and strong as possible. Just real quick on the math. I think the average is maybe -- I'm not quite sure what math you're doing and how you're looking at it, but the averages can really lie here. One $2300 purchase can look like a lot longer share of wallet even if it's not repeatable as opposed to those consumers who maybe would never entertain a $2300 purchase. I think, for the consumers that are engaging on our platform today, we definitely believe we have a higher share of their spend."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Zane. You may begin.\nZane Keller: Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today and the company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them except as required by law. In addition today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings supplement slide deck, which is available on our Investor Relations website. Hosting today's call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer. In line with our practice in prior quarters, we will begin with brief opening remarks from Max before proceeding immediately into questions and answers. On that note, I will turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. Obviously, we had a killer quarter in fiscal year on both growth and profitability side of the ledger. So as is our custom, the better the results, the less comment I'll offer. There are some really good new stats in the letter that Michael and I attend, so please have a look at that. One thing though that's not in the letter that I did want to share, to build on a great momentum that we're having, to help us continue to scale in the long-term, we're evolving our leadership structure a little bit. Very excited to share that our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Michael Linford himself, will be taking on an expanded new role as Chief Operating Officer for Affirm. For now, he will remain our CFO, but today, we also have the talented and handsome Mr. Rob O'Hare a veteran of the Affirm finance team joining us on this call for a reason. I expect Rob to take on the CFO role by the end of this fiscal year, still reporting to Michael. Please make Rob feel welcome. He's a good man and thorough. Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller: Thank you, Max. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, thank you, guys. Good to see these numbers. I was curious if you could comment just as we think about fiscal 2025 guidance, just your general approach to assessing what the credit environment might look like. You obviously continue to control that extremely well. And maybe as part of that in this category of fiscal '25 assumptions, I know you said that B2B and some other newer initiatives, including the Apple Pay partnership are not expected to be material. But can you maybe tell us a little bit more about how you guys define material? Because it sounds like there may be something in the numbers for it, but would just love to unpack that a little bit. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Thank you. Great compound question. As is our custom, I'll give some high-level answers and Michael will probably contextualize it a little bit better than I can. So in terms of credit, just a friendly reminder to everybody, these numbers are not an accident. We decide what we want to see. Obviously, there is variability, but we have a really short-term exposure, our consumers don't borrow money from us for too long. Every transaction is underwritten separately. We are by design and definition, in control of our credit outcomes. But you see today are the numbers that we wanted to have and we're happy with that. We'll continue to do exactly the same thing. Every time we plan our credit outcomes, we tell ourselves what it is that we want to see in the DQs and that's what we typically end up with plus or minus minor noise. In terms of setting guidance, we did this last year, and we thought we kind of got the right solution or the right formula, and we repeat it again this time. We set the floor, as risk managers, we are inherently conservative people. We'd like to guide all of you to a number we feel is pretty well baked. We will get there. And then we turn around and tell the team, we got to do much better than this. We got to beat this number. This number is in the bag. Let's do go, go, let's do better. That's what happened in fiscal '24. That is our plan for fiscal '25. Now the thing that makes us some place to work at. Lots of things change. There will be something that's going to fall out of our plan for '25 because some really cool opportunity is going to come up and we'll prioritize the opportunity and we'll park waste temporarily with whatever it is that the opportunity will take the plays off. None of that is in the guide by design. We are putting in the guide what we think we will get to with a really good degree of certainty. That's the philosophy. Michael, can probably give you a little bit more color if you want.\nMichael Linford: Yes. And I think you see the growth rate implied in the Q1 guide is obviously those things are reflective of where we've actually seen progress for initiatives that have shipped and are already contributing. And that's where we're seeing an acceleration in GMV in Q1 so far. I think the broader question around the new initiatives things like B2B and our partnership with some of the wallets. The question materiality I should clarify is little end material. So we're not trying to use any sort of strict definition here. But for us, it really need to be hundreds of millions, billion dollar type range before we start thinking about it as influencing the trajectory in a material way. And so when we look at a lot of these opportunities, they're either not yet shipped, as is the case with several of our wallet partnerships where they are not live yet. We don't think it's prudent to try to guess the timing of those in terms of their impact. We retain a lot of confidence on how big they will be eventually, but are being very mindful around setting guidance that is stuff that's live in the ground and contributing today or that we have control and direct line of sight to, as opposed to things that could take a few quarters to roll out and therefore have more uncertainty to them. And so I think whether it's the wallet partnerships or any of our international initiatives, we're confident on the size and scale of those or else we wouldn't be spending time on them. But we're communicating to you that if they do end up being material, that would actually be material upside to the outlook that we provided for the fiscal year.\nJason Kupferberg: Very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nReginald Smith: Hey, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. I guess we've seen the business perform in a rising rate environment. I'm curious how you're thinking about the business in a potentially falling rate environment. And I'm curious around two things really, consumer spending, and then thinking about, I know you guys price each transaction uniquely with the APR. And I'm wondering if there may be some benefits to your model versus traditional credit cards, where the rates are pegged to the prime rate. And is there any play area for play in there in terms of pricing on the way down? Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Thanks, Reggie. Great question as always. There's a huge amount of benefits in not being tethered to a single price that was handed to you in the form of a line that flows precisely with the Fed Funds rate. The coupling is unnatural. We've always said it from the very beginning, this idea that you negotiate your credit card rate even if it's floating kind of once and for all, basically, and the merchant negotiates their acceptance rates once and for all, is bullish, like we live in the connected real-time world, why wouldn't we be negotiating these rates in real-time. And that's what we've built and that's why Affirm is successful, that's our innovation. As the rates move at large, as they go up, obviously, we end up having to pass some of the cost through as it hits us to consumers, practically, would this mean that at some point, someone who would have been approved will not be approved because the price is just not the number that we want to put. We have limits. We don't want to go above the Military Lending Act number, and that's a decision we made a long time ago and don't plan to change. As the rates come down, the very first consumer side impact will be better approval rates. Pricing is always fungible. We price things in real time. We can change it as we go. But the most exciting thing about reduction if Fed Fund Rate is we'll just have more active users. We'll have more new users. We'll have more repeat users because we'll be able to approve more people.\nMichael Linford: The only thing to add is the rate at which the rates change is very important. We saw a very quick rise in rates as rates went up, and you saw us react to those changing rates on the time line we talked about. We're very well positioned now to be reactive such that if they were to move that quickly again. I think we could move very quickly. But that's not in our assumption set. We don't believe that will happen. And I think we're talking about here a change in direction of rates more than the magnitude for the time being. And so very little change in the near-term based upon the booths that have already been priced in by the market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question this evening. RLTC fell above nicely above your range this quarter and I know you called out a presumably nonrecurring $30 million benefit from a single securitization. What are the key puts and takes we need to consider for our RLTC performance in 2025? Sort of in your internal planning, what are shaping up to be the bigger variables to keep in mind? Do we need to see Fed rates come down, funding costs come down a certain amount. Do we need to see credit performance hang in at certain levels? Where are the pressure points next year?\nMichael Linford: Yes. Good question. So again, on Q4, we did do a non-consolidated securitization. We don't do those every period. And so when we're able to do them, you do have a little bit of a chunky benefit, which pushed us slightly over the 4% range we'd like to think about as the ceiling. When you take that out, the RLTC rate in Q4 is pretty consistent with the guidance that we gave for Q1. So we think it's pretty stable sequentially. The big puts and takes are mostly related to mix of business that we are originating on the platform and the associated credit outcomes and then how we execute in the capital markets. I think the team has done a phenomenal job this past 12 months in broadening our access to really attractive capital sources and that's been done with ABS deals, be done with Ford [indiscernible] deals and we continue to think there's lots of opportunity for us to do more here. And certainly if we're able to do that, we can deliver strong margins. We are signing up for a 10 basis point expansion in the RLTC percent of GMV versus last year and we feel like that's possible because of a lot of the full year benefit of the and work that we've taken on, plus the fact that we do think we're in a very strong position with respect to the capital markets.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nWilliam Nance: Hey, guys. Nice results today. I appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on the kind of dovetailing off the earlier point around having a lot of control and visibility into the credit outcomes that you expect when you set the underwriting targets. I thought the stats in a different direction, the stats in the shareholder letter around the number of repeat users and repeat transactions increasing over time. I thought was interesting. And so I'm wondering if your visibility into forward volume is increasing to kind of a similar way where you now have a much better picture about how the volume trends might shake out over the coming year? I just thought it was interesting the increases in number of transactions per user and the number of repeat users. So how is that impacting the way that you look at the business internally and kind of plan for the coming year?\nMax Levchin: If we're on a kind of if you look at the gaps between those cohort curves, they're pretty big, which means that we're not yet struggling, if you will, to improve those numbers. So the fact that we are driving this outsized gain just means that there's a lot of work to do like the way we think about what's going to happen to be a Affirm card, for example, right now, we're on the order of $3,000 of annual spend. The right number from my point of view is $7,500 at least and on the order of 20 million active cards. That's the target. When we get there, I don't know, but that is what I think is both possible and required for us to succeed. Are we going to get their fiscal '25? Probably not, certainly not making any promise on that front, but the leads that we're showing in these charts speak for themselves. They're big. That means there's a lot of opportunity. So we forecast what we think we'll get and that's in the guide. And we got some really cool ideas and that a lot of them are going to work.\nWilliam Nance: Got it. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Bauch: Thanks for taking the question, guys. I wanted to talk about the sources of operating leverage there in the guide here. I mean you're calling for 18.4% AOI margins. I think that's a little bit better than what you had previously been guiding for, for the growth above 20%. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that as given the current growth profile and the strength of that number?\nMichael Linford: Yes. I think the one thing that we as a leadership team are really proud about is just how quickly we made progress on operating leverage in the business. I think we had a lot of conviction of where we would get to for a long time. The pace at which we were able to get there over the past 12 months has been phenomenal, and the Q4 results, I think, are a great data point on that trajectory. And I think that we feel that continuing to expand our margins is good discipline. And with that, gives us the focus we need to actually operate better. And the things that temper that are we do have a ton of opportunity ahead of us. And so we don't want to operate at terminal margins, we do want to show progress. And I believe that the JPMorgan Conference last May, this May, I outlined that we would expect to continue to expand margins. We're signing up for 200 basis points this year and feel like we still have quite a bit of runway of margin expansion to do into the future and that would just be tempered with the opportunities that we have to invest, in particular, in continuing to expand our team.\nAndrew Bauch: Good stuff, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Wildhack: Hi, guys. Maybe to take the earlier question on rate cuts and funding costs connected to the '25 outlook. Could you give some color on how much the current rate curve and expectations might be benefiting approvals in fiscal '25? And in that light, how much it could benefit the growth outlook?\nMax Levchin: It's a good question. We do not take into account the rate curve i.e. future market expectations of funding costs into our decisioning explicitly. It does get reflected as we negotiate capital deals, the market expectation of rates does get reflected into those deals. And so it affects our average cost of funding, which, in turn, affects our decisioning. But we don't we're not looking at and saying with two rate cuts on the horizon, it will get more aggressive. Instead, we look at our current funding costs and compare them to what we need to generate to be profitable on a transaction basis. And there is an important reason why these things flow through have been on a lagged basis. A lot of the funding sources we have are not floating rate funding facilities. And so our ABS deals, for example, have fixed cost of funds. So it will take a while for the deals that we've done over the past year, year and a half to be refinanced in the next two years. So the funding costs are a bit stickier which means it doesn't flow through quite as immediately as you might think.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay. Thanks. Would that mean then that if you get to say spring 2025 and rates are a lot lower than they are today, there would be potential upside on approvals? Because of the lower interest rate environment and lower funding costs?\nMichael Linford: With one caveat. If the reason why rates are being cut is because we're in a perfect economic scenario then yes. But of course, I think, we're mindful of the fact that thing is probably happening in that scenario is some pressure on the labor market, which has been very, very tight, it begins to loosen. We, of course, would need to take into account that as we think about where we set approvals.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please proceed with your question.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch a little bit on the outlook and particularly your growth expectations kind of between in the merchant network and card network revenue and interest in gain on sale and such. I guess which bucket are you guys expecting to be bigger contributor to growth in FY'25? And just how should we think about the split between the revenue streams?\nMichael Linford: So the thing that changes the mix across revenue streams is either the mix of originations and therefore the associated like loan content and then the capital strategies behind it. So as we lean a little bit more on gain on sale or get better pricing gain on sale, you see the gain on sale line go up. And equally as you have maybe higher MDR bearing loans, you'll see some increases there. I think really, it's difficult to identify, and we're not giving guidance on which line item for you to model out. But the root cause is that we made the asset more valuable. When you make the asset more valuable, you monetize it at a higher rate, and that's why we do think there's about 10 bps of more revenue, so pulling all the way down to the revenue less transaction cost part.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Dolev: Thanks. Great quarter, guys. And then congrats on the GAAP profitability in the fourth quarter. I wanted to ask about Apple Pay later. I think a couple of years ago when they announced that they're getting into by Buy Now Pay Later, the Affirm's talk was under pressure. Two years later, they capitulate, and you guys are handling the volumes. Like is there, maybe you can talk, Max, a little bit about like the fact that it's much more difficult to do Buy Now Pay Later than a lot of people think that it's just a product without a brand and without the ability to take risk appropriately because sounds like from an Apple perspective, there's much more to Affirm than what a lot of people were thinking.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Dan. Give Dan full credit. He totally front-ran my gap. Surprised by apparently correctly predicting it. Nice note. So on the Apple side, I don't think they're capitulating. I think they, if anything, are saying this Buy Now Pay Later thing is huge and important and it's not a feature. It's a major thing, that is just as important as credit cards that may be I certainly think it is more important than credit cards because it's a better way. Creating a platform for companies like Affirm to deliver the product with all the bells and whistles with all the unique things that we know how to do well is a very smart strategy. I don't think it's backing out of something, it's embracing the fact that this is a complicated really, really textured set of offerings that works in different ways for different audiences. The thing that there are a couple of things that don't need the eye readily, in our business that every time I think I've explained, I find that people don't necessarily fully understand, so who knows. But to sort of repeat the thing that I do try to explain on and on. Underwriting is hard. You got to get data. You got to get it in real time. You have to verify it for both validity and accuracy and timeliness and all the good stuff. And it's a real complicated thing that we do here really well. We've been at it for 13, 14 years almost now. And that's our DNA. People talk about AI as if it happened yesterday. We've been in what used to be known as AI for a lot longer than it was a thing that people throw around as a reason to lay off their employees. So we use a lot of machine learning and we do a lot of good work there. So that's hard. And unless you're focused on it you're not going to do as well as a specialist like we can. Part two, which is to call out and give props to our intrepid sales team, there's enormous effort involved in signing up merchants because what we offer is really incremental, but it's also really complex. We're coming to them and saying, credit cards cost you a couple of points. You should give us 3.5%, 5.5%, 7.5%, major slices of your margin for transactions that we promise you will be really, really incremental. And the way we're going to make it work is not by giving consumers flat out cash back or discounts or all sort of tired credit card tricks, we're going to give them access to credit on extraordinary terms. With no APR at all or really low subsidized APR, that's going to matter to a certain consumer in a really big way. We're going to do transparently at the point of sale as they make a decision, all that's going to come together, is going to help them decide. It's going to help them get off the sidelines and buy right now and help you Mr and Mrs Merchant, drive more volume. That is something you find out once you have been in the market and realize that, hey, this is actually what makes this product so special. The ability to, in real time, transfer part of the margin the merchant is willing to invest in a transaction to the consumer in a form of benefit. Having a real time network of hundreds of thousands of merchants that do that willingly because they've measured incrementality is really powerful. And that's what we spent the last decade doing in addition to building real AI that adds up to a lot of work and people that think it's the coolest thing to work on. I think creating a platform for companies like ours to deliver that through world's most popular phone the world's most popular wallet is awesome. So I'm obviously super stoked about what's happening there, but it's most certainly an embracement if that's a word versus a walk away. Sorry, for a bit of a rant.\nDan Dolev: No. This is super helpful. Well amazing results and congrats again on the promotion for both Rob and Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Thanks very much. I want to build a little bit on that last point there, Max. And just ask kind of in a more generalized way. How you're feeling right now about kind of the composition and profile of your customer base? And what are you thinking about in terms of ways and tools including some of those promotional capabilities you talked about to expand and maybe even improve such that you can get even beyond kind of that Affirm Card level of $7,500 in annual spend to something even better than that.\nMax Levchin: We definitely have no shortage of ideas. Let's see. So I think I'll try to keep it short because it has a real danger of becoming a very long-winded answer and I feel like I spent that bullet on the last question. We think of our consumers in segments. We obviously I think everybody should throw away the credit card and start using Affirm more often. But different consumers we have, have fairly different financial profiles and different needs. We have catchy nicknames for all of our segments, but practically, some people need access to credit and care a lot about things like lower monthly payments and more time to pay back and the fact that we don't charge them late fees if something happens and they need a little bit more time to pay back. And then on the other side of the spectrum, there are people who say, hey, I understand time value of money. I'm a sophisticated consumer of credit and I will transact if you give me a 0% rate. And those two are not the same person. We live in different segments. And there are different products that excite those people in profoundly different ways. Affirm Card is a great platform to offer all of those promotional vehicles to every segment. So we think it's a universal product that we can bring, but you will see us in the coming weeks, brilliant months, launch more and more features within the Affirm Card footprint that speaks to different segments in fairly different ways. You'll see 0% deals available to folks that we know really respond to those. We will offer longer clients to pay to those that really need that, that is available to our merchants as a configurable set of tools. We used to talk a lot about adaptive checkout. It's sort of old news. So it doesn't even get a mention in my letter, but it's still the cornerstone of a lot of our payment delivery technology, we have new products that we launched Pay in 2, Pay in 30. We have a few more that we're going to roll out. And all of that will live to serve our merchants to sell more merchandise in the way that converts the best with each consumer segment. At some point, I think, there will be full automation for merchants to just say, hey, let me give you x dollars and just get me as much conversion as you possibly can. That's my vision for the Nirvana. A merchant spend almost like buying AdWords like here's my dollars get me some transactions. Here's my dollars get me some conversions. We're obviously not quite there yet, but that's the direction which we're headed. The underlying tools for each segment will necessarily be different and that's by design. We understand our consumer a lot better because we understand what they're buying through SKU level data, et cetera.\nMichael Linford: And I would really encourage everybody to read the cohort engagement charts we have put in the letter. Everything Max mentioned is things that we're working on into the future to make it better. The stuff that's already in the ground, the products we already have out there are making great progress towards increasing engagement and it really jumps out at you when you start looking at just how much more engagement the recent cohorts have and the consistency with which the cohorts have grown in their engagement with us over time speaks to the underlying value of what we do for these consumers. And while we have a lot of confidence that we'll address more and more of their purchases over time.\nJames Faucette: That's great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on Apple Pay a little bit. Totally appreciate that for a specific customer, you might not want to go into too much detail, but I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the expected user experience with Affirm being at, I believe, at the onset maybe one of the main or only options for US online commerce, but the idea would be that over time, consumers using Apple Pay would have multiple options maybe other Buy Now Pay Later options. But also some of the card-based installment offerings. So if we could just talk about the user experience there and maybe the drop-down menu if you will. And then the second piece is around the unit economics, if the full range of products will be offered throughout that channel so that we should expect the unit economics to be still in that 3% to 4% range, maybe absent some degree of revenue share back to Apple? Thanks a lot.\nMax Levchin: I'll try to answer it in reverse order. So we'll be on the Apple Pay, which, by the way, not launched yet. So maybe I'll take it in the order you did ask. Not my role or right to unveil changes to our partners' product. So Apple will undoubtedly deliver beautiful experience, just given who they are will be a part of it. We're excited and proud to be and we'll all see exactly what it looks like when it rolls out, which hopefully will be reasonably soon now. On the economics part of it. So beyond Apple Pay, beyond any one major partner, we are not a wallet by design in definition. We are an ingredient brand. We are in that sense at least similar to Visa, MasterCard, Amex, et cetera, which means that we have an inherent tail conflict. When you go to a particularly wallet friendly website, you might find Affirm offer directly Affirm Card will be accepted because everyone takes Visa, you might find Apple Pay soon enough with us in it and Shop Pay because that's also available now off Shopify, at least in some retailers. And then there's Amazon Pay. And then there's Google Pay where we're also integrated and so on and on it goes. We are -- we aspire to be in every one of those channels, which means that when we compute the overall revenue less transaction cost metric we have to account for the possibility that the consumer will walk through any one of those doors. And we've been consistent in guiding to this idea that the business works really, really well between 3% and 4% when it gets over 4%, random securitization successes and time shift notwithstanding, above 4%, it's a little too rich, we shouldn't really be not investing those dollars and we're not approving enough people basically. Below 3% starts looking less attractive for us as shareholders. And so it will stay within 3% to 4% independent of the doors consumers will walk through. And that is certainly how we think about the business, when we enter any one of these giant partnerships and we've been extremely fortunate not entirely accidentally proud to call giant platforms, retailers and wallets our partners. We create systems and levers to help us navigate financial reality. We don't clearly know exactly the credit profile of the customer. We have expectations. We have hopes, but we don't know who's going to apply and precisely what approval rates we will be able to deliver et cetera. So as a result, we always structure these partnerships to make sure that in the end, it will adds up to 3% or 4%.\nTimothy Chiodo: Perfect. Thank you, Max.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill with FT Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew O'Neill: Thanks for taking my question, Max and Michael. Just wanted to focus in again on the I guess what you bolded in the shareholder letter around the intention and expectation to be profitable in this fourth quarter and therefore beyond and sort of dovetail onto some of the discussions that we had at the Investor Day around a longer-term aspiration of formalizing as a bank and so forth. Does this sort of accelerate that plan at all? Is that still something on kind of the medium-term time line? Any thoughts around that would be helpful. Thanks.\nMax Levchin: For the winds of doubt, we do not need to be a bank to conduct our business in the way that we'd like to conduct it. So that is one of the many routes available to us, under the right circumstances, but it is not in any way a requirement, that it's not a thing we are marching towards in any particular, the day we decided we're going to become a bank, we'll tell all of you, hey, we decided we're going to go become a bank. That has not happened and that's not what we're saying. GAAP profitability is really important and momentous. I would like the record to show that it involved no contortionism. It's actually a really important thing that as a, in this very moment, I want people to understand. We didn't roll out of it and said, well, gosh, now we have to go get GAAP profitable. We've been saying for literally years and years that we are on this track to make more transactions happen. The unit economics are great. We get enough transactions. We multiply that by the margin of each transaction. It's going to exceed both the fixed and then eventually the rest of the costs in the business. And now we can see it so clearly we are unafraid to say, hey, here's what's going to happen. But it is a commentary on a natural course of the business while we invest all of our available cycles and dollars in growth managing credit and all the things that we do here. And so as much as it I put it in bold because I wanted people to know we take it seriously, we mean it. We are absolutely going to get there. We feel great about where the business is. But in no part of it is a, oh, fine we'll cave. We were always on this journey and now we see a destination. Beyond that we'll have another reveal. I don't know what it's going to be. Probably won't be returning bank, by the way, but it will be something else and something interesting, some kind of financial metric, Michael, will come up or Rob will come up with actually by the end of this year.\nMatthew O'Neill: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to pass the call back over to Zane Keller.\nZane Keller: Thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thank you, Zane. Obviously, we had a killer quarter in fiscal year on both growth and profitability side of the ledger. So as is our custom, the better the results, the less comment I'll offer. There are some really good new stats in the letter that Michael and I attend, so please have a look at that. One thing though that's not in the letter that I did want to share, to build on a great momentum that we're having, to help us continue to scale in the long-term, we're evolving our leadership structure a little bit. Very excited to share that our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Michael Linford himself, will be taking on an expanded new role as Chief Operating Officer for Affirm. For now, he will remain our CFO, but today, we also have the talented and handsome Mr. Rob O'Hare a veteran of the Affirm finance team joining us on this call for a reason. I expect Rob to take on the CFO role by the end of this fiscal year, still reporting to Michael. Please make Rob feel welcome. He's a good man and thorough. Back to you, Zane. Thank you. Great compound question. As is our custom, I'll give some high-level answers and Michael will probably contextualize it a little bit better than I can. So in terms of credit, just a friendly reminder to everybody, these numbers are not an accident. We decide what we want to see. Obviously, there is variability, but we have a really short-term exposure, our consumers don't borrow money from us for too long. Every transaction is underwritten separately. We are by design and definition, in control of our credit outcomes. But you see today are the numbers that we wanted to have and we're happy with that. We'll continue to do exactly the same thing. Every time we plan our credit outcomes, we tell ourselves what it is that we want to see in the DQs and that's what we typically end up with plus or minus minor noise. In terms of setting guidance, we did this last year, and we thought we kind of got the right solution or the right formula, and we repeat it again this time. We set the floor, as risk managers, we are inherently conservative people. We'd like to guide all of you to a number we feel is pretty well baked. We will get there. And then we turn around and tell the team, we got to do much better than this. We got to beat this number. This number is in the bag. Let's do go, go, let's do better. That's what happened in fiscal '24. That is our plan for fiscal '25. Now the thing that makes us some place to work at. Lots of things change. There will be something that's going to fall out of our plan for '25 because some really cool opportunity is going to come up and we'll prioritize the opportunity and we'll park waste temporarily with whatever it is that the opportunity will take the plays off. None of that is in the guide by design. We are putting in the guide what we think we will get to with a really good degree of certainty. That's the philosophy. Michael, can probably give you a little bit more color if you want. Thanks, Reggie. Great question as always. There's a huge amount of benefits in not being tethered to a single price that was handed to you in the form of a line that flows precisely with the Fed Funds rate. The coupling is unnatural. We've always said it from the very beginning, this idea that you negotiate your credit card rate even if it's floating kind of once and for all, basically, and the merchant negotiates their acceptance rates once and for all, is bullish, like we live in the connected real-time world, why wouldn't we be negotiating these rates in real-time. And that's what we've built and that's why Affirm is successful, that's our innovation. As the rates move at large, as they go up, obviously, we end up having to pass some of the cost through as it hits us to consumers, practically, would this mean that at some point, someone who would have been approved will not be approved because the price is just not the number that we want to put. We have limits. We don't want to go above the Military Lending Act number, and that's a decision we made a long time ago and don't plan to change. As the rates come down, the very first consumer side impact will be better approval rates. Pricing is always fungible. We price things in real time. We can change it as we go. But the most exciting thing about reduction if Fed Fund Rate is we'll just have more active users. We'll have more new users. We'll have more repeat users because we'll be able to approve more people. If we're on a kind of if you look at the gaps between those cohort curves, they're pretty big, which means that we're not yet struggling, if you will, to improve those numbers. So the fact that we are driving this outsized gain just means that there's a lot of work to do like the way we think about what's going to happen to be a Affirm card, for example, right now, we're on the order of $3,000 of annual spend. The right number from my point of view is $7,500 at least and on the order of 20 million active cards. That's the target. When we get there, I don't know, but that is what I think is both possible and required for us to succeed. Are we going to get their fiscal '25? Probably not, certainly not making any promise on that front, but the leads that we're showing in these charts speak for themselves. They're big. That means there's a lot of opportunity. So we forecast what we think we'll get and that's in the guide. And we got some really cool ideas and that a lot of them are going to work. It's a good question. We do not take into account the rate curve i.e. future market expectations of funding costs into our decisioning explicitly. It does get reflected as we negotiate capital deals, the market expectation of rates does get reflected into those deals. And so it affects our average cost of funding, which, in turn, affects our decisioning. But we don't we're not looking at and saying with two rate cuts on the horizon, it will get more aggressive. Instead, we look at our current funding costs and compare them to what we need to generate to be profitable on a transaction basis. And there is an important reason why these things flow through have been on a lagged basis. A lot of the funding sources we have are not floating rate funding facilities. And so our ABS deals, for example, have fixed cost of funds. So it will take a while for the deals that we've done over the past year, year and a half to be refinanced in the next two years. So the funding costs are a bit stickier which means it doesn't flow through quite as immediately as you might think. Thank you, Dan. Give Dan full credit. He totally front-ran my gap. Surprised by apparently correctly predicting it. Nice note. So on the Apple side, I don't think they're capitulating. I think they, if anything, are saying this Buy Now Pay Later thing is huge and important and it's not a feature. It's a major thing, that is just as important as credit cards that may be I certainly think it is more important than credit cards because it's a better way. Creating a platform for companies like Affirm to deliver the product with all the bells and whistles with all the unique things that we know how to do well is a very smart strategy. I don't think it's backing out of something, it's embracing the fact that this is a complicated really, really textured set of offerings that works in different ways for different audiences. The thing that there are a couple of things that don't need the eye readily, in our business that every time I think I've explained, I find that people don't necessarily fully understand, so who knows. But to sort of repeat the thing that I do try to explain on and on. Underwriting is hard. You got to get data. You got to get it in real time. You have to verify it for both validity and accuracy and timeliness and all the good stuff. And it's a real complicated thing that we do here really well. We've been at it for 13, 14 years almost now. And that's our DNA. People talk about AI as if it happened yesterday. We've been in what used to be known as AI for a lot longer than it was a thing that people throw around as a reason to lay off their employees. So we use a lot of machine learning and we do a lot of good work there. So that's hard. And unless you're focused on it you're not going to do as well as a specialist like we can. Part two, which is to call out and give props to our intrepid sales team, there's enormous effort involved in signing up merchants because what we offer is really incremental, but it's also really complex. We're coming to them and saying, credit cards cost you a couple of points. You should give us 3.5%, 5.5%, 7.5%, major slices of your margin for transactions that we promise you will be really, really incremental. And the way we're going to make it work is not by giving consumers flat out cash back or discounts or all sort of tired credit card tricks, we're going to give them access to credit on extraordinary terms. With no APR at all or really low subsidized APR, that's going to matter to a certain consumer in a really big way. We're going to do transparently at the point of sale as they make a decision, all that's going to come together, is going to help them decide. It's going to help them get off the sidelines and buy right now and help you Mr and Mrs Merchant, drive more volume. That is something you find out once you have been in the market and realize that, hey, this is actually what makes this product so special. The ability to, in real time, transfer part of the margin the merchant is willing to invest in a transaction to the consumer in a form of benefit. Having a real time network of hundreds of thousands of merchants that do that willingly because they've measured incrementality is really powerful. And that's what we spent the last decade doing in addition to building real AI that adds up to a lot of work and people that think it's the coolest thing to work on. I think creating a platform for companies like ours to deliver that through world's most popular phone the world's most popular wallet is awesome. So I'm obviously super stoked about what's happening there, but it's most certainly an embracement if that's a word versus a walk away. Sorry, for a bit of a rant. We definitely have no shortage of ideas. Let's see. So I think I'll try to keep it short because it has a real danger of becoming a very long-winded answer and I feel like I spent that bullet on the last question. We think of our consumers in segments. We obviously I think everybody should throw away the credit card and start using Affirm more often. But different consumers we have, have fairly different financial profiles and different needs. We have catchy nicknames for all of our segments, but practically, some people need access to credit and care a lot about things like lower monthly payments and more time to pay back and the fact that we don't charge them late fees if something happens and they need a little bit more time to pay back. And then on the other side of the spectrum, there are people who say, hey, I understand time value of money. I'm a sophisticated consumer of credit and I will transact if you give me a 0% rate. And those two are not the same person. We live in different segments. And there are different products that excite those people in profoundly different ways. Affirm Card is a great platform to offer all of those promotional vehicles to every segment. So we think it's a universal product that we can bring, but you will see us in the coming weeks, brilliant months, launch more and more features within the Affirm Card footprint that speaks to different segments in fairly different ways. You'll see 0% deals available to folks that we know really respond to those. We will offer longer clients to pay to those that really need that, that is available to our merchants as a configurable set of tools. We used to talk a lot about adaptive checkout. It's sort of old news. So it doesn't even get a mention in my letter, but it's still the cornerstone of a lot of our payment delivery technology, we have new products that we launched Pay in 2, Pay in 30. We have a few more that we're going to roll out. And all of that will live to serve our merchants to sell more merchandise in the way that converts the best with each consumer segment. At some point, I think, there will be full automation for merchants to just say, hey, let me give you x dollars and just get me as much conversion as you possibly can. That's my vision for the Nirvana. A merchant spend almost like buying AdWords like here's my dollars get me some transactions. Here's my dollars get me some conversions. We're obviously not quite there yet, but that's the direction which we're headed. The underlying tools for each segment will necessarily be different and that's by design. We understand our consumer a lot better because we understand what they're buying through SKU level data, et cetera. I'll try to answer it in reverse order. So we'll be on the Apple Pay, which, by the way, not launched yet. So maybe I'll take it in the order you did ask. Not my role or right to unveil changes to our partners' product. So Apple will undoubtedly deliver beautiful experience, just given who they are will be a part of it. We're excited and proud to be and we'll all see exactly what it looks like when it rolls out, which hopefully will be reasonably soon now. On the economics part of it. So beyond Apple Pay, beyond any one major partner, we are not a wallet by design in definition. We are an ingredient brand. We are in that sense at least similar to Visa, MasterCard, Amex, et cetera, which means that we have an inherent tail conflict. When you go to a particularly wallet friendly website, you might find Affirm offer directly Affirm Card will be accepted because everyone takes Visa, you might find Apple Pay soon enough with us in it and Shop Pay because that's also available now off Shopify, at least in some retailers. And then there's Amazon Pay. And then there's Google Pay where we're also integrated and so on and on it goes. We are -- we aspire to be in every one of those channels, which means that when we compute the overall revenue less transaction cost metric we have to account for the possibility that the consumer will walk through any one of those doors. And we've been consistent in guiding to this idea that the business works really, really well between 3% and 4% when it gets over 4%, random securitization successes and time shift notwithstanding, above 4%, it's a little too rich, we shouldn't really be not investing those dollars and we're not approving enough people basically. Below 3% starts looking less attractive for us as shareholders. And so it will stay within 3% to 4% independent of the doors consumers will walk through. And that is certainly how we think about the business, when we enter any one of these giant partnerships and we've been extremely fortunate not entirely accidentally proud to call giant platforms, retailers and wallets our partners. We create systems and levers to help us navigate financial reality. We don't clearly know exactly the credit profile of the customer. We have expectations. We have hopes, but we don't know who's going to apply and precisely what approval rates we will be able to deliver et cetera. So as a result, we always structure these partnerships to make sure that in the end, it will adds up to 3% or 4%. For the winds of doubt, we do not need to be a bank to conduct our business in the way that we'd like to conduct it. So that is one of the many routes available to us, under the right circumstances, but it is not in any way a requirement, that it's not a thing we are marching towards in any particular, the day we decided we're going to become a bank, we'll tell all of you, hey, we decided we're going to go become a bank. That has not happened and that's not what we're saying. GAAP profitability is really important and momentous. I would like the record to show that it involved no contortionism. It's actually a really important thing that as a, in this very moment, I want people to understand. We didn't roll out of it and said, well, gosh, now we have to go get GAAP profitable. We've been saying for literally years and years that we are on this track to make more transactions happen. The unit economics are great. We get enough transactions. We multiply that by the margin of each transaction. It's going to exceed both the fixed and then eventually the rest of the costs in the business. And now we can see it so clearly we are unafraid to say, hey, here's what's going to happen. But it is a commentary on a natural course of the business while we invest all of our available cycles and dollars in growth managing credit and all the things that we do here. And so as much as it I put it in bold because I wanted people to know we take it seriously, we mean it. We are absolutely going to get there. We feel great about where the business is. But in no part of it is a, oh, fine we'll cave. We were always on this journey and now we see a destination. Beyond that we'll have another reveal. I don't know what it's going to be. Probably won't be returning bank, by the way, but it will be something else and something interesting, some kind of financial metric, Michael, will come up or Rob will come up with actually by the end of this year.\nMatthew O'Neill: Understood. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Yes. And I think you see the growth rate implied in the Q1 guide is obviously those things are reflective of where we've actually seen progress for initiatives that have shipped and are already contributing. And that's where we're seeing an acceleration in GMV in Q1 so far. I think the broader question around the new initiatives things like B2B and our partnership with some of the wallets. The question materiality I should clarify is little end material. So we're not trying to use any sort of strict definition here. But for us, it really need to be hundreds of millions, billion dollar type range before we start thinking about it as influencing the trajectory in a material way. And so when we look at a lot of these opportunities, they're either not yet shipped, as is the case with several of our wallet partnerships where they are not live yet. We don't think it's prudent to try to guess the timing of those in terms of their impact. We retain a lot of confidence on how big they will be eventually, but are being very mindful around setting guidance that is stuff that's live in the ground and contributing today or that we have control and direct line of sight to, as opposed to things that could take a few quarters to roll out and therefore have more uncertainty to them. And so I think whether it's the wallet partnerships or any of our international initiatives, we're confident on the size and scale of those or else we wouldn't be spending time on them. But we're communicating to you that if they do end up being material, that would actually be material upside to the outlook that we provided for the fiscal year. The only thing to add is the rate at which the rates change is very important. We saw a very quick rise in rates as rates went up, and you saw us react to those changing rates on the time line we talked about. We're very well positioned now to be reactive such that if they were to move that quickly again. I think we could move very quickly. But that's not in our assumption set. We don't believe that will happen. And I think we're talking about here a change in direction of rates more than the magnitude for the time being. And so very little change in the near-term based upon the booths that have already been priced in by the market. Yes. Good question. So again, on Q4, we did do a non-consolidated securitization. We don't do those every period. And so when we're able to do them, you do have a little bit of a chunky benefit, which pushed us slightly over the 4% range we'd like to think about as the ceiling. When you take that out, the RLTC rate in Q4 is pretty consistent with the guidance that we gave for Q1. So we think it's pretty stable sequentially. The big puts and takes are mostly related to mix of business that we are originating on the platform and the associated credit outcomes and then how we execute in the capital markets. I think the team has done a phenomenal job this past 12 months in broadening our access to really attractive capital sources and that's been done with ABS deals, be done with Ford [indiscernible] deals and we continue to think there's lots of opportunity for us to do more here. And certainly if we're able to do that, we can deliver strong margins. We are signing up for a 10 basis point expansion in the RLTC percent of GMV versus last year and we feel like that's possible because of a lot of the full year benefit of the and work that we've taken on, plus the fact that we do think we're in a very strong position with respect to the capital markets. Yes. I think the one thing that we as a leadership team are really proud about is just how quickly we made progress on operating leverage in the business. I think we had a lot of conviction of where we would get to for a long time. The pace at which we were able to get there over the past 12 months has been phenomenal, and the Q4 results, I think, are a great data point on that trajectory. And I think that we feel that continuing to expand our margins is good discipline. And with that, gives us the focus we need to actually operate better. And the things that temper that are we do have a ton of opportunity ahead of us. And so we don't want to operate at terminal margins, we do want to show progress. And I believe that the JPMorgan Conference last May, this May, I outlined that we would expect to continue to expand margins. We're signing up for 200 basis points this year and feel like we still have quite a bit of runway of margin expansion to do into the future and that would just be tempered with the opportunities that we have to invest, in particular, in continuing to expand our team. With one caveat. If the reason why rates are being cut is because we're in a perfect economic scenario then yes. But of course, I think, we're mindful of the fact that thing is probably happening in that scenario is some pressure on the labor market, which has been very, very tight, it begins to loosen. We, of course, would need to take into account that as we think about where we set approvals. So the thing that changes the mix across revenue streams is either the mix of originations and therefore the associated like loan content and then the capital strategies behind it. So as we lean a little bit more on gain on sale or get better pricing gain on sale, you see the gain on sale line go up. And equally as you have maybe higher MDR bearing loans, you'll see some increases there. I think really, it's difficult to identify, and we're not giving guidance on which line item for you to model out. But the root cause is that we made the asset more valuable. When you make the asset more valuable, you monetize it at a higher rate, and that's why we do think there's about 10 bps of more revenue, so pulling all the way down to the revenue less transaction cost part. And I would really encourage everybody to read the cohort engagement charts we have put in the letter. Everything Max mentioned is things that we're working on into the future to make it better. The stuff that's already in the ground, the products we already have out there are making great progress towards increasing engagement and it really jumps out at you when you start looking at just how much more engagement the recent cohorts have and the consistency with which the cohorts have grown in their engagement with us over time speaks to the underlying value of what we do for these consumers. And while we have a lot of confidence that we'll address more and more of their purchases over time."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Affirm Holdings Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Following the speakers' remarks, we will open the line for your questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nZane Keller: Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today and the company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them except as required by law. In addition, today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings supplement slide deck, which is available on our Investor Relations website. Hosting today's call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer. In line with our practice in prior quarters, we will begin with brief opening remarks from Max before proceeding immediately into Q&A. On that note, I will turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. Thank you for joining us today and taking interest in our journey and our mission. As you can tell, we're trying something new, a pre-market open earnings call, live from New York and our awesome remote work be damned, very well-attended office in Manhattan. We're excited to see some of you in-person later this week. But for now, as you can tell, we had another excellent quarter. It's all in our note. So let's jump straight into Q&A. Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller: Thank you, Max. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Wildhack: Good morning, guys. Maybe one on the quarter and then one bigger picture question too. But near term, the slides called out that the majority of the benefit from pricing initiatives will be realized by the end of this fiscal year. That all makes sense, but wondering if you could quantify how much the pricing initiatives have been helping volume growth in recent periods?\nMax Levchin: It's hard to quantify to be completely honest. We don't couple these measures super tightly because it's very dangerous to decide that one thing leads to the other. So we have a wider EPR range, obviously it served us well in the world of increased rates, but we still underwrite every transaction, we still decide which transaction is going to be not, et cetera. And so I would struggle to put a distinct number on it, certainly wouldn't want to make any prognostications about the future impact. Obviously, we are very keen on growing. We're still growing really well. We benefit from pricing quite nicely, but ultimately, we are in the risk measurement and management business here. And so we will first and foremost do no harm to that as we grow.\nMichael Linford: Maybe one thing I'd add, if you look at the letter, we bridge for you the year-over-year change in our revenue less transaction cost measure. And you can see that the revenue growth roughly offsets the increase in funding costs, other transaction costs and the incremental provision costs. And the real governor here for us is making sure that we post positive unit economics. And so the way to think about it is the revenue was what we did to offset the change in rates in the business, and we feel like we've done that. It allows us to be back to more business as usual.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay. Thanks. And then bigger picture, Max, you've talked a lot about unbundling the credit card. But elsewhere in the industry, you've got Capital One tying up with Discover and kind of a rebundling of the credit card. So I'd love to get your thoughts on how you think that could impact the industry more broadly? And then also if you see this kind of rebundling as a new or unique competitor to Affirm in any way?\nMax Levchin: First of all, I think that is singularly the most impactful and interesting thing that's happened in financial services probably in the last 10 years. So a huge goodness to Capital One for seeing the opportunity and executing on it like nothing but extreme respect for the leadership team there for just being having the hoots and boots to go do this. I think creating another network, given Discover's reach is especially powerful and so lots of good things to sort of -- from their point-of-view I think to do that. I think any incremental network building, whether it's open or not entirely open is a good thing for us because it just creates more plurality in a market and validates the idea, frankly with even our investors that there's still a chance to build another giant network. That's certainly the business we're trying to have here. I'm not sure the products that are intended to run on top of the newly -- whatever the name is going to be Discover Capital One network is meant to be any different from what happens currently on Visa and Mastercard. As you know, ours is fundamentally different. We look at SKU level data and integrate directly with merchants at a much richer degree of bandwidth to make sure that we can underwrite transactions and equally importantly, offer EPR subsidies to consumers to motivate purchasing. So I think the network itself is a little bit more of the same, but I do think that the actual deal is a profoundly interesting thing, certainly from a Capital One point of view.\nRobert Wildhack: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Thanks. So just coming off very strong GMV growth performance here in the quarter, obviously, well ahead of your guide, up 36%. I think the midpoint for the fourth quarter is implying more like 25%. Year-over-year comp is a little bit harder, but I think from a seasonal perspective, you might expect typically stronger quarter-over-quarter growth in GMV in Q4 than what's implied in the guide. So just wondering if there's any particular callouts or any plans to tighten underwriting or more cautious view on the consumer or just any additional color there would be great.\nMax Levchin: I'm sure Michael will have some words in a second, but let me tell you how I feel. We don't run the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis. It is just a fundamentally wrong way to look at a payments company that wants to be around 100 years from now like what are you going to do next quarter, like we're trying to grow, we're trying to make sure that we grow really well, yet carefully we take risk. But most importantly, the fact that we have a forecast to share with you or guide to share with you for next quarter has barely a little impact on our planned growth initiatives on some randomly chosen time boundary that is not measured in quarters. And so I think it's just really important to know that I certainly do not think of Q4 numbers through from a growth point of view. Like I definitely care about other numbers like risk, et cetera that's really important. But growth is measured in years and that's certainly how we think about it from a product point of view.\nMichael Linford: Yes. And then just a couple of things about the quarter. So fiscal Q4 is a seasonally stronger quarter. We see strength in categories like travel and ticketing, you see that reflected in our guide. Our guide at the high-end does imply faster year-on-year growth in Q4 of this year than we had on last year. So that's a year-on-year acceleration in growth. And of course, last year, the Q4, as you point out, was a pretty tough comp because it grew quite quickly from Q3. Some context there as we called out in our shareholder letter last year, we did have some new deals with travel merchants like Cathay Pacific and Booking.com and we had some expansion projects with merchants like Royal Caribbean. And yes we also launched the adoption of 36% APR caps in many merchants. And all those things contributed to a really strong Q4 last year making the comp quite hard. If you look at a two-year growth rate, the higher -- the high-end of our guide implies about 58% growth, which is a slight decel from Q3, but really isn't all that material.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. No, that's good. That's good color. I wanted to also ask just on Affirm Card. I think it said in the shareholder letter that the recent cohorts are actually using the product more than some of the initial cohorts. I think conceptually we might have thought that the early adopters would kind of be the heaviest users, but just curious to get your take on that, Max. And then just any thoughts you guys might have on how card GMV might trend in Q4? Thank you.\nMax Levchin: So great question. And that is definitely something that I keep a much closer eye on than even quarterly measure. This is a day-by-day, week-by-week. My last conversation before I walked into this one was with one of our card leaders right outside this room, just to give you a sense for where I spend my time. So you're totally right. It would seem to reason that early adoptions would just convert and put their card -- put our card top of their wallet and go, go, go and you should see some normalization. That has not happened. I didn't necessarily predicted that way, but the reason for it is simple. I didn't -- I didn't say one of the analysts notes said it, but it's a unique product. Every time you launch a unique product, you are teaching the market or teaching the consumer anyway a bunch of new modalities that they have not experienced yet, which is for some people full there and for some people the vision that they're trying to pursue and I hope I'm in the latter, but perhaps sometimes in a former category too, as you offer the product to the market, you get consumer feedback. And we have a million cards out there now with lots and lots of feedback and some people love it and some people have issues, which we are very attentive to. The last quarter, we launched uncountable number of tweaks and fixes to the user interface, most importantly, and just made the card more and more comprehensible and easy-to-use and easier to understand and just eliminating surprise user experiences in and. And so as we do that, we find another point, another three points of usage where people say, oh, okay, so now I get what I'm supposed to do at a gas station or now I'm supposed to do this in a restaurant. And like these are real examples, like a restaurant pay later mode is a little bit trickier because you might leave a tip. And so the number you see on your bill is not the same number, etcetera. And so as we just go and make the card smoother and smoother, we find new usage. That's why we think the usage increased. One interesting stat, we were roughly 6% pay now. Last quarter, we are closing in on 10% pay now this quarter. Still incidentally, those are not top of wallet numbers. That's still climbing, but that's a really good clip and we're going to keep growing until we get more. We think there's a lot more consumer spend to capture from the card and that's certainly what we are aiming for.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, Max.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I just have one question. With rising interest rates, I'm actually surprised to see how resilient GMV is and margins are going up. Like what is -- what is driving this resiliency? I mean, it's pretty amazing to see that. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Thank you. That's a very nice compliment. So we've said it before, I sometimes tweet about it, but I'm not sure people read my tweets, maybe a good thing. Hire for longer is okay with us. We are not super rate sensitive so long as rates move in subtle increments, 25 bps up or down just doesn't change our cost-of-capital in a dramatic way. And our resilience is not a secret. It's just the fact that the business isn't ultimately all that sensitive to minor rate movements. So I think other lending businesses behave differently. Ours has this really nice property where we are just not that rate sensitive and we are very, very comfortable operating the business at this growth at the rate that the Fed has set for us and we'll continue growing with or without rate cuts.\nDan Dolev: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Keane: Hi. Good morning. Max, just want to ask about Affirm Card. I know it was down a little bit sequentially, but it sounds like that was mostly seasonality. And just as we think about the longer picture trajectory of the card and the adoption of the card, how do you think about volume growth on Affirm Card? Just trying to get a sense of what the trajectory will look like given you probably have a pretty good idea what the pipeline looks like.\nMax Levchin: It is entirely seasonal. That's certainly the correct assumption. I think we talked about it last quarter, so should not be in any way surprised. Very happy with the clip. We're still not promoting it nearly as aggressively as we feel we could because, as I just said, we have a bunch more to do just on the user interface and product improvements. Not sure I will offer a specific shape of the curve for the card growth just now, given that it's still in this hyper growth stage. So easier to be wrong than right. But we have a huge number of things to ship there. We're still experimenting very actively with various kinds of rewards. Obviously, you want to be careful with margins, but it's a product that we're very excited about. We feel that it's just has lots and lots of room to grow. I think one sort of a good measure like we really started to just offer it widely just if you wanted to stretch it two years ago, if you wanted to sort of take it a little bit more narrowly a year ago, it's now very squarely trending towards multi-billion dollar business. So just from a pure like -- where have you been, where are you going, not sure there are any other financial services companies I can stick a finger at that launch a card product for the first time and end up in multi-billion dollars within 12 to 18 months. And so we have a lot of -- a lot of features to roll out. And I promised myself I'll never preannounce things on these calls, so I won't, but we've got some really cool stuff coming.\nMichael Linford: Yes. And the only thing I'd add, Bryan, is if you look at spend on a trailing 12-month basis to capture or to cancel out some of that seasonality, we actually saw spend per user increasing at a pretty healthy clip from Q2 to Q3. So we feel very, very good about the engagement on the product right now.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Got it. And the adjusted operating margin keeps kind of beating expectations. And I think in the fourth quarter, we're guiding of 15% to 17%. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the margin? And is that a good jumping-off point as we go into next year? Or are there some other puts and takes to think about?\nMichael Linford: It's a great question. Yes, I think this year has been a real year where we've been able to drive a pretty meaningful operating leverage in the business. That's a -- it's a function of us really driving strong growth in our unit economics with the revenue less transaction costs growing very quickly and are flat or even reducing fixed operating expenses. And so we would expect some of those trends to play out. However, we do still feel very optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us. So there's lots of exciting things that we're working on that will need resources. And so we definitely not want folks to think that we're going to be much above our framework that we gave investors in November. We think we continue to have revenue growth rate numbers that are well-above our 20% threshold that we put out there in November and would expect us to live within the operating -- adjusted operating income framework that we put out in November.\nBryan Keane: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Good morning. Thanks for doing this this morning. I appreciate the call out on increasing exposure given the credit performance and the yields that you're generating right now, which seems like could create some potential for near-term delinquency increases. But I'm wondering, is there a framework of how we should be thinking about GMV versus credit right now? It seems like if we look at the 30-day plus DQs on some of your prior deals that there's still a fair ways to go to higher watermarks. So just -- how should we think about that balance of driving volume growth versus where some of these other delinquency measures and credit measures may move?\nMax Levchin: Good question. Thank you, James. So what I meant in my note is that we are over-earning, as Michael would put it, which means that we have capital to invest in growth. That does not necessarily mean loosening. In fact, summer in particular is a seasonally high delinquency rate time. And so there'll be undoubtedly seasonal fluctuations in delinquencies, more likely up than down. We're very, very concerned with delinquencies at any given time just because that's single most important part of the job here. But having a little extra money on-hand to invest doesn't always mean, so let's take a little bit more risk. What it does mean, for example, that, but also you could invest that in APR subsidies, which go towards the higher credit quality borrowers and create positive selection bias in the credit portfolio. And so we'll definitely reinvest the extra gains. We'll still maintain an extremely vigilant watch over credit. As we've always said and we'll continue to say and behave, we don't use credit as a growth driver or limiter. Credit is a thing we manage entirely discretely. There's not a conversation about, well, if we just tighten a little bit, the growth will slow down. We don't want that. We want growth as much as we can responsibly handle, but not before we have credit results that we like and most importantly, our capital markets partners like. And so we'll look at that and we'll manage that entirely separately and we'll find all the intelligent ways that we can possibly grow. And I don't think we're supposed to offer a framework for that, but I just want to double stress that there's no coupling there and there should not be coupling there.\nJames Faucette: Great. That's great answer there, Max. And then I wanted to ask a follow up on the Affirm Card and clearly a lot of work going into the user interface and points where you can reduce friction. In previous comments, you've talked about some of the things that you're doing on the customer service side and I think have also called out even using AI assistance to help improve those customer support costs. I just want to hear from you where we're at on that process and you kind of what are the additional things that can be done to bring down cost of support versus reducing upfront usage friction and where you feel like you're out on that process.\nMax Levchin: Great complex question to spend the next 30 minutes diving into all that stuff. That's what I like talking about. So on the card, I think I mentioned this before, so it shouldn't come as a surprise, but we have a whole -- we think of these things in work streams. So we have a work stream called SUEX, surprise user experience. And the card is a new product, as I've mentioned just now, and there's plenty of surprises that we do not want our consumers to have with the carton. So we've been very, very busy just polishing the rough edges. And that's a long list. And if you use the card, you will see what we've done there. It's -- some of it is very apparent and some of it is a little bit more sophisticated, but just to give you like a glimpse into this, because the card sometimes runs over Visa rails sometimes runs over our own, there are situations where you have to match a transaction or somebody, for example, wants a partial refund, et cetera. And so just a logic around transaction matching going back sometimes 30 days, et cetera is fairly complicated. And the more intelligent you are in transaction matching, the better you can serve somebody, somebody who calls your caps with you and saying, hey, this transaction, I have to cancel it, showed up not as described. I have a chargeback, whatever. If you know exactly what it is, the call will go faster and the consumer will be happier. And so that sounds like a small thing, but it's a major cost reducer, for example. And there's like three dozen more where they came from. On the Al side of things, because I'm always terrified of sounding like too much of a nerd, because I am, we try to make sure our Al strategy is technology that is real versus PR, which is what we're encountering a lot in industry right now or at least pure PR. And so we've been, generally speaking, fairly quiet and dismissive about it. But we've been investing really heavily in this idea that most -- certainly, GenZ consumers really love chatting versus calling and they have no problem chatting with an Al, especially if the Al is intelligent. There's lots and lots of really complex things. One is, obviously, everybody sort of knows hallucination is a thing in Al, and you have to be very careful. But there's a bunch of really smart solutions that people in the industry have come up with, us including, where hallucination is not a problem, and we can very, very quickly satisfy a query certainly around a question of what do you do or what's your policy or what do I do as a consumer, if I have an issue or a problem, et cetera. And that's been working really, really well. And the -- it's very early, like we expect to do a lot more there. No one has yet to lose their job to be replaced by robot at a firm. So that's not a short-term cost saving. But in terms of our ability to scale our customer service and base as we employ Al more and more, that's certainly going to be a saving over the next one, two, three years. We expect for consumers to always be able to reach a human. I think that's really important. But by the time they get to a human, they want to hear someone who's an expert, who has a really deep understanding of what's happening with that particular account, that transaction, whatever dispute or questions they may have. And you can prework a lot of that with Al. And so that's where we're spending a lot of our cycles and super excited about that. Again, we try to not talk too much about it because it's just the cacophony of everybody being Al-powered is a little too loud right now. But it's a really exciting tech, and we're super thrilled to have deployed it.\nJames Faucette: Thanks for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Reginald Smith with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nReginald Smith: Hey, good morning and congrats on the quarter. I had two questions. The first, and I'm not sure if you guys have disclosed this, but I was curious if there's a way to talk about like where you're seeing your Affirm Card or the type of customers you're resonating within your base, so thinking about income or credit band. Is there a way to kind of talk about that? Were you seeing traction in particular in any given segment? And then I have a follow-up question. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Two questions. Obviously, this is essentially a transaction card or a transactor card for a habitual revolver. I think that's probably the best way to describe the near perfect product market fit with the card. We have all the expectations and designs to do to address many other bands of credit. But the idea of someone saying, I don't want to be in debt in a way that I can't predict. I like the ability to finance some things and to not finance others very explicitly, that is the purpose of the card. That's the marketing message. That's the story we tell to our consumers when they say, why do I need a have the card? And so that is the user. The user says, hey, some things need to be paid over time and some things need to be paid for right now. And I don't want to commingle the two. I'm not going to pay interest on a cup of coffee. That is the buyer. And that's what we have today, and you can see it in all the stats.\nReginald Smith: Okay. That's helpful. And then thinking about you guys break out quarterly the number of kind of new transactors, you also give like a mix of volume. I was curious, and my guess is that it probably doesn't track your volume mix. But if you were to think about where your new customers have come in, whether it's paying for core zero or installment, what's that mix? And then the second piece of that question is, in cases or instances where you're not the only BNPL solution on a website, how does that impact, I guess, new user adoption? Is there any slippage in your impact from being, I guess, the exclusive of BNPL provider on certain platforms in terms of acquiring new customers, if that makes sense.\nMax Levchin: Yes. It's a good question, a lot of depth to this. I'll start my guess as Michael will have some stats that he is willing to share, maybe not. In terms of exclusivity versus not, we don't need exclusivity to win. We are very, very comfortable being right alongside other BNPL providers because we offer products that are quite unique. And so wherever adaptive checkout shows up, that is, generally speaking, what that particular customer base needs and so our ability to predict what might be best for that user is really good and et cetera, et cetera. We also have underwritten 50 million people in the United States alone. So the brand speaks for itself. We are unique or mostly unique at this point, which is actually to the good that we don't charge late fees, we don't compound interest. We don't have deferred interest, et cetera. And so our customer knows who we are, they seek us out. And even the ones that don't have an Affirm account yet, there's now a meaning to what Affirm stands for. And I think it took a long time to persuade the market that we really are not lying or not kidding when we're saying there are no hidden fees, but it seems to be working at this point. And so in terms of exclusivity, not a hugely important thing. I'm confident that people who love their brand x competing product probably go through that door. So I'm sure we are not alone in the feeling of our users love us, but our users do seem to love us. And if you read my letter, I have a little bit of a dramatic story from a recent store trip where this woman was just -- we couldn't have scripted it better. She was gushing about us and comparing us to all the competitors saying, oh, my god. You're so much better than everybody else and like so you're very familiar with the market and you've made a choice. So I think from sort of anecdotally and in the numbers, we don't suffer from being side by side with anybody. I don't know if Michael has anything to add on the specifics of where we pick up the new users?\nMichael Linford: No. I think it definitely tracks where we currently have distribution in the products that we have distributed there. Every time we're shown on a product display page, every time we're seeing a checkout, it's a chance to acquire a user, but it also a chance to reengage new users. The only thing I would add is that it is the case that when we are launched side-by-side, maybe as a second or third BNPL product on an existing merchant site, we do see higher repeat rates there. And I think that's the power of our network on display. And oftentimes, merchants really quickly understand that adding us is incremental because of that.\nMax Levchin: Yes. Actually, one other thing that I should have said earlier, one of the niceties of being as large as we are, is our ability to sort of barge into some of the checkouts that used to be exclusive property of another player and say, hey, we're not telling you what to do, but we do have 50 million people, we've underwritten that at least a large percentage of really, really like this, you probably should add us alongside the competitor. And I've said it before and I'll say it again, the first fundraising deck that I've ever put together for this company, featured a mockup obviously, of a convenience store door that showed Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Affirm, sort of the ultimate goal of this company is to be a brand that everybody just expects in a grocery store door. We're starting to get there. We're not quite there yet, and I don't know if we're going to be there, certainly not next quarter, just if we go back to the, we don't run the business by quarters thing. But that is the future we're trying to get to. And we're now in a place where merchants say, well, yes, I probably should add you guys because there's a lot of people who want to use Affirm.\nReginald Smith: No, that makes sense, and I appreciate that. The reason I ask is, obviously, you've got a lot of questions about Walmart and then introducing their own thing. And I think it's good to hear how you guys compete or just how viable the product is even with a competing brand a button. So I appreciate the color there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Hecht: Good morning and thanks very much for taking my questions. Just looking at AOV. Now I know AOV has been really impacted over the last several quarters by kind of a mix shift from some of the larger transaction partners that you've had. But I'm wondering what you're seeing at the point of sale now and if you're seeing any trends for what users are using to buy now pay later for now relative to where in recent quarters and what that tells you about usage in the future?\nMax Levchin: I'm going to disappoint you on this one. I don't know if I have any observations to offer. It's important to note that those, AOV trends are pretty stable, like the ebb and flow based on where we are and outliers, if you wanted to segment it, which we obviously do, you'd see it correlate to things like who launched what 0% sale and what new something is being sold where. And so it's a bit of a -- it's a ratio to compute, but it's not a -- it's not a metric that is profound to our business. Obviously, generally speaking, I think, AOVs trending down -- somewhat down is a good thing, that suggests that people are using us for more and more things that look like daily purchases. Obviously, with Affirm Card, we would want the AOV to be approaching your typical debit transaction. That's sort of the most, I think, I have to say.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess maybe product mix, is there anything going on there that's evolving over the recent quarters that gives you a sense of changing customer dynamics?\nMichael Linford: No, not really. I think we continue to have a lot of ambition to serve as many transactions as possible. I think clearly, we have a strong position in the higher average order value, more considered purchases, the trend downward that Max is alluding to is a function of a lot of intentional effort. Some of that shows up in products like the card where we want to serve as many transaction types, including pay now. Some of that shows up in the kind of distribution that we're pursuing, which allows us to serve lower average order value, higher frequency transactions. I think the -- not a surprise that as the AOV has moderated a little bit downward, you've seen frequency rising quite steadily. And so we know that the higher, more consumer purchases are ones where we have a really strong position in and we have some continued opportunity in serving up the smallest transaction sizes.\nJohn Hecht: I appreciate that. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, Guys. Thanks for taking the question. It's Lamar on for Andrew. I have a follow-up on the Affirm card. And this one is specific to kind of like penetrating offline commerce and kind of like some of the improvements that you've been making to the card over time. Is there any update that you can provide on, I guess, specific usage as it relates to certain vertical segments? Maybe some color on where you're seeing sustained strength and then maybe increasing strength over time from a use case perspective as you continue to make these improvements?\nMax Levchin: Sure. So generally speaking, as I mentioned just now, we're seeing a steady increase in pay now, which is good. That's just that people are comprehending then product better. There are obviously three different modalities to the fully connected card, which is preplanned transaction, swipe to pay now and swipe and split later. Pay now increasing suggests that more people are connecting their accounts. They are maybe opening up for money accounts, et cetera. So that's all kind of to the good. We think that we're pretty focused on is making sure the card is really, really useful and valuable to you as a consumer in day-to-day transactions, be it groceries and gas and restaurants, et cetera. And so there's a lot of just subtle work to do there to make sure that we are very close to fire and forget type transaction device, which is what do you expect to work in a multi-line checkout, et cetera. So that's what we're working on. We are seeing -- I think I took that out of the letter, but we were trying to flash a stat on how the restaurant usage is picking up a little bit. And so these are not sort of headline changing results, but we're quite happy with the way things are trending in that domain. But again, it's just really important to understand that the card is very, very early. I know we've been talking about it for a long time. It takes a long time to invent a new type of card. It's neither credit nor debit, it takes a long time to spec it, it took us a long time to build it, it took us a long time to make sure we're comfortable with the various risk modalities that we're introducing with it. It's now going really well. We're still very early. We have a lot of room to grow and a lot of features to add. And that's probably the most important thing. Like I would just judge the card in terms of what it's doing when it's no longer in the first part of the S curve.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question this morning. As you look to roll out into more international markets, is your current funding model agnostic when it comes to operating outside the US? Do you have to find geographic-specific partners? And then I guess on top of that, what about credit performance as you roll out these markets? Is there a period where models will need to season in sort of new geographies? Or is a lot of the intelligence in your US model sort of transferable as you move into different geographies?\nMax Levchin: We'll take it in reverse order. So yes, we absolutely expect to be in a period of learning, one of our earliest venture capitalists called it pain tuition, where you put out some loan volume and you see how it pays back. Obviously, our next announced market is UK. The credit behaviors and performance there has some similarities to the United States. It's a Western democracy that's built around credit reporting, both positive and negative, the same credit bureaus work there, similar data types, data formats work there, similar regulations apply, what you can and cannot use for underwriting. And so our success in Canada, which is really good, suggests that we are able to transport the models across the border. UK will be another good test. We will be careful. We're not going to roll out $1 trillion of volume and hold our breath to see what happens. It will be gradual. But we feel very good about our ability to operate in the United Kingdom in terms of credit performance, and we'll still take the time to make sure that it's good. Beyond that, we've said nothing as to where we're going to go, but wherever we might show up next, you should expect us to -- in part of why we will never presumably guide to some huge volume growth internationally on year one is because credit takes time to take ourself out and we will never skip that step.\nMichael Linford: And then as for funding, yes, I think it will require that we localize funding. We want to do that anyway to make sure that we've got some currency matching with the local market, but also just getting through all the different funding sources, credit postures will require some localization. I think there are global synergies. The institutions we work with have a global footprint, and that really will help us, but it will require some localized funding sources as we get to launching, for example, in the UK later this year.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. Merchant additions went up nicely They've gone up nicely in prior quarters. And a quick follow-up for me. New merchant additions went up nicely this quarter, they've gone up nicely in prior quarters. Can you give us any further commentary about where you're seeing success there? Is it particular verticals, digital versus in-store? What is the driver? Or is it just a general rising tide type of situation with new merchant additions?\nMax Levchin: It's more rising tide. We sort of -- I stopped the practice of calling out a bunch of brands because I felt like I was letting people down when I didn't flash some cool name brand in the next shareholder letter. So we always have a couple, but I'm sure you can understand it takes effort and time to convince them to use their name for the shareholder letter. So I stopped. We are still chasing down great logos and adding them quite a lot. If you do some sleuthing in our app, you will probably find them through search. But frankly, where I'm most excited is everybody has a different acronym for it, but midsized businesses, businesses that have $10 million to $50 million in GMV are awesome because they are very growth-centric businesses. And when merchants grow, we grow faster. One of the things that we've noticed in, independent of economic times, independent of interest rates, independent of almost any variable when merchants have a posture to grow their GMV and they sign up for Affirm, our growth within that merchant always exceeds theirs. And that's exactly what majority of midsized merchants want to do. They want to become larger sized merchants. And so we are always looking for both direct and channel-based sales to those folks. I spend a lot of my time talking to those CEOs trying to understand what they really need? How are they thinking about their -- what are we competing a little bit for their advertising budgets as well as kind of their growth budget. And so just figuring out how they think, don't discount use Affirm offer subsidized APRs, offer 0% sales, like all of that is really, really important to us. And so that's where I spend a lot of my time. That's where the company is spending a fair amount of its time. That said, there's always some cool logo, we probably flash if they would give us permission for it.\nMichael Linford: I just want to reemphasize something Max said that's really important is in addition to our direct sales, which we continue to invest in acquiring new logos, we are also partnering now more with people who can help distribute our product for us. And that has been a really successful strategy and gain distribution in some of the pockets that are harder to get to with a small sales force that we have.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Zane Keller for closing comments.\nZane Keller: Thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thank you, Zane. Thank you for joining us today and taking interest in our journey and our mission. As you can tell, we're trying something new, a pre-market open earnings call, live from New York and our awesome remote work be damned, very well-attended office in Manhattan. We're excited to see some of you in-person later this week. But for now, as you can tell, we had another excellent quarter. It's all in our note. So let's jump straight into Q&A. Back to you, Zane. It's hard to quantify to be completely honest. We don't couple these measures super tightly because it's very dangerous to decide that one thing leads to the other. So we have a wider EPR range, obviously it served us well in the world of increased rates, but we still underwrite every transaction, we still decide which transaction is going to be not, et cetera. And so I would struggle to put a distinct number on it, certainly wouldn't want to make any prognostications about the future impact. Obviously, we are very keen on growing. We're still growing really well. We benefit from pricing quite nicely, but ultimately, we are in the risk measurement and management business here. And so we will first and foremost do no harm to that as we grow. First of all, I think that is singularly the most impactful and interesting thing that's happened in financial services probably in the last 10 years. So a huge goodness to Capital One for seeing the opportunity and executing on it like nothing but extreme respect for the leadership team there for just being having the hoots and boots to go do this. I think creating another network, given Discover's reach is especially powerful and so lots of good things to sort of -- from their point-of-view I think to do that. I think any incremental network building, whether it's open or not entirely open is a good thing for us because it just creates more plurality in a market and validates the idea, frankly with even our investors that there's still a chance to build another giant network. That's certainly the business we're trying to have here. I'm not sure the products that are intended to run on top of the newly -- whatever the name is going to be Discover Capital One network is meant to be any different from what happens currently on Visa and Mastercard. As you know, ours is fundamentally different. We look at SKU level data and integrate directly with merchants at a much richer degree of bandwidth to make sure that we can underwrite transactions and equally importantly, offer EPR subsidies to consumers to motivate purchasing. So I think the network itself is a little bit more of the same, but I do think that the actual deal is a profoundly interesting thing, certainly from a Capital One point of view. I'm sure Michael will have some words in a second, but let me tell you how I feel. We don't run the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis. It is just a fundamentally wrong way to look at a payments company that wants to be around 100 years from now like what are you going to do next quarter, like we're trying to grow, we're trying to make sure that we grow really well, yet carefully we take risk. But most importantly, the fact that we have a forecast to share with you or guide to share with you for next quarter has barely a little impact on our planned growth initiatives on some randomly chosen time boundary that is not measured in quarters. And so I think it's just really important to know that I certainly do not think of Q4 numbers through from a growth point of view. Like I definitely care about other numbers like risk, et cetera that's really important. But growth is measured in years and that's certainly how we think about it from a product point of view. So great question. And that is definitely something that I keep a much closer eye on than even quarterly measure. This is a day-by-day, week-by-week. My last conversation before I walked into this one was with one of our card leaders right outside this room, just to give you a sense for where I spend my time. So you're totally right. It would seem to reason that early adoptions would just convert and put their card -- put our card top of their wallet and go, go, go and you should see some normalization. That has not happened. I didn't necessarily predicted that way, but the reason for it is simple. I didn't -- I didn't say one of the analysts notes said it, but it's a unique product. Every time you launch a unique product, you are teaching the market or teaching the consumer anyway a bunch of new modalities that they have not experienced yet, which is for some people full there and for some people the vision that they're trying to pursue and I hope I'm in the latter, but perhaps sometimes in a former category too, as you offer the product to the market, you get consumer feedback. And we have a million cards out there now with lots and lots of feedback and some people love it and some people have issues, which we are very attentive to. The last quarter, we launched uncountable number of tweaks and fixes to the user interface, most importantly, and just made the card more and more comprehensible and easy-to-use and easier to understand and just eliminating surprise user experiences in and. And so as we do that, we find another point, another three points of usage where people say, oh, okay, so now I get what I'm supposed to do at a gas station or now I'm supposed to do this in a restaurant. And like these are real examples, like a restaurant pay later mode is a little bit trickier because you might leave a tip. And so the number you see on your bill is not the same number, etcetera. And so as we just go and make the card smoother and smoother, we find new usage. That's why we think the usage increased. One interesting stat, we were roughly 6% pay now. Last quarter, we are closing in on 10% pay now this quarter. Still incidentally, those are not top of wallet numbers. That's still climbing, but that's a really good clip and we're going to keep growing until we get more. We think there's a lot more consumer spend to capture from the card and that's certainly what we are aiming for. Thank you. That's a very nice compliment. So we've said it before, I sometimes tweet about it, but I'm not sure people read my tweets, maybe a good thing. Hire for longer is okay with us. We are not super rate sensitive so long as rates move in subtle increments, 25 bps up or down just doesn't change our cost-of-capital in a dramatic way. And our resilience is not a secret. It's just the fact that the business isn't ultimately all that sensitive to minor rate movements. So I think other lending businesses behave differently. Ours has this really nice property where we are just not that rate sensitive and we are very, very comfortable operating the business at this growth at the rate that the Fed has set for us and we'll continue growing with or without rate cuts. It is entirely seasonal. That's certainly the correct assumption. I think we talked about it last quarter, so should not be in any way surprised. Very happy with the clip. We're still not promoting it nearly as aggressively as we feel we could because, as I just said, we have a bunch more to do just on the user interface and product improvements. Not sure I will offer a specific shape of the curve for the card growth just now, given that it's still in this hyper growth stage. So easier to be wrong than right. But we have a huge number of things to ship there. We're still experimenting very actively with various kinds of rewards. Obviously, you want to be careful with margins, but it's a product that we're very excited about. We feel that it's just has lots and lots of room to grow. I think one sort of a good measure like we really started to just offer it widely just if you wanted to stretch it two years ago, if you wanted to sort of take it a little bit more narrowly a year ago, it's now very squarely trending towards multi-billion dollar business. So just from a pure like -- where have you been, where are you going, not sure there are any other financial services companies I can stick a finger at that launch a card product for the first time and end up in multi-billion dollars within 12 to 18 months. And so we have a lot of -- a lot of features to roll out. And I promised myself I'll never preannounce things on these calls, so I won't, but we've got some really cool stuff coming. Good question. Thank you, James. So what I meant in my note is that we are over-earning, as Michael would put it, which means that we have capital to invest in growth. That does not necessarily mean loosening. In fact, summer in particular is a seasonally high delinquency rate time. And so there'll be undoubtedly seasonal fluctuations in delinquencies, more likely up than down. We're very, very concerned with delinquencies at any given time just because that's single most important part of the job here. But having a little extra money on-hand to invest doesn't always mean, so let's take a little bit more risk. What it does mean, for example, that, but also you could invest that in APR subsidies, which go towards the higher credit quality borrowers and create positive selection bias in the credit portfolio. And so we'll definitely reinvest the extra gains. We'll still maintain an extremely vigilant watch over credit. As we've always said and we'll continue to say and behave, we don't use credit as a growth driver or limiter. Credit is a thing we manage entirely discretely. There's not a conversation about, well, if we just tighten a little bit, the growth will slow down. We don't want that. We want growth as much as we can responsibly handle, but not before we have credit results that we like and most importantly, our capital markets partners like. And so we'll look at that and we'll manage that entirely separately and we'll find all the intelligent ways that we can possibly grow. And I don't think we're supposed to offer a framework for that, but I just want to double stress that there's no coupling there and there should not be coupling there. Great complex question to spend the next 30 minutes diving into all that stuff. That's what I like talking about. So on the card, I think I mentioned this before, so it shouldn't come as a surprise, but we have a whole -- we think of these things in work streams. So we have a work stream called SUEX, surprise user experience. And the card is a new product, as I've mentioned just now, and there's plenty of surprises that we do not want our consumers to have with the carton. So we've been very, very busy just polishing the rough edges. And that's a long list. And if you use the card, you will see what we've done there. It's -- some of it is very apparent and some of it is a little bit more sophisticated, but just to give you like a glimpse into this, because the card sometimes runs over Visa rails sometimes runs over our own, there are situations where you have to match a transaction or somebody, for example, wants a partial refund, et cetera. And so just a logic around transaction matching going back sometimes 30 days, et cetera is fairly complicated. And the more intelligent you are in transaction matching, the better you can serve somebody, somebody who calls your caps with you and saying, hey, this transaction, I have to cancel it, showed up not as described. I have a chargeback, whatever. If you know exactly what it is, the call will go faster and the consumer will be happier. And so that sounds like a small thing, but it's a major cost reducer, for example. And there's like three dozen more where they came from. On the Al side of things, because I'm always terrified of sounding like too much of a nerd, because I am, we try to make sure our Al strategy is technology that is real versus PR, which is what we're encountering a lot in industry right now or at least pure PR. And so we've been, generally speaking, fairly quiet and dismissive about it. But we've been investing really heavily in this idea that most -- certainly, GenZ consumers really love chatting versus calling and they have no problem chatting with an Al, especially if the Al is intelligent. There's lots and lots of really complex things. One is, obviously, everybody sort of knows hallucination is a thing in Al, and you have to be very careful. But there's a bunch of really smart solutions that people in the industry have come up with, us including, where hallucination is not a problem, and we can very, very quickly satisfy a query certainly around a question of what do you do or what's your policy or what do I do as a consumer, if I have an issue or a problem, et cetera. And that's been working really, really well. And the -- it's very early, like we expect to do a lot more there. No one has yet to lose their job to be replaced by robot at a firm. So that's not a short-term cost saving. But in terms of our ability to scale our customer service and base as we employ Al more and more, that's certainly going to be a saving over the next one, two, three years. We expect for consumers to always be able to reach a human. I think that's really important. But by the time they get to a human, they want to hear someone who's an expert, who has a really deep understanding of what's happening with that particular account, that transaction, whatever dispute or questions they may have. And you can prework a lot of that with Al. And so that's where we're spending a lot of our cycles and super excited about that. Again, we try to not talk too much about it because it's just the cacophony of everybody being Al-powered is a little too loud right now. But it's a really exciting tech, and we're super thrilled to have deployed it. Two questions. Obviously, this is essentially a transaction card or a transactor card for a habitual revolver. I think that's probably the best way to describe the near perfect product market fit with the card. We have all the expectations and designs to do to address many other bands of credit. But the idea of someone saying, I don't want to be in debt in a way that I can't predict. I like the ability to finance some things and to not finance others very explicitly, that is the purpose of the card. That's the marketing message. That's the story we tell to our consumers when they say, why do I need a have the card? And so that is the user. The user says, hey, some things need to be paid over time and some things need to be paid for right now. And I don't want to commingle the two. I'm not going to pay interest on a cup of coffee. That is the buyer. And that's what we have today, and you can see it in all the stats. Yes. It's a good question, a lot of depth to this. I'll start my guess as Michael will have some stats that he is willing to share, maybe not. In terms of exclusivity versus not, we don't need exclusivity to win. We are very, very comfortable being right alongside other BNPL providers because we offer products that are quite unique. And so wherever adaptive checkout shows up, that is, generally speaking, what that particular customer base needs and so our ability to predict what might be best for that user is really good and et cetera, et cetera. We also have underwritten 50 million people in the United States alone. So the brand speaks for itself. We are unique or mostly unique at this point, which is actually to the good that we don't charge late fees, we don't compound interest. We don't have deferred interest, et cetera. And so our customer knows who we are, they seek us out. And even the ones that don't have an Affirm account yet, there's now a meaning to what Affirm stands for. And I think it took a long time to persuade the market that we really are not lying or not kidding when we're saying there are no hidden fees, but it seems to be working at this point. And so in terms of exclusivity, not a hugely important thing. I'm confident that people who love their brand x competing product probably go through that door. So I'm sure we are not alone in the feeling of our users love us, but our users do seem to love us. And if you read my letter, I have a little bit of a dramatic story from a recent store trip where this woman was just -- we couldn't have scripted it better. She was gushing about us and comparing us to all the competitors saying, oh, my god. You're so much better than everybody else and like so you're very familiar with the market and you've made a choice. So I think from sort of anecdotally and in the numbers, we don't suffer from being side by side with anybody. I don't know if Michael has anything to add on the specifics of where we pick up the new users? Yes. Actually, one other thing that I should have said earlier, one of the niceties of being as large as we are, is our ability to sort of barge into some of the checkouts that used to be exclusive property of another player and say, hey, we're not telling you what to do, but we do have 50 million people, we've underwritten that at least a large percentage of really, really like this, you probably should add us alongside the competitor. And I've said it before and I'll say it again, the first fundraising deck that I've ever put together for this company, featured a mockup obviously, of a convenience store door that showed Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Affirm, sort of the ultimate goal of this company is to be a brand that everybody just expects in a grocery store door. We're starting to get there. We're not quite there yet, and I don't know if we're going to be there, certainly not next quarter, just if we go back to the, we don't run the business by quarters thing. But that is the future we're trying to get to. And we're now in a place where merchants say, well, yes, I probably should add you guys because there's a lot of people who want to use Affirm. I'm going to disappoint you on this one. I don't know if I have any observations to offer. It's important to note that those, AOV trends are pretty stable, like the ebb and flow based on where we are and outliers, if you wanted to segment it, which we obviously do, you'd see it correlate to things like who launched what 0% sale and what new something is being sold where. And so it's a bit of a -- it's a ratio to compute, but it's not a -- it's not a metric that is profound to our business. Obviously, generally speaking, I think, AOVs trending down -- somewhat down is a good thing, that suggests that people are using us for more and more things that look like daily purchases. Obviously, with Affirm Card, we would want the AOV to be approaching your typical debit transaction. That's sort of the most, I think, I have to say. Sure. So generally speaking, as I mentioned just now, we're seeing a steady increase in pay now, which is good. That's just that people are comprehending then product better. There are obviously three different modalities to the fully connected card, which is preplanned transaction, swipe to pay now and swipe and split later. Pay now increasing suggests that more people are connecting their accounts. They are maybe opening up for money accounts, et cetera. So that's all kind of to the good. We think that we're pretty focused on is making sure the card is really, really useful and valuable to you as a consumer in day-to-day transactions, be it groceries and gas and restaurants, et cetera. And so there's a lot of just subtle work to do there to make sure that we are very close to fire and forget type transaction device, which is what do you expect to work in a multi-line checkout, et cetera. So that's what we're working on. We are seeing -- I think I took that out of the letter, but we were trying to flash a stat on how the restaurant usage is picking up a little bit. And so these are not sort of headline changing results, but we're quite happy with the way things are trending in that domain. But again, it's just really important to understand that the card is very, very early. I know we've been talking about it for a long time. It takes a long time to invent a new type of card. It's neither credit nor debit, it takes a long time to spec it, it took us a long time to build it, it took us a long time to make sure we're comfortable with the various risk modalities that we're introducing with it. It's now going really well. We're still very early. We have a lot of room to grow and a lot of features to add. And that's probably the most important thing. Like I would just judge the card in terms of what it's doing when it's no longer in the first part of the S curve. We'll take it in reverse order. So yes, we absolutely expect to be in a period of learning, one of our earliest venture capitalists called it pain tuition, where you put out some loan volume and you see how it pays back. Obviously, our next announced market is UK. The credit behaviors and performance there has some similarities to the United States. It's a Western democracy that's built around credit reporting, both positive and negative, the same credit bureaus work there, similar data types, data formats work there, similar regulations apply, what you can and cannot use for underwriting. And so our success in Canada, which is really good, suggests that we are able to transport the models across the border. UK will be another good test. We will be careful. We're not going to roll out $1 trillion of volume and hold our breath to see what happens. It will be gradual. But we feel very good about our ability to operate in the United Kingdom in terms of credit performance, and we'll still take the time to make sure that it's good. Beyond that, we've said nothing as to where we're going to go, but wherever we might show up next, you should expect us to -- in part of why we will never presumably guide to some huge volume growth internationally on year one is because credit takes time to take ourself out and we will never skip that step. It's more rising tide. We sort of -- I stopped the practice of calling out a bunch of brands because I felt like I was letting people down when I didn't flash some cool name brand in the next shareholder letter. So we always have a couple, but I'm sure you can understand it takes effort and time to convince them to use their name for the shareholder letter. So I stopped. We are still chasing down great logos and adding them quite a lot. If you do some sleuthing in our app, you will probably find them through search. But frankly, where I'm most excited is everybody has a different acronym for it, but midsized businesses, businesses that have $10 million to $50 million in GMV are awesome because they are very growth-centric businesses. And when merchants grow, we grow faster. One of the things that we've noticed in, independent of economic times, independent of interest rates, independent of almost any variable when merchants have a posture to grow their GMV and they sign up for Affirm, our growth within that merchant always exceeds theirs. And that's exactly what majority of midsized merchants want to do. They want to become larger sized merchants. And so we are always looking for both direct and channel-based sales to those folks. I spend a lot of my time talking to those CEOs trying to understand what they really need? How are they thinking about their -- what are we competing a little bit for their advertising budgets as well as kind of their growth budget. And so just figuring out how they think, don't discount use Affirm offer subsidized APRs, offer 0% sales, like all of that is really, really important to us. And so that's where I spend a lot of my time. That's where the company is spending a fair amount of its time. That said, there's always some cool logo, we probably flash if they would give us permission for it."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Maybe one thing I'd add, if you look at the letter, we bridge for you the year-over-year change in our revenue less transaction cost measure. And you can see that the revenue growth roughly offsets the increase in funding costs, other transaction costs and the incremental provision costs. And the real governor here for us is making sure that we post positive unit economics. And so the way to think about it is the revenue was what we did to offset the change in rates in the business, and we feel like we've done that. It allows us to be back to more business as usual. Yes. And then just a couple of things about the quarter. So fiscal Q4 is a seasonally stronger quarter. We see strength in categories like travel and ticketing, you see that reflected in our guide. Our guide at the high-end does imply faster year-on-year growth in Q4 of this year than we had on last year. So that's a year-on-year acceleration in growth. And of course, last year, the Q4, as you point out, was a pretty tough comp because it grew quite quickly from Q3. Some context there as we called out in our shareholder letter last year, we did have some new deals with travel merchants like Cathay Pacific and Booking.com and we had some expansion projects with merchants like Royal Caribbean. And yes we also launched the adoption of 36% APR caps in many merchants. And all those things contributed to a really strong Q4 last year making the comp quite hard. If you look at a two-year growth rate, the higher -- the high-end of our guide implies about 58% growth, which is a slight decel from Q3, but really isn't all that material. Yes. And the only thing I'd add, Bryan, is if you look at spend on a trailing 12-month basis to capture or to cancel out some of that seasonality, we actually saw spend per user increasing at a pretty healthy clip from Q2 to Q3. So we feel very, very good about the engagement on the product right now. It's a great question. Yes, I think this year has been a real year where we've been able to drive a pretty meaningful operating leverage in the business. That's a -- it's a function of us really driving strong growth in our unit economics with the revenue less transaction costs growing very quickly and are flat or even reducing fixed operating expenses. And so we would expect some of those trends to play out. However, we do still feel very optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us. So there's lots of exciting things that we're working on that will need resources. And so we definitely not want folks to think that we're going to be much above our framework that we gave investors in November. We think we continue to have revenue growth rate numbers that are well-above our 20% threshold that we put out there in November and would expect us to live within the operating -- adjusted operating income framework that we put out in November. No. I think it definitely tracks where we currently have distribution in the products that we have distributed there. Every time we're shown on a product display page, every time we're seeing a checkout, it's a chance to acquire a user, but it also a chance to reengage new users. The only thing I would add is that it is the case that when we are launched side-by-side, maybe as a second or third BNPL product on an existing merchant site, we do see higher repeat rates there. And I think that's the power of our network on display. And oftentimes, merchants really quickly understand that adding us is incremental because of that. No, not really. I think we continue to have a lot of ambition to serve as many transactions as possible. I think clearly, we have a strong position in the higher average order value, more considered purchases, the trend downward that Max is alluding to is a function of a lot of intentional effort. Some of that shows up in products like the card where we want to serve as many transaction types, including pay now. Some of that shows up in the kind of distribution that we're pursuing, which allows us to serve lower average order value, higher frequency transactions. I think the -- not a surprise that as the AOV has moderated a little bit downward, you've seen frequency rising quite steadily. And so we know that the higher, more consumer purchases are ones where we have a really strong position in and we have some continued opportunity in serving up the smallest transaction sizes. And then as for funding, yes, I think it will require that we localize funding. We want to do that anyway to make sure that we've got some currency matching with the local market, but also just getting through all the different funding sources, credit postures will require some localization. I think there are global synergies. The institutions we work with have a global footprint, and that really will help us, but it will require some localized funding sources as we get to launching, for example, in the UK later this year. I just want to reemphasize something Max said that's really important is in addition to our direct sales, which we continue to invest in acquiring new logos, we are also partnering now more with people who can help distribute our product for us. And that has been a really successful strategy and gain distribution in some of the pockets that are harder to get to with a small sales force that we have."

Following the speakers' remarks, we will open the lines for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nZane Keller: Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them, except as required by law. In addition, today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings supplement slide deck which is available on our Investor Relations website. Hosting today's call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, a firm's Chief Financial Officer. In line with our practice in prior quarters, we will begin with brief opening remarks from Max before proceeding immediately into questions and answers. On that note, I will turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. Thank you all for joining us today. We're excited to share the results of another great quarter. As is our custom, the better the results, the fewer words we used to comment on them. This time around, I feel good enough to go directly to the Q&A. Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller: Thank you, Max. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question this evening. I was wondering, if you could help us think through RLTC for the remaining two quarters of the year. Sort of what are the drivers, puts and takes, variables that could impact our RLTC and drive underperformance or outperformance. How should we think about those kind of variables?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. I think, obviously, if you're thinking in terms of percentage of GMV, there's a number of factors, mix and macro at the top of the list. If you're thinking about total dollars then GMV on the platform was going to be the biggest driver of results there. In terms of the RLTC rate, the take rate on a percentage of GMV, it's really mix and macro. So the mix of business across our merchant base and the products that we offer there. And from a macro perspective, everything going on with consumers and rates would be there. We really like the environment we're in right now. That's why we've updated our full year guidance like we have. And so we feel good about the back half of the year. RLTC margins as a percentage of GMV and feel good about that because of the macro environment that we're in. And we -- as per the usual, we take the current macro signals current levels of unemployment, current forward curve and bake goes into our assumptions. But obviously, there are scenarios where those could move one way or the other, that would change the outcome for us.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And a follow-up for me. On Slide 10, where you list out your GMV vertical mix, it looks like general merchandise has picked up quite a bit from travel and ticketing or travel and ticketing has gone down and general merchandise gone up. Are there any drivers to call out there? And I guess, more broadly, can you just comment on performance across key verticals in there?\nMichael Linford: So travel and ticketing is a very seasonal category. So a lot of folks book summer vacation travel in the first two calendar quarters, last two fiscal quarters, of our year, and it tends to be lowest in terms of bookings in calendar quarters like Q2. And so we think there's a huge seasonality factor there. And for general merchandise, some of our largest merchant enterprise partners fall in that bucket. And as we continue to scale those, we will see lots of purchases there, and it's not unusual for that to be a category that spikes in and around holiday season has a lot of holiday shopping is done in those channels.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Makes perfect sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Appreciate you taking the question. Max, brevity is indeed the sister of talent, I'll make that very clear. So I've got a couple of questions just on GMV growth and tender share. As I recall, you've tightened the credit box about a year ago, and obviously, the back half of the fiscal year looks strong. Can you comment either Max or Michael, just on kind of how underwriting and risk are factoring into that strength? And then the corollary, I guess, or the follow-on would be around tender share of your enterprise customers, and it appeared to be elevated during the holidays, and I just wonder if that's a sign of accelerating tender share to come or aspirational end or share growth?\nMax Levchin: Appreciate the comments, first of all. The underwriting settings, so the single most I would say, accelerated change we've conducted to our, as we call it, Box, it was really more a 1.5 years ago than a year ago. April of '22 is when we saw real stress on the consumer, and we reacted to that sort of within the next 60 days or so. We've since really not done an enormous amount of significant steering. We changed marginal cutoffs on a merchant-by-merchant category by category, product by product basis all the time and also change things like allowed terms as durations required down payments, etc. So we managed credit very, very actively since sort of the beginning of time for us but there's not been a major change to our posture in the last 1.5 years. The numbers that we printed just now are not an accident. We drove them to be what they are very, very deliberately. And I don't want anybody to sort of assume that we're hands off and the numbers just print themselves. It's a lot of work, and we care quite a lot where they end up. We have certain expectations we set with capital markets, and we intend to continue delivering those expectations. And so that's first and foremost. And that governs a lot of our metrics that put to that. The tender share -- share of wallet as we go on internally has done really well over the holidays. We've generally been gaining wallet share, although the stories are different category. And in some cases, merchant to merchant. Feel very good about some of the things that we announced. Obviously, offline. We were not a noticeable player until recently in between the card and some of the online -- offline self-checkout kiosks really powerful. And then just sort of call out one, particularly strong performance over the holidays, especially and overall in the last quarter, Shopify has just continued to perform extraordinarily. The growth of that particular partnership is accelerating three plus years into the partnership. That set of products grew about twice the speed of the rest of Affirm. And so it's just been a story of success to success. And we still have a lot of things that we have not scaled out. They have their own offline aspirations that we're obviously very excited to be a part of, etc. And so it's a little bit of a -- and I'm giving a very long-winded answer here, but frequency for us is being where consumer shops. And share of tender comes as a consequence of being available and being able to support the various consumer needs that as we encounter them.\nMichael Linford: And the only thing I'd add is we did with the 36% APR cap that we were able to get in place, we were able to be more expansionary in a number of places that is completely done now. And so we wouldn't expect any more volume benefit there, although there is still some margin benefit, we think that will come as the program continues to roll out and scale but we wouldn't expect any more volume there because of 36%.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nReginald Smith: Good afternoon and congrats on the quarter. I guess you kept your comments short. But I guess where were you most surprised and this is a pretty big beat. And then I had a follow-up after that.\nMax Levchin: We try to run a tight ship, so surprises are rarely a welcome thing and if they are to the good. I think, I already called that out, but I thought Shopify as a company, years to have done a fantastic job with their products, and we stand to support our partners there and have done it all together. Let's see what other surprises. Don't like surprises, Reggie. I feel like, anytime somebody surprise me, I'm not going to like the outcome. Actually, I'll give you one very surprising fact, which is a little bit of an inside view, but we had very noticeably accelerated our ability to ship software and I had anticipated some of that, but I'm quite surprised about how productive the teams have been on the engineering side, on the product side and design side, sort of percolates down to revenue. So generally speaking, I expected that we would rally around the goals, especially from sort of the low point of this time last year. But the if it's a turnaround, it's a much faster and more aggressive turnaround than I expected.\nReginald Smith: Got it. And then just looking at the seasonal patterns of your margins, the back half of the year tends to be better than the front half of the year. And when I look at your full year guidance for your operating margin, I guess it implies in the third quarter, I think it implies a pretty sequential increase in and expenses below the RLTC line? Like, what's driving that and kind of where should we see that show up? Is it a marketing thing? Is it technology? My rough math was almost like $20 million of sequential increase to -- I'm not sure if that's right or not. But if you can comment on that a little bit, that would be helpful.\nMichael Linford: Yeah. We don\u2019t provide a specific guidance number for there. So sometimes the way in which we build our guidance can lead to a little bit of exaggeration on that as you calculate it. But that\u2019s right. And there\u2019s a couple of factors to think about. Firstly, we \u2013 and this will sound very trivial, but I promise you it does actually end up becoming pretty big. We do expect there to be a lot more payroll tax associated with stock-based compensation in our first quarter, both because people have reset their tax obligations to \u2013 with the new year, but also because the share price is higher. And both those two things will create a little bit of the sequential bump from quarter-to-quarter. And then we remain really excited about the opportunities that are ahead for us. And so we\u2019re continuing to be thoughtful around where we should be adding resources to go build new products and chase the new opportunities. And I think the strength in this quarter\u2019s results with respect to our unit economics and operating efficiency, give us license to be willing to add a little operating expense, whereas I think we\u2019ve been very cautious to do that until we could demonstrate it.\nReginald Smith: Understood. Congratulations. Great quarter.\nMichael Linford: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results. Congrats, Max and Mike and the team. Quick question -- I have two questions. The first one is on the guide. Obviously, the knee-jerk reaction, which we disagree with was that the GMV guide is conservative. You beat by $700 million. You're increasing the guide by $1 billion -- and for GMV, like you sound very upbeat about the macro. Is it just conservatism?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. I mean, just like we have all year long for the full year, we're only providing a floor or our full year guide. And so we did take our floor up by $1 billion, which we think is a pretty big step up in what we would expect for the year. We remain very upbeat and excited about the opportunity. .\nDan Dolev: Got it. Yeah. No, that's what it seems like. And then maybe one other question on kind of the direct deposit opportunity. You've had tremendous success with the card. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the usage and frequency for the people that are doing the direct deposit into the card or into the Affirm app?\nMax Levchin: A little early. We gave the future name about 60-something days ago. So it's a little early to brag about the results. But we feel very good about it. It's done in the early versions that it is about as well as we could hope for. We have a lot more things coming for that product, working on a couple of very specific things that are just required before you can really call yourself an account. But feel great. It\u2019s definitely \u2013 and I think I mentioned this before, but there\u2019s kind of three stages of Affirm usage. If you are a not cardholder, non-account holder, regular user, frequencies 4.5 transactions a year and grew again 20% plus year-on-year. But if you have a card that goes up quite a lot, is about 4x, and then it grows again, fairly significantly if you are an account holder. So very excited to give more accounts to people because that\u2019s ultimately a frequency driver for us as well.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Well, it sounds like a huge opportunity. Congrats again.\nMax Levchin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Wildhack: Hey, guys. May I ask a question on volume in a different way. I think the shareholder letter called out three quarters of accelerating volume growth and then within the December quarter each month, accelerated to the updated outlook for the rest of the year seems to point to a pretty healthy slowdown in the second half, half over half. So I wanted to get your thoughts on what might be driving that slowdown if there's anything specific that you're seeing?\nMichael Linford: So again, I think the full year outlook for us is just a floor. And so we've not given even a range or a ceiling to where we'd expect any calculation being done on Q4 is probably not getting to a midpoint. And any math you're doing on that number inclusive of our Q3 range is taking -- is probably squeezing that number quite a bit. Separate from that, we had a really good Q2, right? And so the really strong second quarter isn't something that we would ever take and say that's a fundamental change of business. That's something we would take credit for, be very happy with, but we'd be pretty cautious about how we would build up the outlook for the balance of the year and want to be mindful of all of the factors that can go into that. But there's nothing in our business that would suggest that we're slowing down right now.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay. Thanks. And then your picture, and I appreciate this may not be in play for this fiscal year, but how would you expect potential interest rate cuts to flow through to funding costs? And then strategically, would you want to drop those savings to the bottom line via higher RLTC margin or do something different?\nMichael Linford: That's a great question. So whenever we think about a change in rates, we need to understand why the rates are moving. Certainly, if the rates are moving in response to other stress in the economy, specifically employment, then it's not a one-for-one benefit. But if you hold all other factors constant, then a decline in rates would help us the RLTC line. We would seek to continue to run the business in the 3% to 4% range that we've talked about really since we've gone public. And if we were able to be earning at the high end or above that, we would seek to reinvest that in products to engage and reengage -- acquire new users and reengage them.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you. So you highlighted in the shareholder letter, I think that 2/3 of the revenue growth in the quarter was from interest income. Is it fair to say that's also the revenue line item that surprised you most to the upside relative to your guidance? And just curious how much of the revenue guidance range for the fiscal year is coming from the interest income line, you guys have obviously been doing a really good job on that side of the equation.\nMichael Linford: No. Certainly, we're happy to have the unit economics we do have, but I think we're probably more surprised with the healthy merchant fee growth. Whenever merchant fees outpaced GMV growth, it creates pretty good flow through to the full P&L in a way that's outsized. I think some of the strong performance we had above our expectations around RLTC and the flow-through for the full P&L was actually driven by the really healthy merchant line. Yes, the total aggregate revenue growth wasn't there. But remember, against that, interest income growth is a pretty steep rise in funding costs, and that's driven by both the balance sheet growth as well as the higher benchmark rates that we're in this year. And in fact, interest funding costs grew faster than interest income. And so while that was important for us to be able to get the business where it is, it's also the case that -- we don't see that as the real tailwind here. We're still managing through a rate environment that's substantially lower last year than this year. And as those things abate, then we will begin to see the benefit end of the future.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. No, that makes sense. And then just like a two-part question on GMV. What's your latest expectation for Affirm card GMV this fiscal year? And then any comments you might have around January GMV trends. I'm kind of curious because we heard from others that card-present volumes suffered because of the severe weather. So just wondering if your business benefited at all from that? Thank you.\nMichael Linford: So we've not given any outlook for the card, and I won't now. What I would say in the letter, we talked briefly about the seasonality of the card, and I think this is a really important thing for everybody to pay attention to, which is the card had really strong growth from Q1 to Q2. We would estimate that about half of that growth in card volume was actually underlying seasonality and the other half was growth in the card which just means as you think through where the volume should be for the card in the balance of the year. Just keep in mind the Q2 starting point is benefited by a pretty big step up from Q1 to Q2 from seasonality as consumers do spend more in the holiday season. And we\u2019re still early enough with the card. Fortunately, we\u2019re not seeing things like weather impact our card performance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jill Shea with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJill Shea: Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide us an update on the Shopify partnership and any stats that you could share with us, that would be great. Thanks.\nMax Levchin: Hi. It's one of the highlights of this last quarter is going unbelievably strong. It accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. The program is over three years old and the fact that it's still picking up steam is just great, and they've been extraordinary partners to us and nothing but wonderful things to say about Tobi and CAS in Arlington team there, and there's just been nothing but excellent in both our execution and the partnership that we had. I think already drop that stat. But the program at Shopify grew twice the speed of the overall Affirm growth on the GMV side of things. They have aspirations off-line that they're going after quite strongly and there's still a lot of synergies and what we're doing now there. We have a whole host of programs we're contemplating going forward. So lots of with the job feeling very good. The fact that it's accelerating suggests that there's just more growth to be had for both of us.\nJill Shea: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much this afternoon, guys, for all the time. I wanted to ask on 0% promotions. It seemed like, at least anecdotally, those increase some, particularly towards the end of the December quarter. And I think in your supplement, you showed that 0% long duration merchant rates had picked up. Can you talk a little bit about like what's driving that merchant rate tick up? Is it just longer duration generally within that long group? And how should we think about that both in terms of impact on RLTC margin, but also in terms of the type of customer and that you're bringing in with those promotions? Just wondering if that's enough to move the needle on some of these other metrics.\nMichael Linford: Yeah. It's a good question. The -- as rates have gone up, any of our longer-term 0% programs have needed higher merchant fees and I really think there's really not much more to it than that. So it's the mix and tied to benchmark rates. In terms of the customers that we bring in, it does skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum when you do those kind of products. But given the high levels of repeat, it's not really going to change the average as much at Affirm. We, of course, have been, we were very active. We're meeting our merchant partners where we could in providing anything promotionally in the second quarter, and we continue to do that. But it's it didn't change an awful lot from the prior quarter in terms of the total mix. So I wouldn't -- I don't really think there's a fundamental trend there.\nJames Faucette: Got it. And then I wanted to ask, maybe it's a little bit convoluted question, but you're obviously growing the Affirm card really nicely kind of that run rate that you talked about seems to be around 100,000 cards a quarter or I'm sorry, a month. How should we think about is, a, I'm wondering how we should think about the availability or the credit pool available and how that's growing by comparison, right? Because as you send out cards, people will use it, you said most of it of that is interest bearing. So some of that available credit gets absorbed, but then there's new credit growth in that pool as you add more cards. So just how should we think about that potential to buy pool growing vis-a-vis the growth in cards. Hopefully, that question makes sense.\nMax Levchin: I'm going to try to answer, but feel free to tell me that I'm answering their own questions. So I think you're asking -- I guess, the way I'm interpreting this overall, at least try to answer is, does the card availability to consumers create new pools available transactions for us to take on? And the answer is yes. Our off-line usage with the card versus without the card is drastically different. And so all of those transactions are entirely incremental. It's not really all that magical why transactions of the cardholders are significantly higher than average transactions for non-cardholder from user, it's because these people are for, they're more committed because they requested a card. And two, they're bringing it to stores. So it's it just touches a larger open field opportunity. In terms of underwriting and sort of our exposure on the credit side, et cetera, there's no change in the sense that we -- and we talked about this before, but for the longest time, our sort of calling card in the underwriting world was this thing called ITAC, which is the internal transactional Affirm credit score. And that allowed us to do really precise underwriting at the transactional level. Some number of quarters ago, we have augmented that with a user credit score which allows us to underwrite both sort of a more holistic consumer in addition to every individual traction. We still underwrite every transaction, we still reserve the right to say we cannot lend money to you. but we have a score that we feel very good about in our ability to say what's the overall capacity to borrow and pay us back and willingness to do so. And we lend on the card and off the card using the same set of scores and the same set of variables and limits. And so you can borrow from Affirm using an integrated point-of-sale solution you can borrow on the card with two different modalities of borrowing on the card, but all of it goes against the same set of variables and the same set of observed behaviors that governs our ability to approve the next transaction. The thing that's created about the card is that it's optimized for convenience in everything like multi-land checkout environments all the way to online shopping. So it's an expansion of opportunity, but not an expansion of our willingness to take on more risk I think that answers it, but I'm happy to provide a lot more details if you like.\nMichael Linford: I think the other thing to say is I don't think we're anywhere near the limits on what we think we would think about exposure limits for these users and we're nowhere near some sort of cap there for the population. We think there's a lot of frequency that we can drive with the existing users.\nJames Faucette: Yeah. Great. Appreciate that. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Hecht: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Like, just thinking about kind of the appetite for selling versus retaining the loans that you guys generated this year, I mean, you have interest rate, at least the curve is going down. It looks like sales execution is getting better, but you guys had an ABS transaction, I think, yesterday and the execution there was good. So how do we just think about kind of balance sheet movement versus marketplace movement over the course of the year?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we did price an ABS deal, and we did so at an all-in cost of capital, 100 basis points lower than a deal we did in December. So in a very short period of time, you're seeing the market really give us credit for that. And that, we think, is a really healthy sign for the capital system and ecosystem overall. And we think is a reflection of both an improved macro outlook for everybody, but for us, more specifically, the disciplined approach to credit that we've taken over the past year is getting valued we think, in the debt capital markets. And so we feel very strong about that. When we do the revolving ABS deals like the one we just did our 248 (ph) deal, those do end up on the balance sheet. And so while we do think about that as a really important funding channel, it isn't off balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet strategies involve mostly selling whole loans, although we do some non-revolving some term securitizations. With respect to the whole loan sales, we feel really excited about both the existing partners expanding and the pipeline of new opportunities that we have. Those conversations have gone very well. I think very consistent with the reaction that the ABS market has had. There's real value being given to us for the kind of credit outcomes that we've driven. And frankly, the yield that we put into the asset has allowed us to continue to be able to sell at prices that aren't really good for us. As is always the case, and we've said since day 1, we don't have one strategy that's better than the other. The things that we do are first and foremost, enable the growth in the business, and I'm extremely proud of the way the team has been able to support the capital program over the past year through all the volatility remaining enabling all the growth that we've delivered. The second priority is to deliver our unit economics. Clearly, if we\u2019re running the 3% to 4% range like we did this past quarter, we feel very strong about that. And then we begin to want to manage the capital efficiency of the program. That\u2019s the third piece. And obviously, whole loan sales are more efficient but it\u2019s the third of the three priorities. And so we wouldn\u2019t really want to overuse that lever. And then the last comment is each of our capital strategies really exists and reinforce one another. And so you really won\u2019t see us pivot to one or the other. We\u2019re going to continue to scale all of our channels. That means continued ABS execution, continued forward flow and continued use of our warehouse lines.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. My other question was asked and answered, and I appreciate the color. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin Barker: Thanks for taking my questions. So there was a little bit of a tick up in the net charge-off rate in the quarter. It seems like you built reserves last quarter that may have preempted the charge-off coming through or could be partially seasonality as well. Is there anything to point out there? And would you expect that charge-off rate to drift lower just given you're seeing a larger portion of GMV being driven by Affirm card? Thanks.\nMichael Linford: No. I don't think the card is going to drive different credit outcomes for the whole portfolio. I think the level of repeat usage might where you do see better credit outcomes on repeat users overall, but I don't think the card is big enough really to affect the total portfolio numbers yet. Obviously, when it gets much larger, it will begin to have a more material impact. But for now, I think it's small enough and yes, there's really nothing to point to specifically on the charge-offs. Again, I think about our charge-off policy, we charge off at 120 days. Delinquencies once they get to past 60 or 90 days are overwhelmingly likely to go towards charge-offs. So we have a pretty good sense of that and full allowance at all times to handle the future charge-offs that we estimate.\nKevin Barker: I think you mentioned that you were leaning in a little bit last quarter. Are you opening up the credit box to attract more users. It seems like it's an opportune time to do that just given your acceleration here and profitability that's being generated?\nMichael Linford: Yeah. I think the strong units give us permission to do that more than anything. So we talked about 3% to 4% in the revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV. That\u2019s the real constraint for us. And so if we\u2019re in that range, we can continue to be very aggressive on acquiring and reengaging new users. And that\u2019s really the constraint much more so than anything else.\nKevin Barker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ng: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, a housekeeping question. Could you just help explain the uptick in the merchant fee rates for the long core zeros and are there any initiatives or mix dynamics that may affect that going forward? And then second, just a bigger picture question. Transactions per active have obviously been growing 4.4% this last quarter. You're also seeing really strong repeat customers. What does that tell you about the loyalty or engagement of customers and the durability about the installed base of users? Are these customers using this because it's become more habitual and it's a better experience or is it out of a necessity of credit? Thank you.\nMichael Linford: So on the first question, it really is just a function of the mix in our business. And that's always been true for merchant rates. We always talk about merchant fee rates as being mix driven. That's why we began breaking it out in the supplement. The slight tick-up you see on one of the categories is really just a function of mix within that category, but also as duration goes up, so does the price, especially in this rate environment, where it's pretty duration sensitive in terms of the price you charge. I don't -- again, I don't think there's a broader trend to be read into there. And on the frequency question, I'll let Max answer that.\nMax Levchin: I think it's a reflection of the fact that the product is becoming more widely available more than anything. I think as we sign up some of the partnerships and expand them, the Shopify reference I made earlier, it does result in wider availability. The product is popular. It's well liked by the users. One of our top questions in customer service is why isn't Brand X supporting Affirm right now, and we work very hard to make sure there are fewer and fewer of those. And so as we become more available, also as we become available offline in the form of the card as well as some of the integrations that we've done, you'll naturally see more transactional velocity and frequency increase. The product is a better product in my highly biased opinion than that of a credit card and credit utilization goes up broadly, I think we are the under beneficiaries of that usage given the chance or choice, consumers opt in for more Affirm spend than private card spend and they're rewarded by having no late fees, no compounding interest, all the good things that would bring.\nMichael Ng: Thanks, Max. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Bauch: Hey. Thanks for taking question. Excuse me, if this has already been asked, but I just want to get an update on what you've seen with a Affirm card usage. And anything that surprised you another three months into its evolution around behaviors or categories? Just anything broadly around that would be great.\nMax Levchin: It's going really well. You can see in the supplement that we are continuing to grow it. From my point of view, for what it's worth, we're growing it cautiously for a couple of good reasons. One, it's a new mode of operation, which means that the downstream services such as customer service, dispute resolution, merchant disputes, et cetera, also has to scale. So we're going to grow it deliberately for a little while longer before we feel that we've learned all the important muscle memories of how to handle various conflicts that inevitably occur in commerce, et cetera. And so we feel very good about the growth. We have many, many more turns on potentially increasing that. In terms of surprises, things all generally gone to plan, there is plenty more to do on reasons to use the card more often. We talked about at the investor event last year were dangerously close to actually making good on it. We have reward programs in mind that give people reasons to use the card for all transactions, not just considered purchases. There's plenty to do with tight integration between Affirm card and Affirm account, which we've done a couple of things with, but there's still more features to come. And so -- and from my point of view, the card is still very, very early. There's just a long road map of things to do there, both on the frequency of use basis as well as modalities of making sure that consumers really understand the full power that it brings. And then once we feel that, that's really all figured out, we have a lot more growth to enable there when we see that is the right now to do it.\nAndrew Bauch: And is that next leg of growth just a function of then you finally get the green light to put the extra leg of sales and marketing dollars into the card and to the -- really the solution in order to kind of find that next leg of growth or is it just moving further into the [indiscernible].\nMax Levchin: It's really -- there's -- I don't anticipate any marketing dollars allocated towards distributing the card in any foreseeable future. It's not any budget. That is not how it's going to get grown. And so today, to get the card, you have to have been in a Affirm transactor before. You have to be in good standing, you have to be fairly far down the affirmed journey and then you have to react to one of the -- no, fairly visible sort of adverts when we say, hey, do you want to use the Affirm card? We really think you should try it, you're eligible. So we've marketed it without too much restraints, although it's still being kept to a higher credit quality standard than the overall Affirm. So we're still tilting the scale a little bit in our favor in terms of consumers that get the card offers are not quite at the same level of cutoff as everybody else. And so that's one obvious way of opening up the funnel. But you can imagine a much more aggressive approach for example, right now, you have a choice between taking out a loan on a onetime virtual card number or you can go down the remote of applying for a card. Obviously, taking away the former will naturally increase the latter. So there are several non-dramatic with meaningful levels of growth that we have chosen not to pull on just yet. And then ultimately, if you sign up for Affirm, at some point, you just got to get a card. And that's certainly not a thing we're going to do tomorrow, but that is a meaningful trajectory change.\nAndrew Bauch: So it still sounds like it's going to be pretty targeted for a while here. Great. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Not forecasting any time that stops or goes, but I feel very good about the card growth for now.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Zane Keller for closing comments.\nZane Keller: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thank you, Zane. Thank you all for joining us today. We're excited to share the results of another great quarter. As is our custom, the better the results, the fewer words we used to comment on them. This time around, I feel good enough to go directly to the Q&A. Back to you, Zane. Appreciate the comments, first of all. The underwriting settings, so the single most I would say, accelerated change we've conducted to our, as we call it, Box, it was really more a 1.5 years ago than a year ago. April of '22 is when we saw real stress on the consumer, and we reacted to that sort of within the next 60 days or so. We've since really not done an enormous amount of significant steering. We changed marginal cutoffs on a merchant-by-merchant category by category, product by product basis all the time and also change things like allowed terms as durations required down payments, etc. So we managed credit very, very actively since sort of the beginning of time for us but there's not been a major change to our posture in the last 1.5 years. The numbers that we printed just now are not an accident. We drove them to be what they are very, very deliberately. And I don't want anybody to sort of assume that we're hands off and the numbers just print themselves. It's a lot of work, and we care quite a lot where they end up. We have certain expectations we set with capital markets, and we intend to continue delivering those expectations. And so that's first and foremost. And that governs a lot of our metrics that put to that. The tender share -- share of wallet as we go on internally has done really well over the holidays. We've generally been gaining wallet share, although the stories are different category. And in some cases, merchant to merchant. Feel very good about some of the things that we announced. Obviously, offline. We were not a noticeable player until recently in between the card and some of the online -- offline self-checkout kiosks really powerful. And then just sort of call out one, particularly strong performance over the holidays, especially and overall in the last quarter, Shopify has just continued to perform extraordinarily. The growth of that particular partnership is accelerating three plus years into the partnership. That set of products grew about twice the speed of the rest of Affirm. And so it's just been a story of success to success. And we still have a lot of things that we have not scaled out. They have their own offline aspirations that we're obviously very excited to be a part of, etc. And so it's a little bit of a -- and I'm giving a very long-winded answer here, but frequency for us is being where consumer shops. And share of tender comes as a consequence of being available and being able to support the various consumer needs that as we encounter them. We try to run a tight ship, so surprises are rarely a welcome thing and if they are to the good. I think, I already called that out, but I thought Shopify as a company, years to have done a fantastic job with their products, and we stand to support our partners there and have done it all together. Let's see what other surprises. Don't like surprises, Reggie. I feel like, anytime somebody surprise me, I'm not going to like the outcome. Actually, I'll give you one very surprising fact, which is a little bit of an inside view, but we had very noticeably accelerated our ability to ship software and I had anticipated some of that, but I'm quite surprised about how productive the teams have been on the engineering side, on the product side and design side, sort of percolates down to revenue. So generally speaking, I expected that we would rally around the goals, especially from sort of the low point of this time last year. But the if it's a turnaround, it's a much faster and more aggressive turnaround than I expected. A little early. We gave the future name about 60-something days ago. So it's a little early to brag about the results. But we feel very good about it. It's done in the early versions that it is about as well as we could hope for. We have a lot more things coming for that product, working on a couple of very specific things that are just required before you can really call yourself an account. But feel great. It\u2019s definitely \u2013 and I think I mentioned this before, but there\u2019s kind of three stages of Affirm usage. If you are a not cardholder, non-account holder, regular user, frequencies 4.5 transactions a year and grew again 20% plus year-on-year. But if you have a card that goes up quite a lot, is about 4x, and then it grows again, fairly significantly if you are an account holder. So very excited to give more accounts to people because that\u2019s ultimately a frequency driver for us as well. Thank you. Hi. It's one of the highlights of this last quarter is going unbelievably strong. It accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. The program is over three years old and the fact that it's still picking up steam is just great, and they've been extraordinary partners to us and nothing but wonderful things to say about Tobi and CAS in Arlington team there, and there's just been nothing but excellent in both our execution and the partnership that we had.

One, it's a new mode of operation, which means that the downstream services such as customer service, dispute resolution, merchant disputes, et cetera, also has to scale. So we're going to grow it deliberately for a little while longer before we feel that we've learned all the important muscle memories of how to handle various conflicts that inevitably occur in commerce, et cetera. And so we feel very good about the growth. We have many, many more turns on potentially increasing that. In terms of surprises, things all generally gone to plan, there is plenty more to do on reasons to use the card more often. We talked about at the investor event last year were dangerously close to actually making good on it. We have reward programs in mind that give people reasons to use the card for all transactions, not just considered purchases. There's plenty to do with tight integration between Affirm card and Affirm account, which we've done a couple of things with, but there's still more features to come. And so -- and from my point of view, the card is still very, very early. There's just a long road map of things to do there, both on the frequency of use basis as well as modalities of making sure that consumers really understand the full power that it brings. And then once we feel that, that's really all figured out, we have a lot more growth to enable there when we see that is the right now to do it. It's really -- there's -- I don't anticipate any marketing dollars allocated towards distributing the card in any foreseeable future. It's not any budget. That is not how it's going to get grown. And so today, to get the card, you have to have been in a Affirm transactor before. You have to be in good standing, you have to be fairly far down the affirmed journey and then you have to react to one of the -- no, fairly visible sort of adverts when we say, hey, do you want to use the Affirm card? We really think you should try it, you're eligible. So we've marketed it without too much restraints, although it's still being kept to a higher credit quality standard than the overall Affirm. So we're still tilting the scale a little bit in our favor in terms of consumers that get the card offers are not quite at the same level of cutoff as everybody else. And so that's one obvious way of opening up the funnel. But you can imagine a much more aggressive approach for example, right now, you have a choice between taking out a loan on a onetime virtual card number or you can go down the remote of applying for a card. Obviously, taking away the former will naturally increase the latter. So there are several non-dramatic with meaningful levels of growth that we have chosen not to pull on just yet. And then ultimately, if you sign up for Affirm, at some point, you just got to get a card. And that's certainly not a thing we're going to do tomorrow, but that is a meaningful trajectory change. Not forecasting any time that stops or goes, but I feel very good about the card growth for now."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "Yeah. I think, obviously, if you're thinking in terms of percentage of GMV, there's a number of factors, mix and macro at the top of the list. If you're thinking about total dollars then GMV on the platform was going to be the biggest driver of results there. In terms of the RLTC rate, the take rate on a percentage of GMV, it's really mix and macro. So the mix of business across our merchant base and the products that we offer there. And from a macro perspective, everything going on with consumers and rates would be there. We really like the environment we're in right now. That's why we've updated our full year guidance like we have. And so we feel good about the back half of the year. RLTC margins as a percentage of GMV and feel good about that because of the macro environment that we're in. And we -- as per the usual, we take the current macro signals current levels of unemployment, current forward curve and bake goes into our assumptions. But obviously, there are scenarios where those could move one way or the other, that would change the outcome for us. So travel and ticketing is a very seasonal category. So a lot of folks book summer vacation travel in the first two calendar quarters, last two fiscal quarters, of our year, and it tends to be lowest in terms of bookings in calendar quarters like Q2. And so we think there's a huge seasonality factor there. And for general merchandise, some of our largest merchant enterprise partners fall in that bucket. And as we continue to scale those, we will see lots of purchases there, and it's not unusual for that to be a category that spikes in and around holiday season has a lot of holiday shopping is done in those channels. And the only thing I'd add is we did with the 36% APR cap that we were able to get in place, we were able to be more expansionary in a number of places that is completely done now. And so we wouldn't expect any more volume benefit there, although there is still some margin benefit, we think that will come as the program continues to roll out and scale but we wouldn't expect any more volume there because of 36%. Yeah. We don\u2019t provide a specific guidance number for there. So sometimes the way in which we build our guidance can lead to a little bit of exaggeration on that as you calculate it. But that\u2019s right. And there\u2019s a couple of factors to think about. Firstly, we \u2013 and this will sound very trivial, but I promise you it does actually end up becoming pretty big. We do expect there to be a lot more payroll tax associated with stock-based compensation in our first quarter, both because people have reset their tax obligations to \u2013 with the new year, but also because the share price is higher. And both those two things will create a little bit of the sequential bump from quarter-to-quarter. And then we remain really excited about the opportunities that are ahead for us. And so we\u2019re continuing to be thoughtful around where we should be adding resources to go build new products and chase the new opportunities. And I think the strength in this quarter\u2019s results with respect to our unit economics and operating efficiency, give us license to be willing to add a little operating expense, whereas I think we\u2019ve been very cautious to do that until we could demonstrate it. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, just like we have all year long for the full year, we're only providing a floor or our full year guide. And so we did take our floor up by $1 billion, which we think is a pretty big step up in what we would expect for the year. We remain very upbeat and excited about the opportunity. . So again, I think the full year outlook for us is just a floor. And so we've not given even a range or a ceiling to where we'd expect any calculation being done on Q4 is probably not getting to a midpoint. And any math you're doing on that number inclusive of our Q3 range is taking -- is probably squeezing that number quite a bit. Separate from that, we had a really good Q2, right? And so the really strong second quarter isn't something that we would ever take and say that's a fundamental change of business. That's something we would take credit for, be very happy with, but we'd be pretty cautious about how we would build up the outlook for the balance of the year and want to be mindful of all of the factors that can go into that. But there's nothing in our business that would suggest that we're slowing down right now. That's a great question. So whenever we think about a change in rates, we need to understand why the rates are moving. Certainly, if the rates are moving in response to other stress in the economy, specifically employment, then it's not a one-for-one benefit. But if you hold all other factors constant, then a decline in rates would help us the RLTC line. We would seek to continue to run the business in the 3% to 4% range that we've talked about really since we've gone public. And if we were able to be earning at the high end or above that, we would seek to reinvest that in products to engage and reengage -- acquire new users and reengage them. No. Certainly, we're happy to have the unit economics we do have, but I think we're probably more surprised with the healthy merchant fee growth. Whenever merchant fees outpaced GMV growth, it creates pretty good flow through to the full P&L in a way that's outsized. I think some of the strong performance we had above our expectations around RLTC and the flow-through for the full P&L was actually driven by the really healthy merchant line. Yes, the total aggregate revenue growth wasn't there. But remember, against that, interest income growth is a pretty steep rise in funding costs, and that's driven by both the balance sheet growth as well as the higher benchmark rates that we're in this year. And in fact, interest funding costs grew faster than interest income. And so while that was important for us to be able to get the business where it is, it's also the case that -- we don't see that as the real tailwind here. We're still managing through a rate environment that's substantially lower last year than this year. And as those things abate, then we will begin to see the benefit end of the future. So we've not given any outlook for the card, and I won't now. What I would say in the letter, we talked briefly about the seasonality of the card, and I think this is a really important thing for everybody to pay attention to, which is the card had really strong growth from Q1 to Q2. We would estimate that about half of that growth in card volume was actually underlying seasonality and the other half was growth in the card which just means as you think through where the volume should be for the card in the balance of the year. Just keep in mind the Q2 starting point is benefited by a pretty big step up from Q1 to Q2 from seasonality as consumers do spend more in the holiday season. And we\u2019re still early enough with the card. Fortunately, we\u2019re not seeing things like weather impact our card performance. Yeah. It's a good question. The -- as rates have gone up, any of our longer-term 0% programs have needed higher merchant fees and I really think there's really not much more to it than that. So it's the mix and tied to benchmark rates. In terms of the customers that we bring in, it does skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum when you do those kind of products. But given the high levels of repeat, it's not really going to change the average as much at Affirm. We, of course, have been, we were very active. We're meeting our merchant partners where we could in providing anything promotionally in the second quarter, and we continue to do that. But it's it didn't change an awful lot from the prior quarter in terms of the total mix. So I wouldn't -- I don't really think there's a fundamental trend there. I think the other thing to say is I don't think we're anywhere near the limits on what we think we would think about exposure limits for these users and we're nowhere near some sort of cap there for the population. We think there's a lot of frequency that we can drive with the existing users. Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we did price an ABS deal, and we did so at an all-in cost of capital, 100 basis points lower than a deal we did in December. So in a very short period of time, you're seeing the market really give us credit for that. And that, we think, is a really healthy sign for the capital system and ecosystem overall. And we think is a reflection of both an improved macro outlook for everybody, but for us, more specifically, the disciplined approach to credit that we've taken over the past year is getting valued we think, in the debt capital markets. And so we feel very strong about that. When we do the revolving ABS deals like the one we just did our 248 (ph) deal, those do end up on the balance sheet. And so while we do think about that as a really important funding channel, it isn't off balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet strategies involve mostly selling whole loans, although we do some non-revolving some term securitizations. With respect to the whole loan sales, we feel really excited about both the existing partners expanding and the pipeline of new opportunities that we have. Those conversations have gone very well. I think very consistent with the reaction that the ABS market has had. There's real value being given to us for the kind of credit outcomes that we've driven. And frankly, the yield that we put into the asset has allowed us to continue to be able to sell at prices that aren't really good for us. As is always the case, and we've said since day 1, we don't have one strategy that's better than the other. The things that we do are first and foremost, enable the growth in the business, and I'm extremely proud of the way the team has been able to support the capital program over the past year through all the volatility remaining enabling all the growth that we've delivered. The second priority is to deliver our unit economics. Clearly, if we\u2019re running the 3% to 4% range like we did this past quarter, we feel very strong about that. And then we begin to want to manage the capital efficiency of the program. That\u2019s the third piece. And obviously, whole loan sales are more efficient but it\u2019s the third of the three priorities. And so we wouldn\u2019t really want to overuse that lever. And then the last comment is each of our capital strategies really exists and reinforce one another. And so you really won\u2019t see us pivot to one or the other. We\u2019re going to continue to scale all of our channels. That means continued ABS execution, continued forward flow and continued use of our warehouse lines. No. I don't think the card is going to drive different credit outcomes for the whole portfolio. I think the level of repeat usage might where you do see better credit outcomes on repeat users overall, but I don't think the card is big enough really to affect the total portfolio numbers yet. Obviously, when it gets much larger, it will begin to have a more material impact. But for now, I think it's small enough and yes, there's really nothing to point to specifically on the charge-offs. Again, I think about our charge-off policy, we charge off at 120 days. Delinquencies once they get to past 60 or 90 days are overwhelmingly likely to go towards charge-offs. So we have a pretty good sense of that and full allowance at all times to handle the future charge-offs that we estimate. Yeah. I think the strong units give us permission to do that more than anything. So we talked about 3% to 4% in the revenue less transaction cost as a percentage of GMV. That\u2019s the real constraint for us. And so if we\u2019re in that range, we can continue to be very aggressive on acquiring and reengaging new users. And that\u2019s really the constraint much more so than anything else. So on the first question, it really is just a function of the mix in our business. And that's always been true for merchant rates. We always talk about merchant fee rates as being mix driven. That's why we began breaking it out in the supplement. The slight tick-up you see on one of the categories is really just a function of mix within that category, but also as duration goes up, so does the price, especially in this rate environment, where it's pretty duration sensitive in terms of the price you charge. I don't -- again, I don't think there's a broader trend to be read into there. And on the frequency question, I'll let Max answer that."

At this time, all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Following the speakers\u2019 remarks, we will open the lines for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on Affirm\u2019s Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nZane Keller: Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone listening that today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website.

Hosting today\u2019s call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm\u2019s founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Linford, Affirm\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin today\u2019s call, we would like to remind investors that we will be holding an investor forum next Tuesday, November 14th, from 2 to 5 pm Eastern Time. Both the livecast of the forum as well as a replay are open to the public. Additional details about the forum, including registration information, are available on our Investor Relations website. In line with our practice in prior quarters, we will begin with brief opening remarks from Max before proceeding immediately into questions and answers. On that note, I will turn the call over to Max to begin.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Zane. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I keep it very brief. We had a very strong fiscal Q1, exceeded our outlook across all metrics. GMV growth accelerated sequentially. We significantly exceeded our own outlook for revenue less transaction costs. We continued to gain market share, kept our already strong economics quite good, drove positive credit outcomes, which matters to us the most, and added some funding capacity. Our plans now include continuing to invest in risk management, technology and product development, and to turn our attention to growing Affirm faster. Back to you, Zane.\nZane Keller : Thank you, Max. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. And congrats on the solid results. Just thinking about -- we head into the second quarter here, given the outperformance in the first, especially in GMV and volume. What kind of led to the outperformance? And then, it looks like the growth rate will decelerate back a little bit after accelerating this quarter in the second quarter, maybe you can just help us with that? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: I think, I\u2019ll take the why the growth. I think we\u2019ve just been executing really well. As you saw just the overall operating leverage, we are firing in all pistons of the Company, which it feels very good. We\u2019re able to deliver a couple of really key initiatives on the product side. Our friends in Ottawa, in particular, we had several really strong ideas that played out very well for us there. And so Shopify volume accelerated again, which sort of speaks to maybe the way we operate the business. It sometimes seems like you signed a great partner and that\u2019s the burst of volume. But in reality, it takes us years to fully realize the opportunity for us when partnerships are this rich and with this much potential. So that\u2019s one example. Card grew quite well as well and so we\u2019re happy with those results. There\u2019s not one thing that I can stick a finger at and say that this is the core reason for the GMV growth. But the other thing is that the demand for the product remains strong. We are still declining quite a number of applicants, because we\u2019re trying to remain as thoughtful and productive in our credit outcomes, but the consumer demand for what we have to offer is continuing to pull it forward.\nMichael Linford: The only thing I\u2019d comment on for Q2 is, it\u2019s our largest quarter of the year. And so, we just have a lot more math in the comparable period. And we do expect that some of our programs, our largest enterprise partner programs are continuing to mature in a way that we just expect a little bit less growth this year than we had in the last quarter.\nBryan Keane: And then just as a quick follow-up, Michael, maybe you can talk a little bit about adjusted operating profit came in quite a bit ahead of expectations. Is that some timing of expense items that even out throughout the year, or anything to call out there for the margin in the first quarter versus for the quarters for the rest of the year?\nMichael Linford: Yes. The adjusted operating income did come in well ahead of where we thought it was going to be for the quarter. And I think it shows the power of us and our technology orientation. When we are able to control expenses and drive a little bit of extra growth, the growth and profitability is very, very strong. And to put it in context, we have 28% GMV growth or 37% revenue growth and our non-transaction operating expenses reduced on an absolute basis by $50 million year-on-year. When that happens, obviously, you can print pretty strong results. I think due to our outperformance, we did raise the outlook for the full year. We\u2019re now expecting closer to 5%. And I think that we were driving leverage really across all three lines, G&A, sales and marketing, and tech data and analytics. And those lines are all very leverageable in our business. We\u2019ve been saying this for quite some time. And yet that\u2019s also the area we invest in, primarily in human capital. We want to make sure we maintain the ability to invest in the back half of the year, which is why we wouldn\u2019t expect to run at this level. But no, there really wasn\u2019t any sort of timing benefit. We will expect sales and marketing to creep up a little bit in Q2 as we invest into the holiday season. But other than that, we feel like Q1 was very close to run rate before we again maintain some -- bring to make some investments in the back half of the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: I just have two. First, as a follow-up to the first question around Shop Pay Installments GMV growth acceleration. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what functionally changes or ramps up over time that allows you to drive this acceleration in GMV over two years since the initial partnership? And what can that tell us about how you approach some of these enterprise partnerships? And then, I have a quick follow-up.\nMax Levchin: I\u2019m known to give long winded answers, so I\u2019ll actually try to keep this one shorter. The very short hand answer is optimization. Both companies are very numerically driven. We spend an incredible amount of energy just EV testing, various forms of presentation of the products we offer to consumers, try to simplify things, try to fine-tune everything from how do we explain interest if there\u2019s interest to pay. How do we make sure people understand that there is no interest in products like paying for. Just all of that. And if you have a -- one of the sort of obvious truisms if you will is if you have a significant amount of volume already, even 1% or 2% increase in end to end conversion just creates millions or tens of millions of dollars of incremental GMV. So it\u2019s never a -- sometimes it is sort of a brilliant unlock where we say, oh, we forgot this thing we can try and it works, but 9 out of 10 times it\u2019s really just optimizing existing consumer experience, finding ways of presenting the offer a little bit more up funnel so consumer understands there is a budget perhaps more than the budget they realize because we can tell them here\u2019s what we are willing to approve you for et cetera. And then, just doing that over and over again has compounding effects. So, there\u2019s not a -- the secret sauce is in the work, not in secret.\nMichael Ng: And then maybe just a quick one on Affirm Card, $224 million of GMV, accelerating from the $130 million last quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re approaching driving growth there? The user growth seemed like it was steady at that $75,000 per month? And anything you could tell us around the mix of Affirm Card GMV and how that may have changed relative to last quarter? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: So I don\u2019t want to steal too much of Libor\u2019s show next week, to quote my favorite movie, I\u2019d love all of you to come and give me notes when we do investor forum a week from now. But the shorthand is, the mix remained largely in line with what we said last quarter. It\u2019s still more split pay -- or split transactions versus paid in full. We\u2019ll talk a lot about things like cohort retention and usage over time and a little bit about lifetime value next week. So, there\u2019s a lot to share, and I don\u2019t want spoil the party too much. The growth is quite strong. It is managed to the number that we want. We have internal goals that we are driving card numbers to. We won\u2019t run out of opportunities there for some time. We also want to make sure that we don\u2019t paint ourselves into a corner in the following sense. The product is a new idea. This is not something that existed before. We have lots of intellectual property protection around some of the stuff that we invented both kind of what meets the eye and what\u2019s under the hood there. And every time you launch a new product, even if it has exceptional uptake, which we think this one does, you are educating a consumer. You have to look for long-term effects. Like, one of my many nighttime jobs is to read consumer feedback that comes to me directly from the card and it\u2019s now a very steady stream of content. And a lot of it is about sort of getting in touch with our PMs and saying, hey, there\u2019s this wrinkle on the card that people still don\u2019t fully understand, how do we fix this? Again, so in service of that, let\u2019s get 3% more conversion, let\u2019s get 5% more conversion. The card is so new, every time we find some major comprehension unlock, we find ourselves in another 10% gain. So, it\u2019s gratifying to unblock -- fix a mistake we made or unblock a comprehension detail and suddenly lot more volume. So, we\u2019ll continue growing users quite deliberately. We\u2019ll be very, very focused on unblocking all the quirks of these interface, doing all the educating that we have to do before we start sending a card to everybody as they sign up. But over the long period of time, I fully expect to get to a place that is, hey, welcome to Affirm, the card\u2019s in the mail. That\u2019s not going to happen anytime in the immediate or even foreseeable future. But the long-term point of the card is, it is the best way of experiencing Affirm. We will build all of our product roadmaps on this idea of you should have this card, it is the best thing ever and you should just have one of these, even if you\u2019ve transacted with Affirm for the first time yesterday.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Dolev of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results. So proud. Max, the B2B initiatives in the Amazon partnership, I think it was last week, got a lot of excitement and a lot of press. Can you maybe tell us what makes you so excited about this, kind of the opportunity, sizing it and maybe talking whether or not there\u2019ll be other B2B partners? And then, I have a very quick follow-up. Thank you.\nMax Levchin: Thank you, Dan. We are very proud too, but I really appreciate hearing that. The team works very hard. I know a bunch of Affirm folks are listening. You nailed it this quarter. Thank you for your hard work. The B2B thing that we started showing is certainly not a one-off. In fact, when we start reviewing the opportunity, my ask to the team was please come back to me with a plan of what this looks like in a market, sort of what\u2019s the true opportunity across many, many possible platforms, not just one. So yes, you should expect us to do more. Obviously, we will speak to it when we\u2019re good and ready. The current product as you see it today is for sole proprietorships. And it\u2019s this interesting space where the efficiency of the lending market to that user is really, really poor. And so, as a result, the consumer typically borrows money either on their personal financial devices, which is just for a variety of reasons a bad idea, or through all kinds of just unoptimized old school sort of 19th century lending platforms. And there\u2019s no reason why that should be this way, given our expertise and underwriting, in particular underwriting consumers. So expanding our models to small, very small full proprietorship type business underwriting was not a huge challenge. The actual work began something like more than a year ago where we primarily just tested will our underwriting work as well as it does in consumer if we expanded it to very small businesses. And obviously, we feel confident enough to start rolling it out with the largest e-commerce player. So, feel very positive about it. We\u2019ll be very deliberate. It\u2019s a new business for us. Nothing is -- we will not do anything that damages our stellar credit performance. That\u2019s certainly, as always job number one, but exciting. There\u2019s lots of merchants that have very sizable side hustles, if you will, where they sell their goods or goods on their platform to sell props that either use them or resell them and they too need some honest financial services and here we are for that.\nDan Dolev: That\u2019s super helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up for you or for Michael. I mean, I was - what caught my eye in the shareholder letter was the ability to sustain 3% to 4% revenue less transaction costs. We all know that with the key pushback from clients that we were talking to. It sounds like you guys have figured out a way to -- for this not to be a problem anymore. So maybe just kind of walk us a little bit through sort of the path to making sure that this 3% to 4% is sustainable even in a higher for longer environment. Thank you, again.\nMichael Linford: Yes. We\u2019re really proud that we were towards the high end of our long-term range in a quarter when we were obviously up against substantially lower rate environment, and we feel like we\u2019re settling into the higher for longer. I think there\u2019s maybe two things to call out. The first is that we\u2019ve done a really good job of making sure our assets have the right economic content in them. In our letter, we do plot what the yield of our asset is and also where our funding costs have gone. And you can see that, certainly you\u2019ll see a pretty big inflection towards the end on the Affirm asset yield, and that\u2019s a reflection of our pricing initiatives but also the really strong credit controls that we\u2019ve had place over the past year. And it all starts there, you got to get the asset yield right, but then the second piece is really important is we\u2019ve been executing really well in the capital markets. We have added forward flow partners to the mix, which of course helps the imperative earning power as you can sell loans and earn the gain on sale, which is really important for us to do. And maybe notably is that the percentage of loans sold in our first quarter was more in line with the historical averages than we had been in the prior quarter, which was a pretty depressed level. And so, what you\u2019re seeing is the benefit of the improvement to the asset yield and the benefit of the capital markets execution, which in turn is a benefit of the discipline that we\u2019ve had on the asset yield, right? Those two things are very much linked. And you\u2019re seeing it really shine right now where our engagement with capital markets partners is really positive. Max mentioned that we went and saw many folks over the past couple of months, and the discipline that we\u2019ve had is really giving us credit there. And so, that\u2019s what gives us confidence that this rate environment is one that we can operate well in. We\u2019ve done the work to get the asset yields that they need to be. We\u2019re getting credit for it in the capital market. And our focus is really around, at this point, continuing to scale the network, we\u2019ve earned the right to do that.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Bauch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Bauch: Just wanted to ask a general state of the consumer kind of question. I know that the student loan forgiveness or forbearance is coming due. And so, any kind of updated thoughts on how you think that impacts overall demand? And then, maybe like a higher level question. As macro is deteriorating, I mean has deteriorated, and in the past, you\u2019ve said that there is a reasonable possibility that BNPL becomes a more preferred payment method, in more challenging economic times. Just trying to get a sense of have things kind of played out the way that you had anticipated in both of those opportunities.\nMax Levchin: A lot to go there. So, on the student loan, that\u2019s an easy one. So we said it for two quarters in a row before this one, we too got very seriously. Obviously, nobody had sort of real sense for exactly what it would look like. I gave Dan props last quarter because he really something that predicted pretty precisely what we thought would happen to student loan repayment, impact on our ability to approve people. And the point is we\u2019ve been looking at it for months and months and months and incorporated underwriting changes to make sure we are prepared for the student loan repayment resumption. At this point, they\u2019ve been effectively back, the obligations for a month and a little bit. We feel that we\u2019ve handled it really well. We can see it in our credit prints that it had no material impact on us. In fact, the slight increase that we saw was seasonality exactly as we predicted. So, we did a really good job preparing for that and largely think it\u2019s behind us. I think just more broadly, that has been our strength as a company. We take underwriting as the single most important thing we cannot make a mistake on. And we obsess over it. We look at all the metrics all the time. We call five alarm fires every time, some metric -- ever so slightly off to make sure that we know exactly why it is. And that\u2019s what has allowed us to maintain this level of performance in credit. I\u2019m not sure I agree that the economy has deteriorated. That\u2019s a very broad statement. There are definitely signs of stress going back as far as April of 2022. It\u2019s, generally speaking, for our consumer not been a dramatic change in their ability to pay their bills back because -- remains effectively fully employed. Obviously, the most recent unemployment numbers start to show some very modest cracks in the full employment number, but still very, very strong relative to what we would consider to be serious area of concern. And we tune our models to both internally sourced data of actual repayments and the macroeconomic inputs such as job prints is what we consider as we try to forecast the not very distant future. The reason we don\u2019t need to forecast the very distant future is because the terms of our loans are really, really short. So, we have to be right about what\u2019s going to happen to our consumer in the near-term much more than we have to predict the world economic future. As far as the BNPL popularity, we\u2019re certainly seeing a stronger demand as we had seen in points of time. It does help that we are the only player of scale that is willing to write monthly installment loans. The paying for was a pretty cool idea when it was all fun and games and zero interest rates to underwrite people for 6 months loan and 12 months loans, you have to be quite a bit more detail oriented and thoughtful in our modeling and that is our strength and the source of our overall superiority. We feel very good about our ability to continue performing in those loans as well as the shorter term stuff. It seems that offering the full spectra of products really does drive consumer preference, but obviously still a very, very competitive market and we\u2019re not going to declare victory just yet. But it does seem that the BNPL has remained a consumer favorite. Certainly, the Affirm version of BNPL remained a consumer favorite, given as the economic party may have gotten a little bit cooler.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: I know the shareholder letter mentioned that you\u2019ve seen some disparate GMV trends among some of the various categories that you serve. So, I\u2019m wondering just as you look at the guide -- the updated guide for fiscal \u201824, are you assuming any material change in the more discretionary categories?\nMichael Linford: No, we\u2019re really not. So as per the usual, we try to hold what we\u2019re seeing right now when we provide our guidance. And we don\u2019t really assume things are going to get materially better or worse because we really don\u2019t try to prognosticate too much about where the economy is going. We do see some positive trends right now. You\u2019re seeing categories that were real decliners over the couple of quarters returned to something that looks more like flat, certainly less decline. And we think that\u2019s a good healthy sign. And obviously, we still have exposure to some of the largest platforms in e-commerce, and that does -- that breadth of exposure allows us to get pretty wide category coverage. And so, the more operative question for us is, are consumers going to be out spending, and we certainly feel like the evidence is right now that they are.\nJason Kupferberg: Max, you touched briefly on decline rates. And I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any notable change in those decline rates, not just in terms of this year, percent of loan requests that you\u2019re declining. But just how that might vary across different slices of your demographic, or are you seeing certain consumers coming back with more loan requests more frequently?\nMax Levchin: I\u2019ll start by reminding that decline for us is kind of the point of last resort. So, for a huge percentage of underwriting decisions, what we try to do and do pretty well is say, yes and, and is we need you to make a down-payment. We think that you should borrow, not $800 for example, but $600. And if you have [$200] to make a down-payment, that will be wonderful. And so that\u2019s just an important thing to keep in mind. So, when sort of -- we look at our approval rates, they\u2019ve largely remained broadly the same. Obviously between sort of groups of consumers if you stratify them by credit, they generally remain the same. But by definition, the credit mix, the input mix has not really changed all that much. So very broadly, the answer is no, we\u2019re not seeing anything dramatic. The one thing that\u2019s really -- that we have to mention, so we said it last quarter that we\u2019re on track to broadened our EPR range from 0% to 36%. Obviously before we were between 0% and 30% as we broadened it to 36%. The natural consequence of that is we\u2019re able to approve a little bit more books. And that is a great tool to have. Obviously, the number one job that we have vis-\u00e0-vis consumers is to offer them access to credit in a transparent fairly priced way. Having a wider range of prices available to us does allow us to say yes to more people. So, all these to people -- you\u2019ll see us probably on the margin be slightly more approveful, if that\u2019s a new word. I made that up. I thought I\u2019d start a word go. But, being able to price the risk in allows us to say yes more often.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Wildhack of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wildhack: I wanted to ask about the higher allowance quarter-over-quarter, maybe follow-on from that last question. Can you speak to the drivers there? And then, given the short duration that you\u2019re emphasizing, I\u2019m curious the degree to which you think of changes in the allowance as proactive, i.e., we receive credit versus reactive, i.e., things kind of started looking worse than we expected?\nMichael Linford: It\u2019s definitely not reactive, meaning things look worse. It\u2019s very mathematical for us. So, we make an estimate of the losses for all loans we have on the balance sheet at any point in time and we make sure that we have an allowance appropriate to support that. As you change the mix of on- and off-balance sheet a quarter-over-quarter, so the increase in sold loans does drive the math to be higher this period, given the fact that you\u2019re selling more early stage loans. And so, you naturally have a little bit of shift there. But we don\u2019t view that as a bad thing. It\u2019s certainly not a reflection of underlying credit performance. We think the underlying credit performance remains exactly where we\u2019d like it to be. And when we have the kind of unit economics that we have this quarter, which is really strong at the high end of our 3% to 4% range, obviously, we\u2019re very comfortable with the amount of provision needed to support the growth in allowance.\nRob Wildhack: And then, maybe one on the regulatory front. The CFPB has been pretty active with respect to buy now, pay later and even fintech more broadly. So what are your latest thoughts on their role? And then how do you see that evolving going forward? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: Yes. So we\u2019ve always viewed them as one of our key regulators. I\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time on their advisory board a few years ago, so on. So obviously being subject to supervision from our point of view is a formalization of the relationship between Affirm and bureau. We think we may be somewhat unique in this, but we think it\u2019s a positive step for the industry, most importantly, sort of normalizes the engagement with the regulatory bodies. It\u2019s also good for consumers for obvious reasons and good for us because we think it levels the playing field in quite a number of centers. We\u2019ve been in contact with the bureau for a long, long time and certainly expect to continue being engaged with them. Our priorities remain exactly what they have been. We are everything, if not transparent and clear with the end borrower and that certainly aligns very well with the mission of the bureau. So, I feel -- generally speaking, feel quite good about the regulatory engagement.\nOperator: The next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question this evening. I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape in general. It seems like the stability and the merchant fee rates that you guys lay out in the slide presentation points to a pretty rational environment there, but you mentioned taking some market share. How are your conversations with merchants going -- merchant partners going and how is this sales pipeline kind of progressing in that context? \nMax Levchin: It\u2019s more rational now than it was before. I wouldn\u2019t call it fully rational just yet. I think it\u2019s harder -- with every passing moment, so long as we agree that the overall economic reality is not on a positive direction. And as I said in a previous question, we have not seen sort of a dramatic turn for the worse, but we are very, very active in managing credit. It is a competitive advantage for us and I think, if I\u2019m completely honest, it\u2019s a bit of a soft spot for some of the competition. And so, what this does to merchants, if our competitors are rational, is they have to tighten approval dramatically. They can\u2019t separate risk as well as we can. The only way to not have losses is just decline indiscriminately a lot more. Our strength is ability to separate good and bad risk and therefore we can maintain high approvals. That has served us really, really well over the years. There\u2019s lots of stories to tell from the earliest days of Affirm where some extremely valuable logo merchant would come to us and say well, the competitor of your just showed up and they offered us half the price, so we\u2019re going to clue you and go there. And during those times, I would sort of stress and worry that this means everything is broken about this company, and we always maintained with much urging and occasional head slapping from Michael. We maintained a discipline of saying, look, if this is an irrational deal, we will not sign it. And most often those merchants would come back to us and say, actually the weirdest thing happened, we are paying a much lower price, but the approvals suck. And it\u2019s not an accident. If you are good at managing risk, you know how to price it, and if you know how to price it, you can then deliver it at a fair price to both the consumer and the merchant. And so, as it becomes a little bit harder or for some folks obviously a lot harder to underwrite, it\u2019s a little bit easier to prove to our partners that being rational on a pricing side is really important. So, this conversation will become a little bit easier. To sort of break it down even more and I promise I\u2019ll stop in a second, but it\u2019s an obviously super important topic that I spent a fair amount of time on. The thing that really becomes interesting is you talk to folks that run these merchant companies and some of them are still very, very focused on bottom line, others are on top line, and sometimes it\u2019s a function of having inventory, sometimes it\u2019s a function of trying to meet growth targets for investing purposes. Depending on that, their goals change. And the thing that we\u2019re really, really good at is tuning financial offers for consumers to meet merchants\u2019 financial targets. If they are if the merchant is very focused on driving inventory out of the warehouse or off their virtual shelves, we\u2019re very good at creating consumer offers at no APR, fixed low APR that we can dynamically price for the merchant and the consumer and make those transactions happen. If the merchant is very focused on their own bottom line, we\u2019re very comfortable working with them to reduce or to drive their MDRs down to make sure that their costs are under huge degree of control and passing the cost on to the consumer. Because we are so transparent with pricing to both sides, it\u2019s never a mystery and never this sort of a black box negotiation where everybody feels like they\u2019ve been somehow hurt by this whole process. We\u2019re very, very clear with our merchants. Here\u2019s exactly what you can get in the current environment with the current approvals. And over the years, that\u2019s built a reputation for us that just worked time and time again. And so, the conversations have always been rational with the merchants that we have and that\u2019s why you see our MDRs quite stable and our merchant base quite well retained.\nMichael Linford: A couple of things just to add. The market will continue to be competitive. This is a growing category for a reason. Consumers are seeking out alternatives. And so we expect the market to continue to be competitive. We expect to continue to be rational in the face of competitors who want to be less rational, but we expect competition. And then, to specifically answer your question around the pipeline, we don\u2019t disclose any pipeline stats, but we feel good about the level of commercial activity right now. There\u2019s lots of great conversations happening and we remain, in conversations today that we probably couldn\u2019t have had a few years ago given some of the irrationality. So, we think that\u2019s a good thing, but those are conversations in pipeline, so there\u2019s certainly nothing concrete there.\nRamsey El-Assal: Fantastic. And then, a quick follow-up for me. In the shareholder letter, you mentioned some improvements at checkout with Affirm at brick and mortar, big box partner and also I think expanding the partnership with Verifone. How should we think about that physical opportunity, the brick and mortar opportunity? And does that kind of change now with Affirm Card in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about monetizing sort of the physical transaction, or are there still -- is there still another leg potentially that you can develop here by perfecting that physical Affirm at checkout experience?\nMax Levchin: You must have been spying on our conversation with Michael yesterday. Jokes aside. Yes, the short answer is absolutely, we\u2019ve been caged in this e-commerce cage for a very long time and feel very good about our -- breaking out into the bigger wide open commerce space writ large. Affirm works pretty well in store if the merchant is cooperating. So depending on where you go you\u2019ll find us in a kiosk, you will find us on your phone, but speaking to the phone of a store associate. There\u2019s a bunch of modalities that we\u2019ve developed over the years. And they all work fairly well for existing users. And if the merchant helps, they can even help us with user acquisition. The card just supercharges this thing like a totally different level. Again, I\u2019m going to bite my tongue on some of the cool stats, I think we\u2019re going to show off next week, but we\u2019ll talk a little bit about the success we\u2019re seeing offline with the card. But even beyond that, we do think that there\u2019s work to be done, ideas to be tried offline, even before the consumer gets the card, and that\u2019s a pretty exciting thing. At this point, as Michael put it yesterday, Wi-Fi or cell coverage in a store next to a store to solve problem. And we do have a 80%-ish app download for existing users and a very, very high propensity to download our app just because the brand and the app reviews have been so strong. So feel very good about what we\u2019ll do offline. It is brick and mortar, which means that it moves a little bit slower, but the price is worth the effort.\nOperator: The next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: A couple of follow-up questions on things you\u2019ve already talked about, Max and Michael. First, in terms of like the engagement with the merchants and that kind of thing. I\u2019m wondering how active your conversations are beyond just kind of making available to them what they\u2019re -- what they could do from a promotional perspective on interest rates, et cetera? And the reason I ask is because in the period of rising interest rates and kind of normalizing retail activity, I would have thought we would have seen a bit more 0% promotional activity on the part of merchant partners to date and maybe I\u2019m just missing it, et cetera, or its impact on your financials so far, but just wondering what that process looks like.\nMax Levchin: That\u2019s certainly a major part of the conversation. I think I sort of started answering this and Michael has a lot of opinion on this one, so I\u2019ll call him in a second. But the shorthand is it really depends on the merchant margin structure. If your overall world view is co-points to margin, lots of turns of inventory, you just don\u2019t have the margin capacity to drive these 0% deals unless the manufacturer is willing to contribute. And we\u2019ve sort of dropped the breadcrumbs of that idea for quite some time and obviously it\u2019s a massive sales and engineering effort where you\u2019re trying to tie more than just the consumer and the seller, but also consumer and the seller and a manufacturer or brand or some other third-party that wants to subsidize the interest. So, that\u2019s a fun design and engineering challenge, but we\u2019ve been making very, very steady progress. There\u2019s a sort of a point in my letter about what we internally call mixed carts, which I think I referenced as the ability to combine multiple financing programs. If you have a manufacturer or brand that\u2019s sponsoring a 0% deal, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a TV manufacturer and you\u2019re buying that TV and a bag of cookies and the cookies are not 0% sponsored, you have to be able to provide correct accounting for both sides of the transaction, but consumer think of it as a single basket. And so before we got to full distribution of the brand sponsor promotions as we call them, we have to deploy robust implementation of mixed cart accounting and sort of downstream transactional and capital markets work. So, that took us a fair amount of time and effort just to sign as to how complex some of this stuff can be. Now that we have that that live, we have a variety of really rich conversations around, hey, let\u2019s have a 0% promotion and no, you don\u2019t have to directly fund the EPR discount, Mr. Merchant. So that\u2019s one side of it. If your margin structure is, I got 60% gross margin and maybe a subscription to support future revenue streams, of course, you want to do 0% deals and that becomes a much, much easier conversation. So we have merchants of both kinds and everything in between. We work pretty closely with them. As the holidays roll along, people start becoming very concerned with driving inventory off the shelves, sometimes into the holidays, sometimes right after depending on sort of what they think will happen to them or what does happen to them around five days of sales around Thanksgiving, and so we\u2019ll certainly support all those, but a big part of who we are is we\u2019re fundamentally an engineering company, and so building these tools is what we enjoy the most. As we ship new tools, we immediately bring them to market to our merchant partners, offering them new ways of driving more sales. And so, we have quite a lot of fun stuff that we shipped in the last 60, 90 days and all of that will get deployed and into the holidays.\nMichael Linford: The only thing I\u2019d add is, we have been intentional around introducing fixed APR offers. This is low APRs, I think 5% and 10% APR offers into the merchant base. And those serve, the same -- the promotional role that is 0% served in a 0% rate environment. And I think those have been well received and have consumed a lot. And then lastly, I just -- there\u2019s a merchant mix here that matters a lot in this conversation. The merchant platforms that are stealing the most right now have the most interest bearing mix. And I think that probably distorts the trend I think you\u2019re pulling on, which is a little bit below the surface and overwhelmed by just the mix across our merchant base. So as you sell less exercise bikes and you sell more general merchandise that those trends tend to play out that way.\nJames Faucette: And then separately on Debit+ and the like. How are you seeing -- clearly like you\u2019re seeing a pickup in GMV and frequency of use, et cetera. How is that use tracking versus your expectation of people using it for debit type transactions versus some sort of credit generating transaction? Thanks.\nMax Levchin: That\u2019s definitely the star of the show next week. So, I\u2019ll give you a light preview versus the very wholesome presentation, which you should expect next week. Generally speaking, it\u2019s tracking two expectations. What you\u2019ll hear a bunch about next week is it\u2019s becoming a very clear journey where we are teaching consumers about a new product. When they just sign up for the cards -- so these are all repeat consumers. They\u2019re not -- we\u2019ve never spent a penny marketing the card. There\u2019s no big billboards over one-on-one or anything like that. It\u2019s just the card that you get if you like Affirm and we offer it to you and we -- we haven\u2019t pushed it particularly hard just yet. When you do get it, the first sort of comprehension hurdle is, hey, this is just like Affirm where I ask for a loan and I get approved and it works. But now it works, I can consummate the transaction with a card. So your first intellectual hurdle is, it\u2019s Affirm on a piece of plastic, that\u2019s cool. So, you can\u2019t expect that to become your daily spending instrument because Affirm today is for everything from dresses to fancy workout equipment, but it\u2019s not in your mind just yet for a cup of coffee. Over time you see folks slowly recognize that actually it\u2019s pretty cool. It provides some buyer protection, unlike your debit card. It has a bunch of really neat features like you can say, oh, this transaction is actually a little bit more than I wanted to spend. I can go back in time and split it, if that\u2019s appropriate. And so, as people understand all the functionality of the card, which is not something that they pick up in a day or two, it actually - we have a whole bunch of work that we put in. This quarter -- if you have used the card before, you kind of missed out on a whole bunch of really neat things that we shipped as a first time user experience through the whole pile of features helping people understand all the various things that are capable of. We start graduating people to more and more transactions and I\u2019ll bite my tongue on some of the really cool reveals. But we have -- so the tip of the spear the consumers that really get at how it works are tracking better than expectations. I\u2019m very, very excited about that group. And our job is really now taking the customer through, hey, this is Affirm card to -- this is actually something I could use instead of my debit card. It\u2019s good for everything and that\u2019s going really well. The card team will tell you that I occasionally message them in the middle of the night and mostly to find out that they\u2019re already working on the idea that I just had and I literally -- my last message in the slack channel to the car team, okay, okay, I\u2019ll get out of your hair, you have thought of everything. So I\u2019m very excited about how well we\u2019re going. Lots of work to do though. Definitely very, very far from done.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: I appreciate you guys taking the question. Very thorough discussion of the business, so that\u2019s helpful. Max, could you talk a little bit about trends in Affirm\u2019s tender with your enterprise customers versus across the entire business and whether you\u2019re sort of closing that gap, we\u2019ve seen on big days like Amazon Prime Day where apparently BNPL oversamples. What I think you\u2019ve talked about is being your total tender share, and maybe just an update there on how much runway there is in closing that and whether or not ultimately you can grow that beyond the total company?\nMax Levchin: Certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to comment on any one particular partner, although obviously we feel we\u2019ve done really well there. But if you look at share of cart, as we call it, in our largest partners, we\u2019re far from done. I refer you back to my -- one of my bragging points. Shopify partnership has been around for three years, and I think several folks in the analyst community have written that off as well. It\u2019s now stable and will grow some sort of a single digits slow grower because they\u2019re fully integrated now and yet the volume there keeps accelerating because both companies are excited to build new things and try to deliver more value to both merchants and consumers. So we certainly have a lot more room to grow in all of our very large partnerships. Frankly, I think we have a lot of room to grow in small ones as well. The large ones obviously pay off better because when you unlock something to the tune of 1%, you\u2019re playing with billions instead of millions. So feel very good about there -- about that. The companies are enormous. They have lots of conflicting priorities. And so, it will absolutely take longer than our average efforts, especially because -- the reason these companies chose us is because we are technologists and we build software really, really well. That means that majority of integrations are complex. If you\u2019re a tiny little company and you take our standard API and implement it and we bring you live. Literally, it can be done at this point in a self-service environment for small companies. That\u2019s pretty awesome, and I bragged about that in the letter as well. For a much larger partner, this is a real effort and it takes quarters to get it right and make sure all the plumbing works and scales and handles things like Prime Days, which are enormous spikes of volume. And so once that\u2019s there, deploying optimizations and changes and new initiatives is not a thing you can sort of flip a switch and see what happens. You have to follow the thoroughness and deliberate nature of such efforts, but when they do work, they are dramatic leads. And so we certainly have many more leads to take. Obviously, I\u2019m extremely biased, so sort of discount that appropriately. I do think the product we offer works better than credit cards, and credit cards are the dominant way to pay across all these merchants. We feel like we have lots more share to grab it.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay, helpful. And then -- I\u2019ve asked you this question before. The 91% of transactions from existing customers, that KPI or that stat. Does that number over time for you to achieve your goals need to come down a lot, just as far as greater acceptance and use across the base? And does Affirm Card help you get there or am I just barking up the wrong tree?\nMax Levchin: I certainly don\u2019t think you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree. It\u2019s something that I look at a lot. The way I think about it is every consumer has a certain amount of spend that they\u2019re doing today, some of it on credit, some of it from cash, we are competing for that. We are not trying to create new debts where there wasn\u2019t some because we are -- obviously we don\u2019t charge late fees, we don\u2019t compound interest, so we don\u2019t benefit from delinquency, we don\u2019t benefit from spending. We are very careful not to overextend our consumers. Part of the mission is to create healthier financial realities for our customers, not to push them into unsustainable spending. And so, we are trying to shift spending onto our instruments. Depending on kind of how far you cast your eye in the future of Affirm, obviously, first time transactions that number you\u2019re talking about will come down. As we get to more and more customers underwritten, by definition that number will start trending up. So I don\u2019t know if I have a -- the right number is 78.37. That\u2019s the perfect one, and -- not at all, I look at it as a indicator of where we are. The reality of new versus repeating users for us kind of a two sided coin if you will. New users are the highest risk loans we will write. When you have never transacted with a firm before, by definition we don\u2019t know you as well as we do someone who has transacted already. So, wherever we take a more careful risk stance and we have been in a relatively conservative one for quite some time, you can expect us to be deliberately careful with approving new consumers. On the other hand, we are very excited to take more and more share from our friends in the credit card world. And so, we are delighted when the frequency goes up which is in fact reflected in the percentage of transactions from repeat users. So, there are multiple vectors on this metric, not too obsessed with it. I care a lot more about overall GMV growth. Credit metrics obviously are absolutely paramount. Frequency of consumer is something that I look quite a lot about, although it\u2019s worth saying that at this point we see very clear stratification of consumers. People have chosen that Affirm is their primary spending device and those numbers are very different from the average that we post. And at some point, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll start breaking that out, but not very this second. \nOperator: Our last question is from Reggie Smith of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nReggie Smith: I guess the biggest variance this quarter to my estimate was the interest income line. And I noticed or I\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters that your mix of interest bearing transactions of volume has been growing. My question for you, how common are prepayments in your business? And I ask that because I\u2019m trying to, I guess, get to the durability of that interest income. I know I think in quarters past, Mike has suggested that it took a while for the rates to kind of bleed in. It looks like we\u2019re seeing that now. So I\u2019m just trying to figure out the durability there.\nMichael Linford: Yes. Prepayments in our business are common. They\u2019re understood price into all of our capital deals. And for the record, we think a good thing. Max mentioned this before. We think about consumer exposure as a real limiter. And if a consumer prepays that it\u2019s an opportunity for us transact with them again and that\u2019s a good thing for us. It\u2019s a really healthy sign. I said differently, the prepayment for risk for us is not really a risk versus the credit risk in the business. And so, we don\u2019t view prepayments as really a problem at all. I think a thing to remember about the product is just how short the duration is. And so prepayment risk in other asset classes is a real important thing especially in a declining rate environment, given the long-term nature of those loans, but the way that to realize here is so fast that it\u2019s really difficult for us to have a meaningful amount of the economics eroding or the interest income going away, so long as the originations are still there, right? So that\u2019s the more important variable in terms of what we can generate, it\u2019s not just the back book for us.\nReggie Smith: So I guess the punch line is that that yield is pretty durable going forward as long as you continue to originate. Is that the right way to think about it? \nMichael Linford: You got it. Yes.\nMax Levchin: Lots of little loans spitting off pretty nice rates, but not -- we don\u2019t suffer from, oh my God, we just lost 29 years of interest, like nothing of this sort of applicable here.\nMax Levchin: And yes, I think it\u2019s worth pointing out that, I think what you saw in the past year was this rate shock hitting the business and there being a few quarters of depressed asset yield and you\u2019ve seen us recover from it. So the business model isn\u2019t one that is completely impervious in the short-term to these kinds of shocks. But over the medium term, we\u2019re able to really get the yield back in the asset, get the execution of the capital markets to a level to where we can continue to scale the business, like we want.\nReggie Smith: Perfect. We\u2019ve gone an hour, so I\u2019m not going to hold you guys any longer. I guess we can catch up on the call back. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMichael Linford: Thanks, Reggie.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions in the question queue. And I would like to turn the call back to Zane Keller for some closing remarks. \nZane Keller: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. And we look forward to speaking with you again next week at our investor forum. See you there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes today\u2019s event, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Max Levchin",
            "content": "Thank you, Zane. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I keep it very brief. We had a very strong fiscal Q1, exceeded our outlook across all metrics. GMV growth accelerated sequentially. We significantly exceeded our own outlook for revenue less transaction costs. We continued to gain market share, kept our already strong economics quite good, drove positive credit outcomes, which matters to us the most, and added some funding capacity. Our plans now include continuing to invest in risk management, technology and product development, and to turn our attention to growing Affirm faster. Back to you, Zane. I think, I\u2019ll take the why the growth. I think we\u2019ve just been executing really well. As you saw just the overall operating leverage, we are firing in all pistons of the Company, which it feels very good. We\u2019re able to deliver a couple of really key initiatives on the product side. Our friends in Ottawa, in particular, we had several really strong ideas that played out very well for us there. And so Shopify volume accelerated again, which sort of speaks to maybe the way we operate the business. It sometimes seems like you signed a great partner and that\u2019s the burst of volume. But in reality, it takes us years to fully realize the opportunity for us when partnerships are this rich and with this much potential. So that\u2019s one example. Card grew quite well as well and so we\u2019re happy with those results. There\u2019s not one thing that I can stick a finger at and say that this is the core reason for the GMV growth. But the other thing is that the demand for the product remains strong. We are still declining quite a number of applicants, because we\u2019re trying to remain as thoughtful and productive in our credit outcomes, but the consumer demand for what we have to offer is continuing to pull it forward. I\u2019m known to give long winded answers, so I\u2019ll actually try to keep this one shorter. The very short hand answer is optimization. Both companies are very numerically driven. We spend an incredible amount of energy just EV testing, various forms of presentation of the products we offer to consumers, try to simplify things, try to fine-tune everything from how do we explain interest if there\u2019s interest to pay. How do we make sure people understand that there is no interest in products like paying for. Just all of that. And if you have a -- one of the sort of obvious truisms if you will is if you have a significant amount of volume already, even 1% or 2% increase in end to end conversion just creates millions or tens of millions of dollars of incremental GMV. So it\u2019s never a -- sometimes it is sort of a brilliant unlock where we say, oh, we forgot this thing we can try and it works, but 9 out of 10 times it\u2019s really just optimizing existing consumer experience, finding ways of presenting the offer a little bit more up funnel so consumer understands there is a budget perhaps more than the budget they realize because we can tell them here\u2019s what we are willing to approve you for et cetera. And then, just doing that over and over again has compounding effects. So, there\u2019s not a -- the secret sauce is in the work, not in secret. So I don\u2019t want to steal too much of Libor\u2019s show next week, to quote my favorite movie, I\u2019d love all of you to come and give me notes when we do investor forum a week from now. But the shorthand is, the mix remained largely in line with what we said last quarter. It\u2019s still more split pay -- or split transactions versus paid in full. We\u2019ll talk a lot about things like cohort retention and usage over time and a little bit about lifetime value next week. So, there\u2019s a lot to share, and I don\u2019t want spoil the party too much. The growth is quite strong. It is managed to the number that we want. We have internal goals that we are driving card numbers to. We won\u2019t run out of opportunities there for some time. We also want to make sure that we don\u2019t paint ourselves into a corner in the following sense. The product is a new idea. This is not something that existed before. We have lots of intellectual property protection around some of the stuff that we invented both kind of what meets the eye and what\u2019s under the hood there. And every time you launch a new product, even if it has exceptional uptake, which we think this one does, you are educating a consumer. You have to look for long-term effects. Like, one of my many nighttime jobs is to read consumer feedback that comes to me directly from the card and it\u2019s now a very steady stream of content. And a lot of it is about sort of getting in touch with our PMs and saying, hey, there\u2019s this wrinkle on the card that people still don\u2019t fully understand, how do we fix this? Again, so in service of that, let\u2019s get 3% more conversion, let\u2019s get 5% more conversion. The card is so new, every time we find some major comprehension unlock, we find ourselves in another 10% gain. So, it\u2019s gratifying to unblock -- fix a mistake we made or unblock a comprehension detail and suddenly lot more volume. So, we\u2019ll continue growing users quite deliberately. We\u2019ll be very, very focused on unblocking all the quirks of these interface, doing all the educating that we have to do before we start sending a card to everybody as they sign up. But over the long period of time, I fully expect to get to a place that is, hey, welcome to Affirm, the card\u2019s in the mail. That\u2019s not going to happen anytime in the immediate or even foreseeable future. But the long-term point of the card is, it is the best way of experiencing Affirm. We will build all of our product roadmaps on this idea of you should have this card, it is the best thing ever and you should just have one of these, even if you\u2019ve transacted with Affirm for the first time yesterday. Thank you, Dan. We are very proud too, but I really appreciate hearing that. The team works very hard. I know a bunch of Affirm folks are listening. You nailed it this quarter. Thank you for your hard work. The B2B thing that we started showing is certainly not a one-off. In fact, when we start reviewing the opportunity, my ask to the team was please come back to me with a plan of what this looks like in a market, sort of what\u2019s the true opportunity across many, many possible platforms, not just one. So yes, you should expect us to do more. Obviously, we will speak to it when we\u2019re good and ready. The current product as you see it today is for sole proprietorships. And it\u2019s this interesting space where the efficiency of the lending market to that user is really, really poor. And so, as a result, the consumer typically borrows money either on their personal financial devices, which is just for a variety of reasons a bad idea, or through all kinds of just unoptimized old school sort of 19th century lending platforms. And there\u2019s no reason why that should be this way, given our expertise and underwriting, in particular underwriting consumers. So expanding our models to small, very small full proprietorship type business underwriting was not a huge challenge. The actual work began something like more than a year ago where we primarily just tested will our underwriting work as well as it does in consumer if we expanded it to very small businesses. And obviously, we feel confident enough to start rolling it out with the largest e-commerce player. So, feel very positive about it. We\u2019ll be very deliberate. It\u2019s a new business for us. Nothing is -- we will not do anything that damages our stellar credit performance. That\u2019s certainly, as always job number one, but exciting. There\u2019s lots of merchants that have very sizable side hustles, if you will, where they sell their goods or goods on their platform to sell props that either use them or resell them and they too need some honest financial services and here we are for that. A lot to go there. So, on the student loan, that\u2019s an easy one. So we said it for two quarters in a row before this one, we too got very seriously. Obviously, nobody had sort of real sense for exactly what it would look like. I gave Dan props last quarter because he really something that predicted pretty precisely what we thought would happen to student loan repayment, impact on our ability to approve people. And the point is we\u2019ve been looking at it for months and months and months and incorporated underwriting changes to make sure we are prepared for the student loan repayment resumption. At this point, they\u2019ve been effectively back, the obligations for a month and a little bit. We feel that we\u2019ve handled it really well. We can see it in our credit prints that it had no material impact on us. In fact, the slight increase that we saw was seasonality exactly as we predicted. So, we did a really good job preparing for that and largely think it\u2019s behind us. I think just more broadly, that has been our strength as a company. We take underwriting as the single most important thing we cannot make a mistake on. And we obsess over it. We look at all the metrics all the time. We call five alarm fires every time, some metric -- ever so slightly off to make sure that we know exactly why it is. And that\u2019s what has allowed us to maintain this level of performance in credit. I\u2019m not sure I agree that the economy has deteriorated. That\u2019s a very broad statement. There are definitely signs of stress going back as far as April of 2022. It\u2019s, generally speaking, for our consumer not been a dramatic change in their ability to pay their bills back because -- remains effectively fully employed. Obviously, the most recent unemployment numbers start to show some very modest cracks in the full employment number, but still very, very strong relative to what we would consider to be serious area of concern. And we tune our models to both internally sourced data of actual repayments and the macroeconomic inputs such as job prints is what we consider as we try to forecast the not very distant future. The reason we don\u2019t need to forecast the very distant future is because the terms of our loans are really, really short. So, we have to be right about what\u2019s going to happen to our consumer in the near-term much more than we have to predict the world economic future. As far as the BNPL popularity, we\u2019re certainly seeing a stronger demand as we had seen in points of time. It does help that we are the only player of scale that is willing to write monthly installment loans. The paying for was a pretty cool idea when it was all fun and games and zero interest rates to underwrite people for 6 months loan and 12 months loans, you have to be quite a bit more detail oriented and thoughtful in our modeling and that is our strength and the source of our overall superiority. We feel very good about our ability to continue performing in those loans as well as the shorter term stuff. It seems that offering the full spectra of products really does drive consumer preference, but obviously still a very, very competitive market and we\u2019re not going to declare victory just yet. But it does seem that the BNPL has remained a consumer favorite. Certainly, the Affirm version of BNPL remained a consumer favorite, given as the economic party may have gotten a little bit cooler. I\u2019ll start by reminding that decline for us is kind of the point of last resort. So, for a huge percentage of underwriting decisions, what we try to do and do pretty well is say, yes and, and is we need you to make a down-payment. We think that you should borrow, not $800 for example, but $600. And if you have [$200] to make a down-payment, that will be wonderful. And so that\u2019s just an important thing to keep in mind. So, when sort of -- we look at our approval rates, they\u2019ve largely remained broadly the same. Obviously between sort of groups of consumers if you stratify them by credit, they generally remain the same. But by definition, the credit mix, the input mix has not really changed all that much. So very broadly, the answer is no, we\u2019re not seeing anything dramatic. The one thing that\u2019s really -- that we have to mention, so we said it last quarter that we\u2019re on track to broadened our EPR range from 0% to 36%. Obviously before we were between 0% and 30% as we broadened it to 36%. The natural consequence of that is we\u2019re able to approve a little bit more books. And that is a great tool to have. Obviously, the number one job that we have vis-\u00e0-vis consumers is to offer them access to credit in a transparent fairly priced way. Having a wider range of prices available to us does allow us to say yes to more people. So, all these to people -- you\u2019ll see us probably on the margin be slightly more approveful, if that\u2019s a new word. I made that up. I thought I\u2019d start a word go. But, being able to price the risk in allows us to say yes more often. Yes. So we\u2019ve always viewed them as one of our key regulators. I\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time on their advisory board a few years ago, so on. So obviously being subject to supervision from our point of view is a formalization of the relationship between Affirm and bureau. We think we may be somewhat unique in this, but we think it\u2019s a positive step for the industry, most importantly, sort of normalizes the engagement with the regulatory bodies. It\u2019s also good for consumers for obvious reasons and good for us because we think it levels the playing field in quite a number of centers. We\u2019ve been in contact with the bureau for a long, long time and certainly expect to continue being engaged with them. Our priorities remain exactly what they have been. We are everything, if not transparent and clear with the end borrower and that certainly aligns very well with the mission of the bureau. So, I feel -- generally speaking, feel quite good about the regulatory engagement. It\u2019s more rational now than it was before. I wouldn\u2019t call it fully rational just yet. I think it\u2019s harder -- with every passing moment, so long as we agree that the overall economic reality is not on a positive direction. And as I said in a previous question, we have not seen sort of a dramatic turn for the worse, but we are very, very active in managing credit. It is a competitive advantage for us and I think, if I\u2019m completely honest, it\u2019s a bit of a soft spot for some of the competition. And so, what this does to merchants, if our competitors are rational, is they have to tighten approval dramatically. They can\u2019t separate risk as well as we can. The only way to not have losses is just decline indiscriminately a lot more. Our strength is ability to separate good and bad risk and therefore we can maintain high approvals. That has served us really, really well over the years. There\u2019s lots of stories to tell from the earliest days of Affirm where some extremely valuable logo merchant would come to us and say well, the competitor of your just showed up and they offered us half the price, so we\u2019re going to clue you and go there. And during those times, I would sort of stress and worry that this means everything is broken about this company, and we always maintained with much urging and occasional head slapping from Michael. We maintained a discipline of saying, look, if this is an irrational deal, we will not sign it. And most often those merchants would come back to us and say, actually the weirdest thing happened, we are paying a much lower price, but the approvals suck. And it\u2019s not an accident. If you are good at managing risk, you know how to price it, and if you know how to price it, you can then deliver it at a fair price to both the consumer and the merchant. And so, as it becomes a little bit harder or for some folks obviously a lot harder to underwrite, it\u2019s a little bit easier to prove to our partners that being rational on a pricing side is really important. So, this conversation will become a little bit easier. To sort of break it down even more and I promise I\u2019ll stop in a second, but it\u2019s an obviously super important topic that I spent a fair amount of time on. The thing that really becomes interesting is you talk to folks that run these merchant companies and some of them are still very, very focused on bottom line, others are on top line, and sometimes it\u2019s a function of having inventory, sometimes it\u2019s a function of trying to meet growth targets for investing purposes. Depending on that, their goals change. And the thing that we\u2019re really, really good at is tuning financial offers for consumers to meet merchants\u2019 financial targets. If they are if the merchant is very focused on driving inventory out of the warehouse or off their virtual shelves, we\u2019re very good at creating consumer offers at no APR, fixed low APR that we can dynamically price for the merchant and the consumer and make those transactions happen. If the merchant is very focused on their own bottom line, we\u2019re very comfortable working with them to reduce or to drive their MDRs down to make sure that their costs are under huge degree of control and passing the cost on to the consumer. Because we are so transparent with pricing to both sides, it\u2019s never a mystery and never this sort of a black box negotiation where everybody feels like they\u2019ve been somehow hurt by this whole process. We\u2019re very, very clear with our merchants. Here\u2019s exactly what you can get in the current environment with the current approvals. And over the years, that\u2019s built a reputation for us that just worked time and time again. And so, the conversations have always been rational with the merchants that we have and that\u2019s why you see our MDRs quite stable and our merchant base quite well retained. You must have been spying on our conversation with Michael yesterday. Jokes aside. Yes, the short answer is absolutely, we\u2019ve been caged in this e-commerce cage for a very long time and feel very good about our -- breaking out into the bigger wide open commerce space writ large. Affirm works pretty well in store if the merchant is cooperating. So depending on where you go you\u2019ll find us in a kiosk, you will find us on your phone, but speaking to the phone of a store associate. There\u2019s a bunch of modalities that we\u2019ve developed over the years. And they all work fairly well for existing users. And if the merchant helps, they can even help us with user acquisition. The card just supercharges this thing like a totally different level. Again, I\u2019m going to bite my tongue on some of the cool stats, I think we\u2019re going to show off next week, but we\u2019ll talk a little bit about the success we\u2019re seeing offline with the card. But even beyond that, we do think that there\u2019s work to be done, ideas to be tried offline, even before the consumer gets the card, and that\u2019s a pretty exciting thing. At this point, as Michael put it yesterday, Wi-Fi or cell coverage in a store next to a store to solve problem. And we do have a 80%-ish app download for existing users and a very, very high propensity to download our app just because the brand and the app reviews have been so strong. So feel very good about what we\u2019ll do offline. It is brick and mortar, which means that it moves a little bit slower, but the price is worth the effort. That\u2019s certainly a major part of the conversation. I think I sort of started answering this and Michael has a lot of opinion on this one, so I\u2019ll call him in a second. But the shorthand is it really depends on the merchant margin structure. If your overall world view is co-points to margin, lots of turns of inventory, you just don\u2019t have the margin capacity to drive these 0% deals unless the manufacturer is willing to contribute. And we\u2019ve sort of dropped the breadcrumbs of that idea for quite some time and obviously it\u2019s a massive sales and engineering effort where you\u2019re trying to tie more than just the consumer and the seller, but also consumer and the seller and a manufacturer or brand or some other third-party that wants to subsidize the interest. So, that\u2019s a fun design and engineering challenge, but we\u2019ve been making very, very steady progress. There\u2019s a sort of a point in my letter about what we internally call mixed carts, which I think I referenced as the ability to combine multiple financing programs. If you have a manufacturer or brand that\u2019s sponsoring a 0% deal, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a TV manufacturer and you\u2019re buying that TV and a bag of cookies and the cookies are not 0% sponsored, you have to be able to provide correct accounting for both sides of the transaction, but consumer think of it as a single basket. And so before we got to full distribution of the brand sponsor promotions as we call them, we have to deploy robust implementation of mixed cart accounting and sort of downstream transactional and capital markets work. So, that took us a fair amount of time and effort just to sign as to how complex some of this stuff can be. Now that we have that that live, we have a variety of really rich conversations around, hey, let\u2019s have a 0% promotion and no, you don\u2019t have to directly fund the EPR discount, Mr. Merchant. So that\u2019s one side of it. If your margin structure is, I got 60% gross margin and maybe a subscription to support future revenue streams, of course, you want to do 0% deals and that becomes a much, much easier conversation. So we have merchants of both kinds and everything in between. We work pretty closely with them. As the holidays roll along, people start becoming very concerned with driving inventory off the shelves, sometimes into the holidays, sometimes right after depending on sort of what they think will happen to them or what does happen to them around five days of sales around Thanksgiving, and so we\u2019ll certainly support all those, but a big part of who we are is we\u2019re fundamentally an engineering company, and so building these tools is what we enjoy the most. As we ship new tools, we immediately bring them to market to our merchant partners, offering them new ways of driving more sales. And so, we have quite a lot of fun stuff that we shipped in the last 60, 90 days and all of that will get deployed and into the holidays. That\u2019s definitely the star of the show next week. So, I\u2019ll give you a light preview versus the very wholesome presentation, which you should expect next week. Generally speaking, it\u2019s tracking two expectations. What you\u2019ll hear a bunch about next week is it\u2019s becoming a very clear journey where we are teaching consumers about a new product. When they just sign up for the cards -- so these are all repeat consumers. They\u2019re not -- we\u2019ve never spent a penny marketing the card. There\u2019s no big billboards over one-on-one or anything like that. It\u2019s just the card that you get if you like Affirm and we offer it to you and we -- we haven\u2019t pushed it particularly hard just yet. When you do get it, the first sort of comprehension hurdle is, hey, this is just like Affirm where I ask for a loan and I get approved and it works. But now it works, I can consummate the transaction with a card. So your first intellectual hurdle is, it\u2019s Affirm on a piece of plastic, that\u2019s cool. So, you can\u2019t expect that to become your daily spending instrument because Affirm today is for everything from dresses to fancy workout equipment, but it\u2019s not in your mind just yet for a cup of coffee. Over time you see folks slowly recognize that actually it\u2019s pretty cool. It provides some buyer protection, unlike your debit card. It has a bunch of really neat features like you can say, oh, this transaction is actually a little bit more than I wanted to spend. I can go back in time and split it, if that\u2019s appropriate. And so, as people understand all the functionality of the card, which is not something that they pick up in a day or two, it actually - we have a whole bunch of work that we put in. This quarter -- if you have used the card before, you kind of missed out on a whole bunch of really neat things that we shipped as a first time user experience through the whole pile of features helping people understand all the various things that are capable of. We start graduating people to more and more transactions and I\u2019ll bite my tongue on some of the really cool reveals. But we have -- so the tip of the spear the consumers that really get at how it works are tracking better than expectations. I\u2019m very, very excited about that group. And our job is really now taking the customer through, hey, this is Affirm card to -- this is actually something I could use instead of my debit card. It\u2019s good for everything and that\u2019s going really well. The card team will tell you that I occasionally message them in the middle of the night and mostly to find out that they\u2019re already working on the idea that I just had and I literally -- my last message in the slack channel to the car team, okay, okay, I\u2019ll get out of your hair, you have thought of everything. So I\u2019m very excited about how well we\u2019re going. Lots of work to do though. Definitely very, very far from done. Certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to comment on any one particular partner, although obviously we feel we\u2019ve done really well there. But if you look at share of cart, as we call it, in our largest partners, we\u2019re far from done. I refer you back to my -- one of my bragging points. Shopify partnership has been around for three years, and I think several folks in the analyst community have written that off as well. It\u2019s now stable and will grow some sort of a single digits slow grower because they\u2019re fully integrated now and yet the volume there keeps accelerating because both companies are excited to build new things and try to deliver more value to both merchants and consumers. So we certainly have a lot more room to grow in all of our very large partnerships. Frankly, I think we have a lot of room to grow in small ones as well. The large ones obviously pay off better because when you unlock something to the tune of 1%, you\u2019re playing with billions instead of millions. So feel very good about there -- about that. The companies are enormous. They have lots of conflicting priorities. And so, it will absolutely take longer than our average efforts, especially because -- the reason these companies chose us is because we are technologists and we build software really, really well. That means that majority of integrations are complex. If you\u2019re a tiny little company and you take our standard API and implement it and we bring you live. Literally, it can be done at this point in a self-service environment for small companies. That\u2019s pretty awesome, and I bragged about that in the letter as well. For a much larger partner, this is a real effort and it takes quarters to get it right and make sure all the plumbing works and scales and handles things like Prime Days, which are enormous spikes of volume. And so once that\u2019s there, deploying optimizations and changes and new initiatives is not a thing you can sort of flip a switch and see what happens. You have to follow the thoroughness and deliberate nature of such efforts, but when they do work, they are dramatic leads. And so we certainly have many more leads to take. Obviously, I\u2019m extremely biased, so sort of discount that appropriately. I do think the product we offer works better than credit cards, and credit cards are the dominant way to pay across all these merchants. We feel like we have lots more share to grab it. I certainly don\u2019t think you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree. It\u2019s something that I look at a lot. The way I think about it is every consumer has a certain amount of spend that they\u2019re doing today, some of it on credit, some of it from cash, we are competing for that. We are not trying to create new debts where there wasn\u2019t some because we are -- obviously we don\u2019t charge late fees, we don\u2019t compound interest, so we don\u2019t benefit from delinquency, we don\u2019t benefit from spending. We are very careful not to overextend our consumers. Part of the mission is to create healthier financial realities for our customers, not to push them into unsustainable spending. And so, we are trying to shift spending onto our instruments. Depending on kind of how far you cast your eye in the future of Affirm, obviously, first time transactions that number you\u2019re talking about will come down. As we get to more and more customers underwritten, by definition that number will start trending up. So I don\u2019t know if I have a -- the right number is 78.37. That\u2019s the perfect one, and -- not at all, I look at it as a indicator of where we are. The reality of new versus repeating users for us kind of a two sided coin if you will. New users are the highest risk loans we will write. When you have never transacted with a firm before, by definition we don\u2019t know you as well as we do someone who has transacted already. So, wherever we take a more careful risk stance and we have been in a relatively conservative one for quite some time, you can expect us to be deliberately careful with approving new consumers. On the other hand, we are very excited to take more and more share from our friends in the credit card world. And so, we are delighted when the frequency goes up which is in fact reflected in the percentage of transactions from repeat users. So, there are multiple vectors on this metric, not too obsessed with it. I care a lot more about overall GMV growth. Credit metrics obviously are absolutely paramount. Frequency of consumer is something that I look quite a lot about, although it\u2019s worth saying that at this point we see very clear stratification of consumers. People have chosen that Affirm is their primary spending device and those numbers are very different from the average that we post. And at some point, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll start breaking that out, but not very this second. Lots of little loans spitting off pretty nice rates, but not -- we don\u2019t suffer from, oh my God, we just lost 29 years of interest, like nothing of this sort of applicable here. And yes, I think it\u2019s worth pointing out that, I think what you saw in the past year was this rate shock hitting the business and there being a few quarters of depressed asset yield and you\u2019ve seen us recover from it. So the business model isn\u2019t one that is completely impervious in the short-term to these kinds of shocks. But over the medium term, we\u2019re able to really get the yield back in the asset, get the execution of the capital markets to a level to where we can continue to scale the business, like we want."

            "name": "Michael Linford",
            "content": "The only thing I\u2019d comment on for Q2 is, it\u2019s our largest quarter of the year. And so, we just have a lot more math in the comparable period. And we do expect that some of our programs, our largest enterprise partner programs are continuing to mature in a way that we just expect a little bit less growth this year than we had in the last quarter. Yes. The adjusted operating income did come in well ahead of where we thought it was going to be for the quarter. And I think it shows the power of us and our technology orientation. When we are able to control expenses and drive a little bit of extra growth, the growth and profitability is very, very strong. And to put it in context, we have 28% GMV growth or 37% revenue growth and our non-transaction operating expenses reduced on an absolute basis by $50 million year-on-year. When that happens, obviously, you can print pretty strong results. I think due to our outperformance, we did raise the outlook for the full year. We\u2019re now expecting closer to 5%. And I think that we were driving leverage really across all three lines, G&A, sales and marketing, and tech data and analytics. And those lines are all very leverageable in our business. We\u2019ve been saying this for quite some time. And yet that\u2019s also the area we invest in, primarily in human capital. We want to make sure we maintain the ability to invest in the back half of the year, which is why we wouldn\u2019t expect to run at this level. But no, there really wasn\u2019t any sort of timing benefit. We will expect sales and marketing to creep up a little bit in Q2 as we invest into the holiday season. But other than that, we feel like Q1 was very close to run rate before we again maintain some -- bring to make some investments in the back half of the year. Yes. We\u2019re really proud that we were towards the high end of our long-term range in a quarter when we were obviously up against substantially lower rate environment, and we feel like we\u2019re settling into the higher for longer. I think there\u2019s maybe two things to call out. The first is that we\u2019ve done a really good job of making sure our assets have the right economic content in them. In our letter, we do plot what the yield of our asset is and also where our funding costs have gone. And you can see that, certainly you\u2019ll see a pretty big inflection towards the end on the Affirm asset yield, and that\u2019s a reflection of our pricing initiatives but also the really strong credit controls that we\u2019ve had place over the past year. And it all starts there, you got to get the asset yield right, but then the second piece is really important is we\u2019ve been executing really well in the capital markets. We have added forward flow partners to the mix, which of course helps the imperative earning power as you can sell loans and earn the gain on sale, which is really important for us to do. And maybe notably is that the percentage of loans sold in our first quarter was more in line with the historical averages than we had been in the prior quarter, which was a pretty depressed level. And so, what you\u2019re seeing is the benefit of the improvement to the asset yield and the benefit of the capital markets execution, which in turn is a benefit of the discipline that we\u2019ve had on the asset yield, right? Those two things are very much linked. And you\u2019re seeing it really shine right now where our engagement with capital markets partners is really positive. Max mentioned that we went and saw many folks over the past couple of months, and the discipline that we\u2019ve had is really giving us credit there. And so, that\u2019s what gives us confidence that this rate environment is one that we can operate well in. We\u2019ve done the work to get the asset yields that they need to be. We\u2019re getting credit for it in the capital market. And our focus is really around, at this point, continuing to scale the network, we\u2019ve earned the right to do that. No, we\u2019re really not. So as per the usual, we try to hold what we\u2019re seeing right now when we provide our guidance. And we don\u2019t really assume things are going to get materially better or worse because we really don\u2019t try to prognosticate too much about where the economy is going. We do see some positive trends right now. You\u2019re seeing categories that were real decliners over the couple of quarters returned to something that looks more like flat, certainly less decline. And we think that\u2019s a good healthy sign. And obviously, we still have exposure to some of the largest platforms in e-commerce, and that does -- that breadth of exposure allows us to get pretty wide category coverage. And so, the more operative question for us is, are consumers going to be out spending, and we certainly feel like the evidence is right now that they are. It\u2019s definitely not reactive, meaning things look worse. It\u2019s very mathematical for us. So, we make an estimate of the losses for all loans we have on the balance sheet at any point in time and we make sure that we have an allowance appropriate to support that. As you change the mix of on- and off-balance sheet a quarter-over-quarter, so the increase in sold loans does drive the math to be higher this period, given the fact that you\u2019re selling more early stage loans. And so, you naturally have a little bit of shift there. But we don\u2019t view that as a bad thing. It\u2019s certainly not a reflection of underlying credit performance. We think the underlying credit performance remains exactly where we\u2019d like it to be. And when we have the kind of unit economics that we have this quarter, which is really strong at the high end of our 3% to 4% range, obviously, we\u2019re very comfortable with the amount of provision needed to support the growth in allowance. A couple of things just to add. The market will continue to be competitive. This is a growing category for a reason. Consumers are seeking out alternatives. And so we expect the market to continue to be competitive. We expect to continue to be rational in the face of competitors who want to be less rational, but we expect competition. And then, to specifically answer your question around the pipeline, we don\u2019t disclose any pipeline stats, but we feel good about the level of commercial activity right now. There\u2019s lots of great conversations happening and we remain, in conversations today that we probably couldn\u2019t have had a few years ago given some of the irrationality. So, we think that\u2019s a good thing, but those are conversations in pipeline, so there\u2019s certainly nothing concrete there. The only thing I\u2019d add is, we have been intentional around introducing fixed APR offers. This is low APRs, I think 5% and 10% APR offers into the merchant base. And those serve, the same -- the promotional role that is 0% served in a 0% rate environment. And I think those have been well received and have consumed a lot. And then lastly, I just -- there\u2019s a merchant mix here that matters a lot in this conversation. The merchant platforms that are stealing the most right now have the most interest bearing mix. And I think that probably distorts the trend I think you\u2019re pulling on, which is a little bit below the surface and overwhelmed by just the mix across our merchant base. So as you sell less exercise bikes and you sell more general merchandise that those trends tend to play out that way. Yes. Prepayments in our business are common. They\u2019re understood price into all of our capital deals. And for the record, we think a good thing. Max mentioned this before. We think about consumer exposure as a real limiter. And if a consumer prepays that it\u2019s an opportunity for us transact with them again and that\u2019s a good thing for us. It\u2019s a really healthy sign. I said differently, the prepayment for risk for us is not really a risk versus the credit risk in the business. And so, we don\u2019t view prepayments as really a problem at all. I think a thing to remember about the product is just how short the duration is. And so prepayment risk in other asset classes is a real important thing especially in a declining rate environment, given the long-term nature of those loans, but the way that to realize here is so fast that it\u2019s really difficult for us to have a meaningful amount of the economics eroding or the interest income going away, so long as the originations are still there, right? So that\u2019s the more important variable in terms of what we can generate, it\u2019s not just the back book for us. You got it. Yes. Thanks, Reggie."
