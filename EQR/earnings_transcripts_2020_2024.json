At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMarty McKenna: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and outlook for 2021. Our feature speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release as well as a management presentation regarding our results and outlook are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I want to start by thanking all 2,700 of my Equity Residential colleagues across the country for their dedication in serving our 150,000 residents during a very difficult year. Your commitment and hard work at the company through 2020 and I know you are ready to drive our recovery in 2021. Today, I will start with some color on the current state of our business and its future prospects, then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide an operating update, and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide detail on our guidance expectations, and then we will take your questions. We also posted to our website at equityapartments.com a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations. Turning to the business, we are encouraged by the recovery in demand in all of our markets and especially, in our urban submarkets. In real estate, demand is the unsolvable problem. Without it no other economic factor matters and in our business, both urban and suburban, we see plenty of it. As noted in the presentation and release applications, net move in activity and occupancy have all turned upward, especially over the last 2 months. This positive trend, in spite of a worsening pandemic, and renewed shutdowns in our markets gives us even more of a cause for optimism. If demand is this strong now, we think that when the vaccines are more fully distributed and cities reopened, our business will really hum. The fact that this is likely to coincide with our traditional leasing season with its higher seasonal demand positions us especially well. Admittedly, though pricing remains weak, but there are signs of the beginnings of improvement. As we noted in the presentation, pricing trends have turned up over the past few months, led by our urban core markets of New York City, the city of San Francisco and the cities of Boston and Cambridge. We also see declining forward concessions. With occupancy firming and strong demand going into our busiest time of the year, we believe that we can recover considerable ground on the pricing side as 2021 plays out. While we see signs of recovery, our current results reflect the still challenging climate in many of our markets. You may remember that on prior calls, I made clear that the impact of lower rents and higher concessions in 2020 and currently, will take some time to fully manifest itself in our reported numbers. That impact arrived in the form of our fourth quarter 2020 same-store revenue results as we continue entering into new leases and renewing existing leases at lower rents, reflecting the post pandemic leasing climate as well as amortizing concessions from leases written in 2020. But just as our reported results lagged, our actual operating environment on the way down, they will also lag it on the way up. So, you should expect relatively weak same-store revenue results in the first half of 2021, with a marked improvement in our revenue numbers in the second half of the year as we benefit from improving pricing, higher occupancy and lower concessions plus easier post pandemic comparable periods.  The interplay of our expectations of increasing occupancy, pricing that is improving, but will be lower than last year\u2019s pricing until midyear or so, and the amortization of 2020 and \u201821 concessions creates considerable modeling complexity for us and for our investors and analysts. Because of this more complex picture than usual, we thought it was particularly important that we reinstate guidance to give investors a better idea of management\u2019s view of the year. Our guidance has a wider than usual range to account for the multitude of factors, both positive and negative, that may impact our business in 2021. While I certainly acknowledge that the pandemic has created unique challenges, Equity Residential same-store revenue growth, coming out of recessions, is typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on the continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other general economic conditions remain supportive. Turning to the long term, we believe that the fundamental factors that have long made Equity Residential an attractive place to invest your capital remain just as true now as before the pandemic. First, our capital is invested in markets that will continue to be the centers of the knowledge economy that drives the growth of this country, centers of innovation in technology, finance, entertainment, medicine and life sciences.  Even in the pandemic, we have seen announcements of new high-quality jobs in our urban centers like Amazon\u2019s announcement that it\u2019s putting 3,000 new technology and software development jobs in the Seaport District of Boston. And with the recent commencement of construction on Disney\u2019s new building in Hudson Square in New York, that will lead to a significant influx of new content creation and technology jobs. And while the remote work trend may change the number of days that we are in the office, we are, by our nature, social animals. Our need to interact with each other to create, to share ideas, to manage our businesses and to start new ones is not being met by meetings on a video screen. Second, we believe that the entertainment, cultural and social attractions that fill the great urban centers in which we operate will soon reopen, and will again prove to be magnets for affluent renters. We believe that many renters desire both the work proximity I just mentioned as well as easy access to the amazing entertainment, cultural and social opportunities our cities will provide once they are reopened. Not to mention the ability to live in an exciting, dynamic and diverse community. Our residents that live in our more urban properties do so because they value the lifestyle of our country\u2019s great urban centers. Third, we have a highly skilled affluent customer base, able to afford our rent and will accept future rent increases as conditions improve. Our residents are well employed in growing industries like technology, biotech and new media. Industries that we also think are less susceptible over time, the job loss from increasing waves of automation and offshoring. In the pandemic period, overall unemployment rose to almost 15% and is now around 6%, while job losses for those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or better, which is our target demographic, peaked at 8.4% and has now gone down to 3.8%. Our resident base proved its quality again in the fourth quarter as we collected 97% of our expected residential revenues. We think the quality of our customer base is, over the long haul, one of our greatest strengths. Fourth, the superior location and quality of our portfolio makes our properties attractive places for our residents to live, and it also makes our properties attractive places for private investors to invest their capital. This makes our properties liquid and appreciating over the long term. Capital has long been drawn to the higher quality properties we own, and that will continue to be the case, even in markets like New York and San Francisco once the pandemic abates. We also believe that the lower long-term capital spending required to maintain our properties and income stream compares favorably with that of older, lower quality apartment buildings. But our portfolio can always be improved and you should expect this to be more active recyclers of capital over the next few years. As I have said on prior calls, even before the pandemic, in order to create the most stable and growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are inclined to further diversify our portfolio in the higher end suburban locations in our current markets as well as into a few select new markets with favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and a growing affluent renter base. These affluent renters are found in abundance in our existing markets, but there are also increasing concentrations of them in denser suburbs near city centers of our existing markets and in places like Denver, which is a market we reentered in 2016.  You have seen us do this over the last few years as we have acquired properties in suburban Seattle and Washington DC, with strong resident demographics. We are looking hard at several other suburban assets as well as development and acquisition opportunities in Denver that we find appealing in long term. We will fund this by lowering our concentration of assets in city centers in our existing markets, and by exiting assets elsewhere that do not meet our return parameters. To close, we have the best team in the business, ready to maximize results when the pandemic ends and a sturdy balance sheet that gives us ample flexibility. We are tremendously optimistic about our company\u2019s future because we believe that the markets in which we operate will thrive when we get to the other side of this pandemic. And with the rollout of vaccines, we are on our way. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks Mark. So, 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business, so let me start by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through 2020 by serving our customers, taking care of each other and driving the best results possible given the circumstances. Despite the challenges, we are excited that 2020 is behind us and optimistic that 2021 will be a year of recovery. As Mark mentioned, we have begun to see improvements in both physical occupancy and pricing. Notably, this is the first time this has occurred since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to test price sensitivity in many markets by reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted and beginning to raise rates.  In November, concessions averaged just over 6 weeks free on about 45% of our applications. In recent weeks, concessions have averaged just under 6 weeks on only about one-third of our applications. All that said, it will take some time to fully recover from the unprecedented events that have occurred, particularly in our hardest hit markets. While we are optimistic about the recovery, it is hard to handicap its pace, especially in New York and San Francisco, our hardest hit cities. On Page 3 of the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics broken out by our urban core, urban other and suburban portfolios. I will not walk through all the specific metrics in the presentation, but I do want to highlight some of the performance indicators we remain focused on. So first, demand, demand continues to be robust and has carried us through much of the winter season with increased move-in activity well above seasonal norms. Application counts exceeded 2019 levels by 25% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to generate sufficient front door activity to have move-ins outpace move-outs despite higher turnover compared to the 2019 record low level. We haven\u2019t seen this net gain in move-ins since the onset of the pandemic. Applications have remained robust in January, albeit below December\u2019s levels, but that isn\u2019t surprising since improved occupancy has allowed us to start testing pricing, and we have fewer units available to sell. Turning to pricing, the chart on pricing trend, which includes the impact on concessions, is a good indicator of where rents are headed, and it has been improving across both the urban and suburban markets for the last 8 weeks or so. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved, will continue to be negative for some time as this metric compares new leases written or renewed with those that were before the pandemic began. That said, the rate of change of blended rates has flattened. And for the first time, we have seen modest sequential improvement in new lease rates, which is helpful. We continue to experience negotiation pressure on renewal rates and we are still renewing residents who signed leases pre-pandemic. We have found some stability in the percent of residents renewing, which stands at approximately 52% in January. We expect that to improve to around 54% for February and March, which is still below our usual retention rates for this time of year. Before moving to market commentary, I want to summarize that while the operating environment remains challenging, we continue to see good demand for our product, and we are starting to see early signs of pricing improvement. We have a long way to go, but recovery is in sight. Now, let me provide some brief market commentary. Starting with Boston, strong application volume and improved retention through the fourth quarter resulted in steady gains in occupancy to position us to 95.5% today. This market has been dialing back concession use and raising rates consecutively for the past 4 weeks. At present, concessions are being used on about 25% to 30% of our applications and averaging right at 6 weeks, which is compared to 50% used back in November. Going forward, we expect modest improvement in rates, but acknowledge that a full recovery will require additional demand drivers, like the Amazon jobs Mark mentioned in his remarks, to aid in the absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated through the year. Long-term demand drivers remain positive, with a very bullish outlook for biotech and pharma space, fueling job creation. At this point, it is hard to forecast exactly how some of the traditional demand drivers associated with Boston play out, notably students, both domestic and international, and the jobs that support that infrastructure. We expect to have a better view on these by late spring, early summer before the fall semester. Anecdotally, I will tell you that January did see a few applications from foreign addresses, which we haven\u2019t seen for several months. Boston will have its challenges in \u201821, but its performance over the last 2 months has definitely improved. In 2021, we look to regain more occupancy, which will allow us to then recapture some of the rate we lost last year. New York continues to feel the outsized impact from the pandemic, but there are early signs of recovery. We recently had our best traffic week in the last 12 months and our best leasing week since August. Leasing activity is still driven by deal seekers and intracity movers, which is running about 10 points higher than normal. We still see move-outs to the suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut, but that number is normalizing. Occupancy has improved in the market and is just above 91.5%, which is the first time we have been over 90% since September of 2020. Some additional color on recent traffic includes that we are just now starting to have former residents reaching out to our property teams, contemplating moving back to the city. Like in Boston, we are seeing the first signs of international students and specific to New York, UN workers looking to come back. And finally, we saw a few roommate type prospects emerging from their parents\u2019 basements. Many of these prospects are looking for late spring or early summer time frames in anticipation of their offices opening back up. We still see a good amount of deal hoppers and upgraders as well as prospects from the outer boroughs who can now afford to live in Manhattan, and many of them are telling our on-site teams, they think the market bottom is near, and they don\u2019t want to miss out. Concessions remain prevalent in this market with 70% of the applications receiving about 2 months free. Rates are beginning to show signs of improvement, and we are just starting to gradually dial back concessions. For 2021, our focus in New York will be recapturing as much of the occupancy rate as possible while lowering and possibly eliminating the use of concessions. While the market will still produce a negative decline for the year, New York has upside potential given the dramatic declines we saw in 2020. Recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply, the return to office and the continued growth of the big tech employers in the market. Moving to DC, which has been our most resilient market on the East Coast, occupancy remained solid at 95.5%, but the market continues to feel the impact from the delivery of Class A multifamily product, which is not being absorbed as efficiently in previous years. Federal government employment has grown, but the overall job growth has declined. Concession use was up in the quarter with the largest amount focused in the district. The good news, however, is that as fast as concessions came into the market during the fourth quarter, they have now been greatly reduced. Since mid-December, we are only using concessions on 15% of the applications, and they\u2019ve been averaging just below 1 month. 2021 will be focused on balancing occupancy and rate as we face supply pressure from yet another 12,000 units being delivered into the market. Recent signs of improvement provide us more confidence in the market\u2019s ability to absorb the new units and allow for continued rate recovery, which could make DC one of our better performing markets in 2021. Heading West, Denver, albeit a small portfolio for us, is holding up well. For 2021, all 5 of our Denver communities will be included in the same-store results. Occupancy is sitting around 96%, and both new lease change and renewal rates are improving. Renewals are showing positive growth rates in December and January and concession use is trending down. In Seattle, we are seeing early indications that the bottom may be behind us. Occupancy continues to improve as traffic is up over January 2020 by about 6%, and we are seeing weekly application numbers that are closer to peak leasing season levels. Concessions remained common in the market, especially in the urban submarkets. During the fourth quarter, concessions averaged about 6 weeks free on about 55% of our applications. Strength in occupancy, both at our properties and more generally, in the overall market, are allowing for a gradual reduction in concessions. We have heard from our Seattle teams that many prospects seem less concerned about the monthly rate right now as they are about getting a deal. While current rent freeze restrictions may limit renewal performance in the first half of the year, overall fundamentals for this market support a recovery. Recent home price appreciation and the increase in this quarter\u2019s job postings from the technology companies should continue to drive strong demand for our product. The focus in Seattle in 2021 is maintaining the strong occupancy we currently have while pushing rate. San Francisco remains our most challenged market. But even here, there are some very early signs of recovery. Occupancy is just below 94% and has improved 150 basis points since the beginning of November. The downtown portfolio remains pressured on rate with concessions that averaged 6 weeks in the quarter on about two-thirds of our applications. January concessions improved to a 1-month average on less than half the applications. Anecdotally, stories from our teams across the bay are reporting that people who left to go to other areas like Denver and Sacramento, are now looking to move back to be near their office or in desirable school districts. The extent of the Bay Area recovery will improve as we get even more clarity on tech company\u2019s plans regarding return to office. We acknowledge that work from home will play a role, but we believe that in-person collaboration and much lower rent levels should make San Francisco attractive again. There have been headlines about corporate relocations out of state and clearly that is not a positive for the market, but it is important to keep reading. The Bay Area continues to attract venture capital and is yet to be replaced as the epicenter of the tech economy. Bay Area tech companies are also feeling a bit more optimistic and their ability to receive H1B visas under the new administration, which could increase demand in this market. Supply in \u201821 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and in the South Bay. Feedback from our local team was that the recent lifting of the stay in home order can definitely be felt in the downtown market with much more active streets and outdoor restaurant seating filled to the new lower allowed capacity levels. These are the first signs of bringing life back to the city. Our focus in San Francisco in \u201821 is to build back our occupancy, particularly in the downtown submarket, get rid of concessions and then push rate. While San Francisco will produce a revenue decline in \u201821, it, like New York, has a lot of upside potential due to the steep decline in 2020. Finally, moving to Southern California, which continues to hold up much better than the Bay Area, despite some pretty difficult pandemic-related headlines in the LA area our Los Angeles portfolio maintained occupancy above 95% through the quarter. Concession use was modest and averaged just under 1 month on about 20% of our applications. Operationally, the story is similar to the third quarter with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown Korea Mid Wilshire corridor. West LA continues to feel the pressure from the slow restart of online content creation, but new lease and renewal rates have shown some stability through the fourth quarter and into January. The suburban portfolio has very strong occupancy at or near 97%, and the submarkets of Inland Empire, Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County continued to experience modest year-over-year gains in rental income. For \u201821, L.A. should be one of our better markets. We have recaptured our occupancy. Concession use has already been dialed back and now, our opportunity is on increasing rate and managing delinquency. I will finish with Orange County in San Diego, which are primarily suburban markets for us and have averaged around 97% occupancy through the quarter. These markets continue to demonstrate resilience and produced higher resident retention than in any of our other markets. Both of these markets are presenting opportunities to increase rates and are expected to continue to perform well through 2021. In closing, we remain optimistic that the early signs of recovery that we now see will continue and that through \u201821, we will build occupancy on the back of strong demand, leading to improved pricing power. Our efforts over the next several months will be focused on seeking out opportunities to maximize the trade-off between rate and occupancy, while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana.\nBob Garechana: Thanks, Michael. This morning, I will focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A. As part of the release and management presentation published last night, we introduced 2021 guidance after having withdrawn guidance in March 2020 due to significant uncertainties arising from the pandemic. In doing so, we acknowledge how far we progress toward the end of this pandemic, but also recognize that a significant amount of uncertainty remains. As a result, our same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO ranges are wider than normal. Let\u2019s start with our full year 2021 total same-store revenue guidance range, which is between negative 9% and negative 7%. Note that this guidance is on a GAAP basis since we report same-store revenues in the same manner and include the straight-lining of concessions as required. In our management presentation, we laid out a variety of scenarios under which we could achieve the top, bottom or points in between. That said, let me take a moment and highlight the main drivers that will shape revenue performance for the year, along with our thoughts on how 2021 might play out. First, physical occupancy, you heard both Mark and Michael talk about the improvements we are already seeing. We would expect this to continue and that as we get into the second quarter, occupancy should become a tailwind that begins to contribute to year-over-year improvement. Next, pricing, much like occupancy, the middle and higher ends of our guidance anticipate the pricing improvements discussed to continue both in improved leasing rates and reduced concessions. This positive trend, however, will take a little longer to manifest itself in our reported numbers. For leasing rates, it will take some time, not only to start writing new leases and renewing existing ones at levels above the prior year, but also to reset a meaningful part of the leasing book. The good news is that not only are we starting to see improving trends, these improvements may gain even more traction in time to coincide with our prime leasing season and resulting in positive year-over-year rates by midyear. The other element of pricing that is worth touching base upon is concessions. As I mentioned earlier, we recognized concessions on a straight-line basis as required by GAAP. That means as disclosed on Page 12 of the release, of the $31 million in cash residential concessions granted in 2020, we still have approximately $19 million of unamortized concessions that will reduce revenue in 2021, which is about 75 basis points of same-store revenue. Any new concessions granted in 2021 will also be straight lined. So the earlier in the year that the concession is granted, the more of it that will be recognized in the 2021 financial statements. We expect concessions granted will taper off during the first half of the year. But because of the combination that I just described, 2020 unamortized residuals and the timing of new 2021 concessions, this improvement won\u2019t fully manifest itself in 2021 reported GAAP results. And finally, some thoughts on bad debt, as Mark mentioned, our collections have remained both strong and consistent at approximately 97%. We incurred an approximately $13 million reduction in revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 due to uncollected rent. The middle range of our 2021 guidance assumes that this continues with only slight improvement very late in the year. We hope that we can do better than that. But given the regulatory environment, we remain cautious in our assumptions. In summary, our same-store revenue guidance incorporates recovery and operating fundamentals, but acknowledges both difficult comparable periods for the first half of 2020 and the reality that it will take time for improvements in the business to show up in our reported results. Specifically, same-store revenue performance will be sequentially negative from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 and likely not improve until the second half of the year. As fundamentals improve, consistent with our expectations, reported results will catch-up from this improvement and benefit both sequentially and from a year-over-year comparison basis. We expect same-store revenue results in the second half of the year to be better than the first half results and to position us very well for continued growth and recovery. Now some color on same-store expenses. Our full year guidance range for same-store expenses is 3% to 4%. The drivers of same-store expenses remain largely unchanged. The 4 largest expense categories continue to be real estate taxes, on-site payroll, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Before I provide you a bit of color on each, I\u2019d like to remind you that 2020 will present a tough comparison period on expenses, given growth was only 2.1%. As you think about how this plays out quarterly, this comparison issue will especially be pronounced in the second quarter since many activities and corresponding expenses were halted in the first few months of the pandemic. Now, a little color on the major categories, real estate taxes are expected to grow in the mid-3% range, which is slightly lower than prior years. While municipalities continue to be stretched, we are seeing some jurisdictions provide relief on assessed values, and that, coupled with aggressive appeals activity, should help control growth. Perhaps even more pronounced this year than usual will be the timing and success of this appeals activity, which may present an outsized impact on where the number ultimately settles out. Payroll ended 2020 flat to 2019. This is the second year in a row that payroll growth has been less than 1%. And while many of our efficiency initiatives were delayed because of the pandemic, our hard-working on-site colleagues have continued to gain inefficiencies. As a result, 2020 makes for yet another difficult comparison for 2021. By continuing our efficiency initiatives and keeping our eye on the ball, we should still be able to limit payroll growth for the full year to around 2%. That leaves us with the final two categories of utilities and repairs and maintenance. Both are estimated to have more meaningful growth in the 4% to 5% range. In previous years, utilities benefited from modest or declining commodity price growth. In 2021, we are expecting higher natural gas prices which is driving our forecasted growth. For repairs and maintenance, a good amount of the growth encompasses catching up on activities that were delayed as a result of the pandemic, keeping in mind that this expense declined in 2020. Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2021 is $2.60 per share to $2.80 per share. Major drivers for the change between our 2020 normalized FFO of $3.26 per share and the midpoint of $2.70 from our 2021 guidance include: a $0.60 decline in same-store NOI based on the revenue and expense assumptions outlined. Keep in mind that nearly 1/3 of that decline stems from the difficult comparable period in the first quarter of 2020; a $0.07 decline primarily due to disposition activity that occurred in 2020, which is more than offset by a positive $0.14 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense, predominantly due to taking those disposition proceeds and paying down nearly $1 billion in debt in 2020; and finally, a negative $0.03 in other items. The back-loaded nature of the recovery in our NOI will also, of course, impact our NFFO numbers, which should improve on the back half of 2021. A final note on the balance sheet, our financial position remains extremely strong despite the impact of the pandemic. As I just mentioned, in 2020, we paid down nearly $1 billion of debt using disposition proceeds, extended our already long weighted average maturities to 9 years and continued to reduce our weighted average rate. This activity has positioned us extremely well, ending the year with net debt to normalized EBITDA of 5.0x, nearly $2 billion in available liquidity and very limited maturities until 2023. Our access to debt capital remains excellent positioning us well for opportunities should they present themselves. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to John Pawlowski of Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Great. Thanks. Maybe to start with you, Bob your opening comments there, did I hear it right that you\u2019re assuming positive year-over-year blended rates by midyear?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So our guidance assumption at the midpoint is that as you approach the middle part of the year that we will start to see positive year-over-year lease rates.\nJohn Pawlowski: And presumably, you are still decidedly negative on renewals. So that would assume decidedly positive on new lease, right, am I interpreting that correctly?\nBob Garechana: So when I guess I am talking about leasing rates in the guidance, I am thinking that we likely will be positive on blended which encompasses both by middle part of the year, encompasses both new lease and renewal rates.\nMark Parrell: John, just to add some color, it\u2019s Mark. Yes, just to add some color that will get your clarification in. That is partly because things are recovering and getting better, that\u2019s partly because the 2020 comp periods are declining, right. Rates declined and they declined particularly hard late in the second quarter and through the third. So, we look at this line as kind of crossing these two lines in the middle of the year. And I am sorry you were asking a clarification there?\nJohn Pawlowski: Yes. No, sorry to cut you off. But renewal rates through the year, beginning midyear, are they \u2013 are renewal rates positive still?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Hey, John, this is Michael. So I think the way to think about renewals is, first and foremost, we have a pretty difficult comp period in front of us with Q1 and Q2. And then as you turn that corner, you would expect performance and renewals to start turning positive.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thank you. And final one for me, Mark, your opening comments about just the liquidity of the assets and a more active capital recycler. Just curious your updated thoughts on urban Class A product along the coasts, if you are starting to test the market, how is pricing shaking out versus pre-COVID levels in some hard hit markets?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks, John. So, in terms of values and let\u2019s focus for just a moment on the hardest hit markets of New York and San Francisco. I start by saying there has just been very little \u2013 and you know there is very little volume, much, much less. In fact, we can sort of name the deals, the Chief Investment Officer and I that have closed. The ones that have closed, and there\u2019s one in Union Square in New York that closed right about what pre-pandemic values would have been. So that\u2019s an asset that I think was about $1,200 a foot, $900,000 a unit, at like a 3.6% tax cap rate \u2013 excuse me, very much value would have traded at before the pandemic, but it\u2019s just one deal. And I don\u2019t have a lot of others. In San Francisco, there is certainly been some stuff traded, smaller deals. I would say we\u2019re probably down 10% or so on value in San Francisco and New York. We are starting to hear from people who want to acquire assets from us in those markets. The thought being, they will ride the recovery up. We get that, and we probably \u2013 our sellers, as I implied in my remarks in those markets to some extent. Remember, we still have those 421a assets in New York that have the big tax increases. We have a big concentration in the city of San Francisco. But for us to sell much below the pre-pandemic value, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense because we believe in the recovery in those markets. So we think revenues are going up pretty sharply, especially in the second half of this year and into \u201822. And the idea that we would sell at a big discount doesn\u2019t make sense to me, but I think you will see us start to be more active sellers in those two places. Other places like Seattle, particularly has had a spade of sales, including a pretty large one in Bellevue, at very good pricing at pre-pandemic value or maybe even better, obviously, lower cap rates because NOI is down. So Seattle has had some strong numbers. DC too, a lot of suburban stuffs traded or a fair number of suburban things have traded. So we see that as market is holding up. I haven\u2019t seen a lot of urban stuff traded. There is some rules in DC that have come in the force that make it hard in a district to sell assets right now. So I will pause there and I hope that\u2019s responsive.\nJohn Pawlowski: It is. Well, thanks for the time.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Nick Joseph of Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Mark, maybe just following up on that, as you look to the active recyclers over the next few years and think about these potential expansion markets, what sort of IRR differential are you underwriting between some of these assets that you maybe thinking of selling? Because as you mentioned, the values maybe down, but the growth maybe on a forward basis versus any assets that you are starting to look at or markets that you are starting to look at?\nMark Parrell: Well, we all are able to boil it down to the math, but there is a lot more to it than that. I \u2013 again, we have seen deals we have underwritten, for example in Denver lately that are 7 un-levered IRR deals, maybe even some high 6s. A lot of stuff we are selling might be 1% lower than that. But of course, the assumptions matter a lot and how do you think about your recovery in rents, which is so hard to peg as you know. So, we do think that what matters in moving our capital around is ending up in the place that risk-adjusted is best. And in some cases, some of the markets also have more political risk, other markets have more supply risk, and we just got to balance that out. So there we do see, obviously, a higher IRR in the stuff we are buying than the stuff we are selling. But a lot of stuff we are selling is interesting to the buyers because they are levering it up or they have got a renovation play or some other way they are juicing their IRR that we either don\u2019t believe in or can\u2019t underwrite. So, I guess that\u2019s how I would answer. It\u2019s kind of not as mathematical as just maybe it\u2019s 1% better.\nNick Joseph: No, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I appreciate all the commentary upfront and the presentation. And so as we look at the applications in the move-ins, particularly over the last 2 months, is there anything that you are seeing trends in terms of either the age or credit quality or rent to income levels relative to where you were a year ago at pre-pandemic?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So Nick, this is Michael. So really, we are not seeing any kind of material shifts when we look at those applications. So we\u2019ve looked at kind of rent as a percent of income. The portfolio has always averaged somewhere right around 19% for those move-ins in the fourth quarter, we were also right at 19%. What we did see a little bit happen is the range that we used to see as rent as a percent of income, used to be from 17% to 23%, with Seattle being the low at 17% and San Diego being the high at 23%. That range has expanded a little bit to 16% and 24%, but it\u2019s really a marginal shift in this stuff. So, from the demographic side no change in the average age of applicants coming in. The income, I guess, I would tell you, when you look at New York, you have got some affordability opportunities right now. So you\u2019re seeing average incomes coming down for applications in New York, but it\u2019s still well over $220,000 a year, and the ratio is still at like 18.5%. So actually, everything we have looked at right now would suggest that all of our new applicants and all of our new residents coming in, from an affordability, from a demographic standpoint, really kind of demonstrate their ability to pay as the markets start to reaccelerate and stay with us.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Rich Hightower of Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Yes, hey, good morning guys. Thanks for all the valuable color. You actually have answered most of my questions. But I just want to get a sense, maybe in a market like New York, is there anything embedded within the forecast that\u2019s related to sort of the spring home buying season just given, for the first time in a long time, the strength in sort of the Tri-State area housing market? And do you make any assumptions around some of those related move-outs or anything along traffic or demand that might be impacted by that?\nMichael Manelis: So Rich, this is Michael. I will just start off and say, just overall, when we have looked at the percent of residents moving to buy homes, again, this is one of those sets we really have not seen a difference. At a portfolio level, we\u2019re running just over 12.5% of residents moving out. When you go specific to New York, we really haven\u2019t seen any material change on that front at all. It\u2019s actually declined a little bit in the fourth quarter. So I think relative to our assumptions as we move forward, I think you heard in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re starting to see some improvement in the percent of residents renewing. So for the portfolio, we are expecting to be up at 54%. New York is still one of those markets that we are off \u2013 we are off what is normal for that market. So we\u2019re still sitting below 50%, and we should be up above 60%. And so I think our modeling and our assumptions going forward is that we start to see a little bit of improvement in our ability to retain those residents, but nothing specific to them, more of them moving out to go buy homes.\nMark Parrell: And Rich, it\u2019s Mark. Just to support Michael\u2019s comment. There isn\u2019t anything expressly in our guidance about increasing home purchases. Home portfolio was kind of designed not to have a lot of concerns about people moving out to buy homes. And as far as we can tell, that continues to be the case historically. Going forward, a lot of the renewals that Michael is thinking about now and a lot of these people that could elect to buy a home, these were people that renewed with us or least initially with us in the pandemic, I mean we are rolling into a period where everyone would have leased with us knowing what the situation was in New York and especially in March, April and May when it was particularly dire. So I would have thought that if they really were thinking home buying was absolutely at the top of their list, or disproportionately our population of renters thought that they already would have been in the suburbs. They already would have rented there in the hopes of buying. So I\u2019m guessing the homebuilding, home buying boom in the Tri-State area is not actually going to matter very much to us.\nRich Hightower: Got it. Thanks for the comments.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Rich.\nOperator: And we will move to our next question from Alua Askarbek of Bank of America.\nAlua Askarbek: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions today. I appreciate all the commentary this morning. It was really helpful. But I was wondering if you guys can talk a little bit more about the suburban submarkets. It looks like the renewals are still high, but they are trending behind 2019, early 2020 and the occupancy has diverged again. So I was just wondering where are those renters headed to, the ones that aren\u2019t renewing and does it kind of tie into your commentary that the renters are looking to come back to urban? Just trying to think about if there is a shift back to urban to suburban that we have been talking about for the past year?\nMark Parrell: Yes. So, I think it\u2019s a great question. And I think as we think about the forwarding address for residents that are leaving us, we still see a little bit of an elevated number in those that are leaving urban submarkets to go to suburban submarkets. When we think about our own suburban portfolio, I think a lot of what you\u2019re seeing right now, in the management presentation, a lot of that is just normal seasonality as to how the markets actually would react. And I think what we\u2019re seeing is we had strong demand, we maintained good occupancy throughout the year, and I think we\u2019re going to continue to do that with stability and start pushing rate and try to recover as much of the rate as we can in the suburban submarkets.\nAlua Askarbek: Okay, got it. Makes sense. And then I just have a question on lease breaks and just transfers in general. I know last quarter, you said that everything was still elevated, and that also came about from companies pushing back their start dates. But how did that trend in 4Q?\nMark Parrell: Yes. So in the fourth quarter, the lease breaks is still elevated kind of on a year-over-year basis. But we are starting to see kind of that percent and the numbers start coming back into norms. I think we peaked up in September at like 36%, and the fourth quarter is now kind of gradually coming back down. We\u2019d expect this number. I think we\u2019re at like 25%, we\u2019d expect this to be coming at somewhere around 20%.\nAlua Askarbek: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will move to our next question from Amanda Sweitzer of Baird.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I thought your comment on some San Francisco residents looking to move back from Sacramento and Denver were interesting, can you quantify the magnitude of that reverse migration either on an absolute basis or relative to how many residents left?\nMichael Manelis: So I think, first of all, those \u2013 like that\u2019s just the anecdotal statements that\u2019s coming to us. So the quantity is small, right? But every week, we\u2019re on the phone with our on-site teams, and we\u2019re just trying to get some color around the applications and where they were coming from. When we see the inflows, which is new applicants for San Francisco, 87% of all of our applications are coming to us from within the state of California, and 70% are coming from within that MSA. Both of these numbers are up about 10 points each. So you\u2019re still seeing that elevated kind of activity, which to us, is still that deal seeker, right? They\u2019re coming in, they\u2019re taking advantage of that price. So from the out migration in, those states, where people have left and are coming back, it\u2019s just starting to trickle in. It hasn\u2019t really manifested itself into a large enough percentage change. But I think the positive is, is that we haven\u2019t heard any of that for months. And now we\u2019re just now starting to hear that.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Yes, that\u2019s helpful color. And then following-up on some of your demographics comments, I know the percentage of your residents with children is still kind of a small piece of your overall portfolio. But have you seen a change in that percentage, either among your existing base or the applications you\u2019re seeing come in?\nMark Parrell: Yes, so about 10% of our residents have children living with them. We haven\u2019t seen a change in that trend. And part of that is, I mean, our portfolio hasn\u2019t changed. It still has a limited number of 3-bedroom units. It\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a fair number of one-bedrooms and studios. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that, Amanda, to change very much just because again, our portfolio is more suited to couples and a few roommate situations and some families, certainly, but it\u2019s just \u2013 it is like we added 3-bedroom units to the portfolio to make it more family-friendly in the last couple of quarters.\nAmanda Sweitzer: That makes sense. Thanks for the time.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to our next question from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Good morning. Mark, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are optimistic on a recovery in urban markets, just given the social and cultural aspects. But at the same time, you\u2019re looking to reduce your urban exposure. So can you just marry those two comments together? And also maybe quantify where you\u2019re looking to get your urban exposure to over time?\nMark Parrell: Great. Thanks for those questions, John. So, there is a surface inconsistency there. I mean what our overall strategic goal is, as I said, is to just have a growing and steadily growing dividend and cash flow of the business. And to do that, the management team, even before the pandemic and the Board, had decided that we were going to spread our capital again, into these dense suburban areas around our urban centers, while still maintaining a significant urban center presence and into a few new markets or renewed markets in the case of Denver. So that was the plan. We do think there\u2019s going to be a pretty good recovery in these urban centers, and we think 1 of 2 things is going to happen. We\u2019re either going to be able to sell those assets now with the buyer understanding that they\u2019re going to need to pay close to \u2013 close or at pre-pandemic value because they\u2019re almost certain, in our opinion, at least to obtain a pretty good increase in revenue over the next couple of years, or we are going to wait and our shareholders who have suffered with the downside of the reduction in the urban centers will get that benefit.  And then we\u2019ll sell a few of those assets later. So, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t believe in the urban centers, we\u2019ll stay over-weighted to them, but not this over-weighted. And in terms of exact numbers, we have 9 significant buildings in the city of San Francisco. That\u2019s probably more than we need to have, but exactly how many should leave or go, I\u2019m not sure. On the other hand, we did buy assets in the Bay Area. And we\u2019re thinking about developing a couple of deals. They\u2019re just more Peninsula or East Bay or just sort of spreading the capital out. You saw our development deal, John, that\u2019s sitting on the island just outside of Oakland. So you should just sort of expect a decline in the city of San Francisco and overall, California, just again, because of the concentrated political risk there. I don\u2019t have an order of magnitude to give you, but that\u2019s a source.  And New York composed predominantly at Brooklyn and Manhattan. Again, we have significant number, approaching 30 buildings in that area and to get rid of a few of those buildings at the right price. We are looking at a development deal in the tri-state area, we\u2019ve acquired in Jersey City over the last year or two. So, it\u2019s not like we are not interested in staying invested in the area. It\u2019s just spreading the money out a little bit. So, I guess I\u2019d have you stay tuned for the exact numbers, but you should expect a lessening in California, specifically the city of San Francisco and a lessening in New York provided pricing makes sense and an increase in a place like Denver and in some of these suburban places as well as maybe another couple of markets.\nJohn Kim: It sounds like you think the urbanization trends that has occurred in the last decade have peaked. Is that a fair characterization?\nMark Parrell: No. I think they\u2019re spreading out more. I think new places are urbanizing. I think New York will continue to be a great urban center and San Francisco will eventually recover. But I think places like Denver now have an urban center. It\u2019s not as dense as it needs to be, but it\u2019s attractive, and we have 3 buildings in Downtown Denver, and those are well occupied. So I guess I\u2019d say, I think the trend towards urbanization, I think, is inexorable over the whole world and in the United States. I think it gets thrown off kilter for temporary periods of time like the pandemic. I think what\u2019s going on in the United States is other places. And again, Denver is an example, Austin, Texas, start to become more dense and become more attractive for a variety of reasons. So there\u2019s just going to be more cities. I mean Seattle joined the party 15 years ago in regards to having a really significant downtown. So I just think some of these other cities are also densifying, but I don\u2019t believe that urbanization is going to end in the United States. I think it\u2019s just merely been interrupted.\nJohn Kim: Okay. I appreciate the insight. Thank you. I just had a follow-up question on your urban core operating metrics and the improvement in pricing that we\u2019ve seen, which is on Page 6 of your presentation. But I just wanted to clarify, the pricing trend that you\u2019re showing, this is base rents and not affected rents. Is that correct?\nMichael Manelis: This is base rent, but it includes \u2013 it\u2019s a net effective. So it includes the impact of the concession. So basically, if you scraped our website and you looked at every single one of our units, what we\u2019d be charging, it\u2019s the rent, the amenity, rent \u2013 amenitized rent and the impact of that concession.\nJohn Kim: Okay, thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, John.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there.\nMark Parrell: Good morning.\nHaendel St. Juste: I appreciate the color on asset pricing and your thoughts on your portfolio exposures. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about how new ground-up development fits in your thinking here with asset pricing very full in your footprint as you outlined and noticeably more optimistic today versus prior quarters? What\u2019s the current thinking here in development? Your peers, certainly, a number of the Sunbelt peers have been adding projects to their development pipeline in the quarter. You still have 3, 1 of which is in a JV. So curious if you\u2019re \u2013 sounds like you are more inclined based on your answer to a prior question. Are you just not finding the opportunities? The returns are not attractive enough yet. And maybe how much you would like to expand that pipeline, too?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks, Haendel. I appreciate that question. So, I think all three of our development deals that you now see in the supplementary disclosure are going to deliver this year. We\u2019ll certainly be in lease-up for some time. We\u2019ve been looking at a couple of deals. We started nothing in 2020. That just didn\u2019t seem prudent to us given the circumstances. There are at least two deals we like that we would consider starting this deal \u2013 this year, pardon me. One is in the District of Columbia proper. It\u2019s in an emerging neighborhood. We really like some of the highest per foot rents in the city, an area that, though it suffered in the pandemic, not as much as a lot of other neighborhoods. So really like the location. And because of TOPA, and I know you\u2019ve been around a lot, so you know what TOPA is, but the quick brief there as it\u2019s a law that gives residents the right to purchase their building if it\u2019s being sold in the District of Columbia. And it makes it quite difficult to sell or to acquire properties that are newly built and have a resident base, so, building like we have done before, near Union station in that NoMa area, you should expect us to do that occasionally. And to fund this by selling some of the older product we own on Wisconsin Avenue and Connecticut Avenue. So I would expect that, that deal would likely start this year. Another one is in suburban California in a location with some really powerful employer drivers nearby that we really like. The very unique thing about the deal and \u2013 is that\u2019s a density play. It\u2019s us knocking down 60 units of an existing property and putting 220 or 230 units back. So it\u2019s very efficient from a capital and return point of view. Again, it\u2019s a place we really like. It\u2019s a hard, hard place to build. So we like that. The team is very busy. We\u2019re looking at a whole bunch of stuff. As I implied in my remarks, there is a couple of things in Denver, we\u2019re thinking about as development opportunities, again. We\u2019d like to get a bigger presence there. The deals we\u2019re looking at are either path of growth, I\u2019d say, between urban and suburban or suburban development. So I\u2019d expect us to start those two deals I just mentioned, maybe one or two other things, we\u2019ll see. We think development is part of the mix here at the company, and we\u2019ll continue to do them as they sort of pencil out.\nHaendel St. Juste: Any preliminary color on potentially what yield of spread versus cap rates of IRRs could look like?\nMark Parrell: Yes, that\u2019s a terrific question because of how hard that is. You\u2019ve hit on the nub of the hardest underwriting part is what are \u2013 first of all, what are spot rents? When spot rents are going down in a lot of these places. So what does spot rent mean? And then you come back and unfortunately, 3 months later, spot rent has changed. And how do you think about rent growth? So you\u2019re going to be building these buildings for 3 years. I mean they\u2019re going to deliver in 2022 \u2013 excuse me, 2023, early 2024. You may be delivering into \u2013 you will be delivering into certainly, a very different climate and maybe a much more advantageous one. So we spend a lot of time thinking about just that. So I can\u2019t really give you a yield if we start the deals, I will talk about that. But it is \u2013 just as important as your starting rate is your rent growth assumption, when do you get back to where you were? Do you get back to where you were? How does that work? And that\u2019s the art of this process.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it, got it. Thanks for the color.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to our next question from Brent Dilts of UBS.\nBrent Dilts: Hey, guys. Thanks. You\u2019ve answered most of my questions, but just one last one here for me is how is demand trending by unit size? And how is that differing by urban or suburban or even MSA, if you have that data?\nMark Parrell: Yes. So I don\u2019t have the actual demand in totality. I will tell you that studios continue to be our most challenged unit type. So I think our overall occupancy in studios is like 93% compared to \u2013 they used to be the highest, just over 96%. And if you drill into those studios and you look at like New York and San Francisco, the occupancies of studios are down at like 85%, 86%. So I think you could say that the demand that\u2019s coming into us is still seeking kind of that one-bedroom, the larger units, even the 2-bedrooms because that is where that occupancy improvement has come from. And I think right now, we\u2019re just kind of in the wait-and-see mode to understand at what price can we clear these studios out. And when does that demand really start to return to these markets.\nBrent Dilts: Okay, thanks. Appreciate it. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. So two questions. First, as you guys look over your expirations in the next few months, to call it, March into June, do you have a sense for how many of those residents are planning to move out? Or are people not sort of indicating yet their intentions of whether or not they plan to renew or move out? And I am really focused on obviously, the major hard hit markets like New York, San Francisco, Austin.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Alex, this is Michael. So right now, we\u2019ve just started issuing April renewal offers out there. So it\u2019s hard to get kind of that indicator from residents. I will tell you, in the prepared remarks, you could see, I think we\u2019re going to be moving from the 52% that we were in January, up to 54%, maybe even 55%, as you work your way through February and March. At this time, I don\u2019t expect like the April and Mays to do anything materially different. I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re going to get back into the 60% retention rate, but you got to remember, at the onset of the pandemic, we had a lot of residents choose to renew with us that drove that kind of number up. So I think we should expect this kind of gradual improvement in retention. And I think the improvement that you\u2019re seeing is really systemic across all the markets. But again, I have the most improvement to gain or the most area to make up in San Francisco and New York. And I think at this point, it\u2019s too early to understand May, June and July kind of timeframes.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, Mark, on the portfolio, it\u2019s great to hear that you guys are considering some new markets in addition to expanding in Denver. As you guys look back over the history of the company, though, EQR has more from the El Paso or the sort of Midwest low-rise to sort of urban culminating with Archstone and now you\u2019re sort of going back. But in that process, there was dilution and that investors took as far as earnings. As you envision the next markets that you\u2019re going to enter and the transitioning to decrease your exposure in some of the majors like New York or San Francisco, do you envision like that same sort of dilution or the way you guys see it, you can see it sort of in a modest pace that earnings can still grow and so that we don\u2019t go through that same dilution that we experienced previously?\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Alex. It\u2019s Mark. So I would have told you before the pandemic that, that effort would have been accretive slightly, that we\u2019d be selling New York at 4% or slightly sub-4% cap rate and we\u2019d be buying Denver and a 4.75%, and it will all be happy and easy. Now I think those two cap rates are close to each other. Part of that is a product of what\u2019s going on in New York and San Francisco. But I don\u2019t envision this to be a dilutive exercise. I think it isn\u2019t going to be an accretive one. I think it\u2019s going to be about even now. And I think what we\u2019re buying in some of these new markets is probably better political risk, a little bit better cash flow in these assets over the long haul. And maintaining exposure, though, to these big urban centers where you have a lot of affluent renters and for New York, a really good supply picture. That\u2019s good. And I think what we\u2019ll have then is just more opportunities to invest and develop across a larger number of markets and the steadier platform win inevitable issues come up in the future. So I don\u2019t expect dilution from the process. Again, I would have told you in early \u201819, I was hoping there\u2019d be accretion in the process, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic right now.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. But it is market as a positive. I mean, you guys certainly are good on the deal side and obviously there is markets with more growth. So it\u2019s good to see you guys pursuing this. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to our next question from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Just a couple of questions. I guess, first, in terms of the improvement that you\u2019ve seen in January in terms of occupancy and also pricing. I guess, I\u2019m just wondering what we should really be reading into that? Because I think, typically, you do, like most of multifamily, gain some occupancy to start the year versus the fourth quarter. And yet both periods are very slow leasing period. So I\u2019m just kind of wondering what we should really be taking out of this about your confidence level of getting some improvement in these two quarters, which are, again, not really where you make your year, which is second quarter, third quarter in terms of occupancy and rent? What is really giving you guys confidence about your ability to do better in the spring? Is it actually something you\u2019re seeing in the data right now? Or is it more of your view about just people returning to cities and that could create leasing demand?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks Nick. It\u2019s Mark. I\u2019m going to start, and I think Michael is going to supplement. But the fact that we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we agree with you, there is a seasonal improvement in occupancy that starts to incur now, and there\u2019s certainly an improvement in rate that starts to occur now. The fact that our numbers are obeying the normal seasonal norms of our business is a very positive thing because they didn\u2019t in 2020. Occupancy rate, all those things declined when they usually went up. So the fact that our markets, and I remind everyone on the call, I mean, December and January and November, especially the end of November were horrible for the pandemic, particularly in California, which is almost half our NOI, and it got tough again in New York. So we would say, Nick, under difficult circumstances, our properties, our portfolio started to perform like it normally does. And if it performs like it normally does, that means rate and occupancy are going to keep going up every week through the end of the third quarter, and that to us is very encouraging. I\u2019d also add it\u2019s the setup. At 95% occupied, Michael and his pricing team and our colleagues in the field feel much more comfortable reducing concessions and starting to push rate when they\u2019re this well occupied. When you\u2019re on your back heels, it\u2019s harder to do. So I would say we\u2019re positioned well going in the leasing season. And just being normal is an advantage from what went on in the third and fourth quarter. I don\u2019t know, Michael, if you have something you\u2019d add?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I think I would just give a little bit of context. So normally, you\u2019re right, we run about 20% of the volume in Q1, 30% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and then it falls back to about 20% in Q4. The actual, the velocity and the strength of the leasing season that we had in Q3 and Q4 of 2020 has actually shifted this profile a little bit, and put us now for 35% of our leases expiring in the third quarter of 21% and 22% in the fourth quarter. So I actually view this as a little bit of a positive that we shifted some of these expirations to be back-half loaded, which gives us more time to even recover some of this rate and then get through those leases.\nNick Yulico: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate that. I guess just one last question is, could you give a sense for where you think in-place rents are for your portfolio versus the market? Just trying to kind of gauge the level of above-market leases you still have to deal with in the portfolio that could be expiring in coming quarters?\nMark Parrell: Yes. So I think you are referring to gain in loss to lease. So basically, just snapshotting kind of our rents in place and comparing it to the existing rent rule. Sitting here, and I did this basically at the end of January. Our gain-to-lease was 6.5%, not including concessions, 9.5% when you fold it in concessions, and that is clearly front-loaded. So the numbers are \u2013 we have much higher gains in that Q1, and then it starts to kind of gradually down. We actually flip to kind of the loss to lease model back in that fourth quarter. But I think at this point, you\u2019re looking at this at the lowest point in the rent seasonality, rents are the lowest, and you\u2019re comparing this still against people that were pre-pandemic and then new people. So I don\u2019t really \u2013 I mean, I think it\u2019s a good snapshot to understand what could be. But I think really over the next couple of months, this number is going to move around a little bit.\nMichael Manelis: And the other thing, the number is useful for, Nick, is you\u2019ve got checking and the investors now got checking our guidance. So when people try and understand that, to understand where they gain the leases, gives you some idea of where our starting point is and what we need to make up during the course of the year.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thank you, Mark and Michael. Appreciate it.\nMark Parrell: Thanks Nick.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go at Alex Kalmus of Zelman & Associates.\nAlex Kalmus: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the projects in the pipeline and expected lease-ups over the next year, it seems like there\u2019s a lot more projects in the urban markets. Granted there\u2019s some supply chain and construction delays in typical in those markets. But what are your expectations for the coming year in the urban core?\nMark Parrell: So I just want to make sure I understand your question, Alex. So you ask us what we see for supply in, call it, New York, Central New York and San Francisco kind of in \u201821?\nAlex Kalmus: Correct. Thank you.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So I\u2019ll just start at the top and just say, so right now, when you think about the natural shifts that happened between the fourth quarter into the first quarter. When we look at supply for \u201820 and \u201821, we think the overall numbers is going to be relatively the same. I think you picked up in my prepared remarks, San Francisco is elevated, and a lot of that is the concentration sitting in South Bay. When you look at markets like New York, it\u2019s really nonexistent in Manhattan from a competitive landscape against us. And we have a little bit in the Hudson Waterfront. So, when we think about supply, we are looking at these numbers in totality, but we really go granular. We go down to an individual asset, and we\u2019re looking at what new deliveries are coming at us or what existing deliveries are still kind of working their way through their lease-up process. And what pressure do we think that, that\u2019s going to have on us in terms of performance as we work our way through the year. So it\u2019s a very granular process. And I think when we roll it all up, right now, you\u2019ve got \u2013 you still have a lot of supply coming at you in D.C., so another 12,000 units being delivered. The question there is really just the ability for the market to absorb that supply. From a competitive standpoint, I really stand back and just say the South Bay and San Francisco and a little bit in the Peninsula is going to have a little bit more pressure on us than we have felt in the past.\nMark Parrell: And Alex, it\u2019s Mark. If I can just add something on some sort of new research we\u2019ve done to try and think about just new starts, so not completions, as Michael was referring, but starts as we look at \u2013 just \u2013 it\u2019s tough to make these deals pencil in the urban centers. So we\u2019re trying to determine what does it look like in \u201823. And a couple of our guys, it\u2019s really good work, and the work was focused on, what do we see starting within, call it, 2 miles of our properties, remembering that all supply in a market is competitive with us. But Michael would tell you and our operators would tell you that the supply that\u2019s very close is what is most damaging to our rent roll. So looking at what\u2019s relatively close to us, looking at what starts were from 2016 to 2019 by market, getting an average and comparing that to what we saw in \u201820 and \u201821. What we see that\u2019s being generated in \u201821, will lead us to believe that starts are likely to be down 30%, and thus deliveries are down 30% in, say, 2023, especially in our urban markets. Now in Washington, DC that number seems completely unaffected. I mean starts seem relatively constant. But we are seeing that, and we hope that, that\u2019s an additional tailwind. But again, this is relatively new research that our folks have done that we think is informing us to our optimism about supply close in urban center coming forward.\nAlex Kalmus: Really appreciate the color. Thank you. And\u2026\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nAlex Kalmus: Moving to the bad debt assumptions in the revenue guidance you gave. Is a lot of that predicated on California\u2019s decision to extend AB-3088 into June? And is that the most sensitive aspect to that bad debt assumption or are there other regulatory or macroeconomic factors that would cause up or down based on that?\nMark Parrell: I think our somewhat increased pessimism about bad debt over the last 2 months was based on both the new administration, doing its extension under its CDC Authority, California doing an extension, New York, all these markets sort of chiming in, given that the pandemic got challenging again in the fourth quarter and in January that all this got extended, which meant that we wouldn\u2019t get resolution. But I will say that we didn\u2019t \u2013 and this is why our guidance, as Bob acknowledged, was a little conservative remains in our minds, maybe a little conservative on bad debt, is that we didn\u2019t take into account either the $25 billion that was passed in the old administration\u2019s bill in December for rental relief. New York put rules out last \u2013 yesterday on that. California put those out a week ago. We\u2019re still analyzing all of that. So we\u2019re not sure. We certainly intend to get involved there and make sure our residents, who are in a delinquency situation, are aware of that and can take advantage of it. So we may get some benefit there from taking advantage of some of those programs. The Biden administration $1.9 trillion program has another $25 billion in it for rent for helping folks that are behind in their rents, so rental assistance. Again, who knows if that passes, but that\u2019s very helpful. Along with in the $1.9 trillion bill is $350 million of aid to cities. And that is tremendously helpful to places like New York, we\u2019re thinking about tax increases or service cuts. And so I\u2019ve taken your question a little longer, but I think it\u2019s important that some of these government restrictions are problematic, but they come with some good things as well, especially for owners like us of apartments that are in more urban settings.\nAlex Kalmus: Appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: And with no further questions in the queue, Mr. McKenna, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark Parrell: Yes. It\u2019s Mark Parrell. Well, thank you all for your interest in Equity Residential and have a good day. Take care.\nOperator: That does conclude the call. I would like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. So, 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business, so let me start by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through 2020 by serving our customers, taking care of each other and driving the best results possible given the circumstances. Despite the challenges, we are excited that 2020 is behind us and optimistic that 2021 will be a year of recovery. As Mark mentioned, we have begun to see improvements in both physical occupancy and pricing. Notably, this is the first time this has occurred since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to test price sensitivity in many markets by reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted and beginning to raise rates.  In November, concessions averaged just over 6 weeks free on about 45% of our applications. In recent weeks, concessions have averaged just under 6 weeks on only about one-third of our applications. All that said, it will take some time to fully recover from the unprecedented events that have occurred, particularly in our hardest hit markets. While we are optimistic about the recovery, it is hard to handicap its pace, especially in New York and San Francisco, our hardest hit cities. On Page 3 of the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics broken out by our urban core, urban other and suburban portfolios. I will not walk through all the specific metrics in the presentation, but I do want to highlight some of the performance indicators we remain focused on. So first, demand, demand continues to be robust and has carried us through much of the winter season with increased move-in activity well above seasonal norms. Application counts exceeded 2019 levels by 25% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to generate sufficient front door activity to have move-ins outpace move-outs despite higher turnover compared to the 2019 record low level. We haven't seen this net gain in move-ins since the onset of the pandemic. Applications have remained robust in January, albeit below December's levels, but that isn't surprising since improved occupancy has allowed us to start testing pricing, and we have fewer units available to sell. Turning to pricing, the chart on pricing trend, which includes the impact on concessions, is a good indicator of where rents are headed, and it has been improving across both the urban and suburban markets for the last 8 weeks or so. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved, will continue to be negative for some time as this metric compares new leases written or renewed with those that were before the pandemic began. That said, the rate of change of blended rates has flattened. And for the first time, we have seen modest sequential improvement in new lease rates, which is helpful. We continue to experience negotiation pressure on renewal rates and we are still renewing residents who signed leases pre-pandemic. We have found some stability in the percent of residents renewing, which stands at approximately 52% in January. We expect that to improve to around 54% for February and March, which is still below our usual retention rates for this time of year. Before moving to market commentary, I want to summarize that while the operating environment remains challenging, we continue to see good demand for our product, and we are starting to see early signs of pricing improvement. We have a long way to go, but recovery is in sight. Now, let me provide some brief market commentary. Starting with Boston, strong application volume and improved retention through the fourth quarter resulted in steady gains in occupancy to position us to 95.5% today. This market has been dialing back concession use and raising rates consecutively for the past 4 weeks. At present, concessions are being used on about 25% to 30% of our applications and averaging right at 6 weeks, which is compared to 50% used back in November. Going forward, we expect modest improvement in rates, but acknowledge that a full recovery will require additional demand drivers, like the Amazon jobs Mark mentioned in his remarks, to aid in the absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated through the year. Long-term demand drivers remain positive, with a very bullish outlook for biotech and pharma space, fueling job creation. At this point, it is hard to forecast exactly how some of the traditional demand drivers associated with Boston play out, notably students, both domestic and international, and the jobs that support that infrastructure. We expect to have a better view on these by late spring, early summer before the fall semester. Anecdotally, I will tell you that January did see a few applications from foreign addresses, which we haven't seen for several months. Boston will have its challenges in \u201821, but its performance over the last 2 months has definitely improved. In 2021, we look to regain more occupancy, which will allow us to then recapture some of the rate we lost last year. New York continues to feel the outsized impact from the pandemic, but there are early signs of recovery. We recently had our best traffic week in the last 12 months and our best leasing week since August. Leasing activity is still driven by deal seekers and intracity movers, which is running about 10 points higher than normal. We still see move-outs to the suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut, but that number is normalizing. Occupancy has improved in the market and is just above 91.5%, which is the first time we have been over 90% since September of 2020. Some additional color on recent traffic includes that we are just now starting to have former residents reaching out to our property teams, contemplating moving back to the city. Like in Boston, we are seeing the first signs of international students and specific to New York, UN workers looking to come back. And finally, we saw a few roommate type prospects emerging from their parents' basements. Many of these prospects are looking for late spring or early summer time frames in anticipation of their offices opening back up. We still see a good amount of deal hoppers and upgraders as well as prospects from the outer boroughs who can now afford to live in Manhattan, and many of them are telling our on-site teams, they think the market bottom is near, and they don't want to miss out. Concessions remain prevalent in this market with 70% of the applications receiving about 2 months free. Rates are beginning to show signs of improvement, and we are just starting to gradually dial back concessions. For 2021, our focus in New York will be recapturing as much of the occupancy rate as possible while lowering and possibly eliminating the use of concessions. While the market will still produce a negative decline for the year, New York has upside potential given the dramatic declines we saw in 2020. Recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply, the return to office and the continued growth of the big tech employers in the market. Moving to DC, which has been our most resilient market on the East Coast, occupancy remained solid at 95.5%, but the market continues to feel the impact from the delivery of Class A multifamily product, which is not being absorbed as efficiently in previous years. Federal government employment has grown, but the overall job growth has declined. Concession use was up in the quarter with the largest amount focused in the district. The good news, however, is that as fast as concessions came into the market during the fourth quarter, they have now been greatly reduced. Since mid-December, we are only using concessions on 15% of the applications, and they've been averaging just below 1 month. 2021 will be focused on balancing occupancy and rate as we face supply pressure from yet another 12,000 units being delivered into the market. Recent signs of improvement provide us more confidence in the market's ability to absorb the new units and allow for continued rate recovery, which could make DC one of our better performing markets in 2021. Heading West, Denver, albeit a small portfolio for us, is holding up well. For 2021, all 5 of our Denver communities will be included in the same-store results. Occupancy is sitting around 96%, and both new lease change and renewal rates are improving. Renewals are showing positive growth rates in December and January and concession use is trending down. In Seattle, we are seeing early indications that the bottom may be behind us. Occupancy continues to improve as traffic is up over January 2020 by about 6%, and we are seeing weekly application numbers that are closer to peak leasing season levels. Concessions remained common in the market, especially in the urban submarkets. During the fourth quarter, concessions averaged about 6 weeks free on about 55% of our applications. Strength in occupancy, both at our properties and more generally, in the overall market, are allowing for a gradual reduction in concessions. We have heard from our Seattle teams that many prospects seem less concerned about the monthly rate right now as they are about getting a deal. While current rent freeze restrictions may limit renewal performance in the first half of the year, overall fundamentals for this market support a recovery. Recent home price appreciation and the increase in this quarter's job postings from the technology companies should continue to drive strong demand for our product. The focus in Seattle in 2021 is maintaining the strong occupancy we currently have while pushing rate. San Francisco remains our most challenged market. But even here, there are some very early signs of recovery. Occupancy is just below 94% and has improved 150 basis points since the beginning of November. The downtown portfolio remains pressured on rate with concessions that averaged 6 weeks in the quarter on about two-thirds of our applications. January concessions improved to a 1-month average on less than half the applications. Anecdotally, stories from our teams across the bay are reporting that people who left to go to other areas like Denver and Sacramento, are now looking to move back to be near their office or in desirable school districts. The extent of the Bay Area recovery will improve as we get even more clarity on tech company's plans regarding return to office. We acknowledge that work from home will play a role, but we believe that in-person collaboration and much lower rent levels should make San Francisco attractive again. There have been headlines about corporate relocations out of state and clearly that is not a positive for the market, but it is important to keep reading. The Bay Area continues to attract venture capital and is yet to be replaced as the epicenter of the tech economy. Bay Area tech companies are also feeling a bit more optimistic and their ability to receive H1B visas under the new administration, which could increase demand in this market. Supply in \u201821 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and in the South Bay. Feedback from our local team was that the recent lifting of the stay in home order can definitely be felt in the downtown market with much more active streets and outdoor restaurant seating filled to the new lower allowed capacity levels. These are the first signs of bringing life back to the city. Our focus in San Francisco in \u201821 is to build back our occupancy, particularly in the downtown submarket, get rid of concessions and then push rate. While San Francisco will produce a revenue decline in \u201821, it, like New York, has a lot of upside potential due to the steep decline in 2020. Finally, moving to Southern California, which continues to hold up much better than the Bay Area, despite some pretty difficult pandemic-related headlines in the LA area our Los Angeles portfolio maintained occupancy above 95% through the quarter. Concession use was modest and averaged just under 1 month on about 20% of our applications. Operationally, the story is similar to the third quarter with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown Korea Mid Wilshire corridor. West LA continues to feel the pressure from the slow restart of online content creation, but new lease and renewal rates have shown some stability through the fourth quarter and into January. The suburban portfolio has very strong occupancy at or near 97%, and the submarkets of Inland Empire, Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County continued to experience modest year-over-year gains in rental income. For \u201821, L.A. should be one of our better markets. We have recaptured our occupancy. Concession use has already been dialed back and now, our opportunity is on increasing rate and managing delinquency. I will finish with Orange County in San Diego, which are primarily suburban markets for us and have averaged around 97% occupancy through the quarter. These markets continue to demonstrate resilience and produced higher resident retention than in any of our other markets. Both of these markets are presenting opportunities to increase rates and are expected to continue to perform well through 2021. In closing, we remain optimistic that the early signs of recovery that we now see will continue and that through \u201821, we will build occupancy on the back of strong demand, leading to improved pricing power. Our efforts over the next several months will be focused on seeking out opportunities to maximize the trade-off between rate and occupancy, while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana. Yes. Hey, John, this is Michael. So I think the way to think about renewals is, first and foremost, we have a pretty difficult comp period in front of us with Q1 and Q2. And then as you turn that corner, you would expect performance and renewals to start turning positive. Yes. So Nick, this is Michael. So really, we are not seeing any kind of material shifts when we look at those applications. So we've looked at kind of rent as a percent of income. The portfolio has always averaged somewhere right around 19% for those move-ins in the fourth quarter, we were also right at 19%. What we did see a little bit happen is the range that we used to see as rent as a percent of income, used to be from 17% to 23%, with Seattle being the low at 17% and San Diego being the high at 23%. That range has expanded a little bit to 16% and 24%, but it's really a marginal shift in this stuff. So, from the demographic side no change in the average age of applicants coming in. The income, I guess, I would tell you, when you look at New York, you have got some affordability opportunities right now. So you're seeing average incomes coming down for applications in New York, but it's still well over $220,000 a year, and the ratio is still at like 18.5%. So actually, everything we have looked at right now would suggest that all of our new applicants and all of our new residents coming in, from an affordability, from a demographic standpoint, really kind of demonstrate their ability to pay as the markets start to reaccelerate and stay with us. So Rich, this is Michael. I will just start off and say, just overall, when we have looked at the percent of residents moving to buy homes, again, this is one of those sets we really have not seen a difference. At a portfolio level, we're running just over 12.5% of residents moving out. When you go specific to New York, we really haven't seen any material change on that front at all. It's actually declined a little bit in the fourth quarter. So I think relative to our assumptions as we move forward, I think you heard in my prepared remarks, we're starting to see some improvement in the percent of residents renewing. So for the portfolio, we are expecting to be up at 54%. New York is still one of those markets that we are off \u2013 we are off what is normal for that market. So we're still sitting below 50%, and we should be up above 60%. And so I think our modeling and our assumptions going forward is that we start to see a little bit of improvement in our ability to retain those residents, but nothing specific to them, more of them moving out to go buy homes. So I think, first of all, those \u2013 like that's just the anecdotal statements that's coming to us. So the quantity is small, right? But every week, we're on the phone with our on-site teams, and we're just trying to get some color around the applications and where they were coming from. When we see the inflows, which is new applicants for San Francisco, 87% of all of our applications are coming to us from within the state of California, and 70% are coming from within that MSA. Both of these numbers are up about 10 points each. So you're still seeing that elevated kind of activity, which to us, is still that deal seeker, right? They're coming in, they're taking advantage of that price. So from the out migration in, those states, where people have left and are coming back, it's just starting to trickle in. It hasn't really manifested itself into a large enough percentage change. But I think the positive is, is that we haven't heard any of that for months. And now we're just now starting to hear that. This is base rent, but it includes \u2013 it's a net effective. So it includes the impact of the concession. So basically, if you scraped our website and you looked at every single one of our units, what we'd be charging, it's the rent, the amenity, rent \u2013 amenitized rent and the impact of that concession. Yes. Alex, this is Michael. So right now, we've just started issuing April renewal offers out there. So it's hard to get kind of that indicator from residents. I will tell you, in the prepared remarks, you could see, I think we're going to be moving from the 52% that we were in January, up to 54%, maybe even 55%, as you work your way through February and March. At this time, I don't expect like the April and Mays to do anything materially different. I'm optimistic that we're going to get back into the 60% retention rate, but you got to remember, at the onset of the pandemic, we had a lot of residents choose to renew with us that drove that kind of number up. So I think we should expect this kind of gradual improvement in retention. And I think the improvement that you're seeing is really systemic across all the markets. But again, I have the most improvement to gain or the most area to make up in San Francisco and New York. And I think at this point, it's too early to understand May, June and July kind of timeframes. Yes. I think I would just give a little bit of context. So normally, you're right, we run about 20% of the volume in Q1, 30% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and then it falls back to about 20% in Q4. The actual, the velocity and the strength of the leasing season that we had in Q3 and Q4 of 2020 has actually shifted this profile a little bit, and put us now for 35% of our leases expiring in the third quarter of 21% and 22% in the fourth quarter. So I actually view this as a little bit of a positive that we shifted some of these expirations to be back-half loaded, which gives us more time to even recover some of this rate and then get through those leases. And the other thing, the number is useful for, Nick, is you've got checking and the investors now got checking our guidance. So when people try and understand that, to understand where they gain the leases, gives you some idea of where our starting point is and what we need to make up during the course of the year. Yes. So I'll just start at the top and just say, so right now, when you think about the natural shifts that happened between the fourth quarter into the first quarter. When we look at supply for \u201820 and \u201821, we think the overall numbers is going to be relatively the same. I think you picked up in my prepared remarks, San Francisco is elevated, and a lot of that is the concentration sitting in South Bay. When you look at markets like New York, it's really nonexistent in Manhattan from a competitive landscape against us. And we have a little bit in the Hudson Waterfront. So, when we think about supply, we are looking at these numbers in totality, but we really go granular. We go down to an individual asset, and we're looking at what new deliveries are coming at us or what existing deliveries are still kind of working their way through their lease-up process. And what pressure do we think that, that's going to have on us in terms of performance as we work our way through the year. So it's a very granular process. And I think when we roll it all up, right now, you've got \u2013 you still have a lot of supply coming at you in D.C., so another 12,000 units being delivered. The question there is really just the ability for the market to absorb that supply. From a competitive standpoint, I really stand back and just say the South Bay and San Francisco and a little bit in the Peninsula is going to have a little bit more pressure on us than we have felt in the past."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I want to start by thanking all 2,700 of my Equity Residential colleagues across the country for their dedication in serving our 150,000 residents during a very difficult year. Your commitment and hard work at the company through 2020 and I know you are ready to drive our recovery in 2021. Today, I will start with some color on the current state of our business and its future prospects, then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide an operating update, and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide detail on our guidance expectations, and then we will take your questions. We also posted to our website at equityapartments.com a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations. Turning to the business, we are encouraged by the recovery in demand in all of our markets and especially, in our urban submarkets. In real estate, demand is the unsolvable problem. Without it no other economic factor matters and in our business, both urban and suburban, we see plenty of it. As noted in the presentation and release applications, net move in activity and occupancy have all turned upward, especially over the last 2 months. This positive trend, in spite of a worsening pandemic, and renewed shutdowns in our markets gives us even more of a cause for optimism. If demand is this strong now, we think that when the vaccines are more fully distributed and cities reopened, our business will really hum. The fact that this is likely to coincide with our traditional leasing season with its higher seasonal demand positions us especially well. Admittedly, though pricing remains weak, but there are signs of the beginnings of improvement. As we noted in the presentation, pricing trends have turned up over the past few months, led by our urban core markets of New York City, the city of San Francisco and the cities of Boston and Cambridge. We also see declining forward concessions. With occupancy firming and strong demand going into our busiest time of the year, we believe that we can recover considerable ground on the pricing side as 2021 plays out. While we see signs of recovery, our current results reflect the still challenging climate in many of our markets. You may remember that on prior calls, I made clear that the impact of lower rents and higher concessions in 2020 and currently, will take some time to fully manifest itself in our reported numbers. That impact arrived in the form of our fourth quarter 2020 same-store revenue results as we continue entering into new leases and renewing existing leases at lower rents, reflecting the post pandemic leasing climate as well as amortizing concessions from leases written in 2020. But just as our reported results lagged, our actual operating environment on the way down, they will also lag it on the way up. So, you should expect relatively weak same-store revenue results in the first half of 2021, with a marked improvement in our revenue numbers in the second half of the year as we benefit from improving pricing, higher occupancy and lower concessions plus easier post pandemic comparable periods.  The interplay of our expectations of increasing occupancy, pricing that is improving, but will be lower than last year's pricing until midyear or so, and the amortization of 2020 and \u201821 concessions creates considerable modeling complexity for us and for our investors and analysts. Because of this more complex picture than usual, we thought it was particularly important that we reinstate guidance to give investors a better idea of management's view of the year. Our guidance has a wider than usual range to account for the multitude of factors, both positive and negative, that may impact our business in 2021. While I certainly acknowledge that the pandemic has created unique challenges, Equity Residential same-store revenue growth, coming out of recessions, is typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on the continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other general economic conditions remain supportive. Turning to the long term, we believe that the fundamental factors that have long made Equity Residential an attractive place to invest your capital remain just as true now as before the pandemic. First, our capital is invested in markets that will continue to be the centers of the knowledge economy that drives the growth of this country, centers of innovation in technology, finance, entertainment, medicine and life sciences.  Even in the pandemic, we have seen announcements of new high-quality jobs in our urban centers like Amazon's announcement that it's putting 3,000 new technology and software development jobs in the Seaport District of Boston. And with the recent commencement of construction on Disney's new building in Hudson Square in New York, that will lead to a significant influx of new content creation and technology jobs. And while the remote work trend may change the number of days that we are in the office, we are, by our nature, social animals. Our need to interact with each other to create, to share ideas, to manage our businesses and to start new ones is not being met by meetings on a video screen. Second, we believe that the entertainment, cultural and social attractions that fill the great urban centers in which we operate will soon reopen, and will again prove to be magnets for affluent renters. We believe that many renters desire both the work proximity I just mentioned as well as easy access to the amazing entertainment, cultural and social opportunities our cities will provide once they are reopened. Not to mention the ability to live in an exciting, dynamic and diverse community. Our residents that live in our more urban properties do so because they value the lifestyle of our country's great urban centers. Third, we have a highly skilled affluent customer base, able to afford our rent and will accept future rent increases as conditions improve. Our residents are well employed in growing industries like technology, biotech and new media. Industries that we also think are less susceptible over time, the job loss from increasing waves of automation and offshoring. In the pandemic period, overall unemployment rose to almost 15% and is now around 6%, while job losses for those with a bachelor's degree or better, which is our target demographic, peaked at 8.4% and has now gone down to 3.8%. Our resident base proved its quality again in the fourth quarter as we collected 97% of our expected residential revenues. We think the quality of our customer base is, over the long haul, one of our greatest strengths. Fourth, the superior location and quality of our portfolio makes our properties attractive places for our residents to live, and it also makes our properties attractive places for private investors to invest their capital. This makes our properties liquid and appreciating over the long term. Capital has long been drawn to the higher quality properties we own, and that will continue to be the case, even in markets like New York and San Francisco once the pandemic abates. We also believe that the lower long-term capital spending required to maintain our properties and income stream compares favorably with that of older, lower quality apartment buildings. But our portfolio can always be improved and you should expect this to be more active recyclers of capital over the next few years. As I have said on prior calls, even before the pandemic, in order to create the most stable and growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are inclined to further diversify our portfolio in the higher end suburban locations in our current markets as well as into a few select new markets with favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and a growing affluent renter base. These affluent renters are found in abundance in our existing markets, but there are also increasing concentrations of them in denser suburbs near city centers of our existing markets and in places like Denver, which is a market we reentered in 2016.  You have seen us do this over the last few years as we have acquired properties in suburban Seattle and Washington DC, with strong resident demographics. We are looking hard at several other suburban assets as well as development and acquisition opportunities in Denver that we find appealing in long term. We will fund this by lowering our concentration of assets in city centers in our existing markets, and by exiting assets elsewhere that do not meet our return parameters. To close, we have the best team in the business, ready to maximize results when the pandemic ends and a sturdy balance sheet that gives us ample flexibility. We are tremendously optimistic about our company's future because we believe that the markets in which we operate will thrive when we get to the other side of this pandemic. And with the rollout of vaccines, we are on our way. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis. John, just to add some color, it's Mark. Yes, just to add some color that will get your clarification in. That is partly because things are recovering and getting better, that's partly because the 2020 comp periods are declining, right. Rates declined and they declined particularly hard late in the second quarter and through the third. So, we look at this line as kind of crossing these two lines in the middle of the year. And I am sorry you were asking a clarification there? Yes. Thanks, John. So, in terms of values and let's focus for just a moment on the hardest hit markets of New York and San Francisco. I start by saying there has just been very little \u2013 and you know there is very little volume, much, much less. In fact, we can sort of name the deals, the Chief Investment Officer and I that have closed. The ones that have closed, and there's one in Union Square in New York that closed right about what pre-pandemic values would have been. So that's an asset that I think was about $1,200 a foot, $900,000 a unit, at like a 3.6% tax cap rate \u2013 excuse me, very much value would have traded at before the pandemic, but it's just one deal. And I don't have a lot of others. In San Francisco, there is certainly been some stuff traded, smaller deals. I would say we're probably down 10% or so on value in San Francisco and New York. We are starting to hear from people who want to acquire assets from us in those markets. The thought being, they will ride the recovery up. We get that, and we probably \u2013 our sellers, as I implied in my remarks in those markets to some extent. Remember, we still have those 421a assets in New York that have the big tax increases. We have a big concentration in the city of San Francisco. But for us to sell much below the pre-pandemic value, it doesn't make a lot of sense because we believe in the recovery in those markets. So we think revenues are going up pretty sharply, especially in the second half of this year and into \u201822. And the idea that we would sell at a big discount doesn't make sense to me, but I think you will see us start to be more active sellers in those two places. Other places like Seattle, particularly has had a spade of sales, including a pretty large one in Bellevue, at very good pricing at pre-pandemic value or maybe even better, obviously, lower cap rates because NOI is down. So Seattle has had some strong numbers. DC too, a lot of suburban stuffs traded or a fair number of suburban things have traded. So we see that as market is holding up. I haven't seen a lot of urban stuff traded. There is some rules in DC that have come in the force that make it hard in a district to sell assets right now. So I will pause there and I hope that's responsive. Thank you. Well, we all are able to boil it down to the math, but there is a lot more to it than that. I \u2013 again, we have seen deals we have underwritten, for example in Denver lately that are 7 un-levered IRR deals, maybe even some high 6s. A lot of stuff we are selling might be 1% lower than that. But of course, the assumptions matter a lot and how do you think about your recovery in rents, which is so hard to peg as you know. So, we do think that what matters in moving our capital around is ending up in the place that risk-adjusted is best. And in some cases, some of the markets also have more political risk, other markets have more supply risk, and we just got to balance that out. So there we do see, obviously, a higher IRR in the stuff we are buying than the stuff we are selling. But a lot of stuff we are selling is interesting to the buyers because they are levering it up or they have got a renovation play or some other way they are juicing their IRR that we either don't believe in or can't underwrite. So, I guess that's how I would answer. It's kind of not as mathematical as just maybe it's 1% better. And Rich, it's Mark. Just to support Michael's comment. There isn't anything expressly in our guidance about increasing home purchases. Home portfolio was kind of designed not to have a lot of concerns about people moving out to buy homes. And as far as we can tell, that continues to be the case historically. Going forward, a lot of the renewals that Michael is thinking about now and a lot of these people that could elect to buy a home, these were people that renewed with us or least initially with us in the pandemic, I mean we are rolling into a period where everyone would have leased with us knowing what the situation was in New York and especially in March, April and May when it was particularly dire. So I would have thought that if they really were thinking home buying was absolutely at the top of their list, or disproportionately our population of renters thought that they already would have been in the suburbs. They already would have rented there in the hopes of buying. So I'm guessing the homebuilding, home buying boom in the Tri-State area is not actually going to matter very much to us. Thank you, Rich. Yes. So, I think it's a great question. And I think as we think about the forwarding address for residents that are leaving us, we still see a little bit of an elevated number in those that are leaving urban submarkets to go to suburban submarkets. When we think about our own suburban portfolio, I think a lot of what you're seeing right now, in the management presentation, a lot of that is just normal seasonality as to how the markets actually would react. And I think what we're seeing is we had strong demand, we maintained good occupancy throughout the year, and I think we're going to continue to do that with stability and start pushing rate and try to recover as much of the rate as we can in the suburban submarkets. Yes. So in the fourth quarter, the lease breaks is still elevated kind of on a year-over-year basis. But we are starting to see kind of that percent and the numbers start coming back into norms. I think we peaked up in September at like 36%, and the fourth quarter is now kind of gradually coming back down. We'd expect this number. I think we're at like 25%, we'd expect this to be coming at somewhere around 20%. Yes, so about 10% of our residents have children living with them. We haven't seen a change in that trend. And part of that is, I mean, our portfolio hasn't changed. It still has a limited number of 3-bedroom units. It's \u2013 there's a fair number of one-bedrooms and studios. So I wouldn't expect that, Amanda, to change very much just because again, our portfolio is more suited to couples and a few roommate situations and some families, certainly, but it's just \u2013 it is like we added 3-bedroom units to the portfolio to make it more family-friendly in the last couple of quarters. Thank you. Great. Thanks for those questions, John. So, there is a surface inconsistency there. I mean what our overall strategic goal is, as I said, is to just have a growing and steadily growing dividend and cash flow of the business. And to do that, the management team, even before the pandemic and the Board, had decided that we were going to spread our capital again, into these dense suburban areas around our urban centers, while still maintaining a significant urban center presence and into a few new markets or renewed markets in the case of Denver. So that was the plan. We do think there's going to be a pretty good recovery in these urban centers, and we think 1 of 2 things is going to happen. We're either going to be able to sell those assets now with the buyer understanding that they're going to need to pay close to \u2013 close or at pre-pandemic value because they're almost certain, in our opinion, at least to obtain a pretty good increase in revenue over the next couple of years, or we are going to wait and our shareholders who have suffered with the downside of the reduction in the urban centers will get that benefit.  And then we'll sell a few of those assets later. So, it's not that we don't believe in the urban centers, we'll stay over-weighted to them, but not this over-weighted. And in terms of exact numbers, we have 9 significant buildings in the city of San Francisco. That's probably more than we need to have, but exactly how many should leave or go, I'm not sure. On the other hand, we did buy assets in the Bay Area. And we're thinking about developing a couple of deals. They're just more Peninsula or East Bay or just sort of spreading the capital out. You saw our development deal, John, that's sitting on the island just outside of Oakland. So you should just sort of expect a decline in the city of San Francisco and overall, California, just again, because of the concentrated political risk there. I don't have an order of magnitude to give you, but that's a source.  And New York composed predominantly at Brooklyn and Manhattan. Again, we have significant number, approaching 30 buildings in that area and to get rid of a few of those buildings at the right price. We are looking at a development deal in the tri-state area, we've acquired in Jersey City over the last year or two. So, it's not like we are not interested in staying invested in the area. It's just spreading the money out a little bit. So, I guess I'd have you stay tuned for the exact numbers, but you should expect a lessening in California, specifically the city of San Francisco and a lessening in New York provided pricing makes sense and an increase in a place like Denver and in some of these suburban places as well as maybe another couple of markets. No. I think they're spreading out more. I think new places are urbanizing. I think New York will continue to be a great urban center and San Francisco will eventually recover. But I think places like Denver now have an urban center. It's not as dense as it needs to be, but it's attractive, and we have 3 buildings in Downtown Denver, and those are well occupied. So I guess I'd say, I think the trend towards urbanization, I think, is inexorable over the whole world and in the United States. I think it gets thrown off kilter for temporary periods of time like the pandemic. I think what's going on in the United States is other places. And again, Denver is an example, Austin, Texas, start to become more dense and become more attractive for a variety of reasons. So there's just going to be more cities. I mean Seattle joined the party 15 years ago in regards to having a really significant downtown. So I just think some of these other cities are also densifying, but I don't believe that urbanization is going to end in the United States. I think it's just merely been interrupted. Thanks, John. Good morning. Yes. Thanks, Haendel. I appreciate that question. So, I think all three of our development deals that you now see in the supplementary disclosure are going to deliver this year. We'll certainly be in lease-up for some time. We've been looking at a couple of deals. We started nothing in 2020. That just didn't seem prudent to us given the circumstances. There are at least two deals we like that we would consider starting this deal \u2013 this year, pardon me. One is in the District of Columbia proper. It's in an emerging neighborhood. We really like some of the highest per foot rents in the city, an area that, though it suffered in the pandemic, not as much as a lot of other neighborhoods. So really like the location. And because of TOPA, and I know you've been around a lot, so you know what TOPA is, but the quick brief there as it's a law that gives residents the right to purchase their building if it's being sold in the District of Columbia. And it makes it quite difficult to sell or to acquire properties that are newly built and have a resident base, so, building like we have done before, near Union station in that NoMa area, you should expect us to do that occasionally. And to fund this by selling some of the older product we own on Wisconsin Avenue and Connecticut Avenue. So I would expect that, that deal would likely start this year. Another one is in suburban California in a location with some really powerful employer drivers nearby that we really like. The very unique thing about the deal and \u2013 is that's a density play. It's us knocking down 60 units of an existing property and putting 220 or 230 units back. So it's very efficient from a capital and return point of view. Again, it's a place we really like. It's a hard, hard place to build. So we like that. The team is very busy. We're looking at a whole bunch of stuff. As I implied in my remarks, there is a couple of things in Denver, we're thinking about as development opportunities, again. We'd like to get a bigger presence there. The deals we're looking at are either path of growth, I'd say, between urban and suburban or suburban development. So I'd expect us to start those two deals I just mentioned, maybe one or two other things, we'll see. We think development is part of the mix here at the company, and we'll continue to do them as they sort of pencil out. Yes, that's a terrific question because of how hard that is. You've hit on the nub of the hardest underwriting part is what are \u2013 first of all, what are spot rents? When spot rents are going down in a lot of these places. So what does spot rent mean? And then you come back and unfortunately, 3 months later, spot rent has changed. And how do you think about rent growth? So you're going to be building these buildings for 3 years. I mean they're going to deliver in 2022 \u2013 excuse me, 2023, early 2024. You may be delivering into \u2013 you will be delivering into certainly, a very different climate and maybe a much more advantageous one. So we spend a lot of time thinking about just that. So I can't really give you a yield if we start the deals, I will talk about that. But it is \u2013 just as important as your starting rate is your rent growth assumption, when do you get back to where you were? Do you get back to where you were? How does that work? And that's the art of this process. Thank you. Yes. So I don't have the actual demand in totality. I will tell you that studios continue to be our most challenged unit type. So I think our overall occupancy in studios is like 93% compared to \u2013 they used to be the highest, just over 96%. And if you drill into those studios and you look at like New York and San Francisco, the occupancies of studios are down at like 85%, 86%. So I think you could say that the demand that's coming into us is still seeking kind of that one-bedroom, the larger units, even the 2-bedrooms because that is where that occupancy improvement has come from. And I think right now, we're just kind of in the wait-and-see mode to understand at what price can we clear these studios out. And when does that demand really start to return to these markets. Thanks, Alex. It's Mark. So I would have told you before the pandemic that, that effort would have been accretive slightly, that we'd be selling New York at 4% or slightly sub-4% cap rate and we'd be buying Denver and a 4.75%, and it will all be happy and easy. Now I think those two cap rates are close to each other. Part of that is a product of what's going on in New York and San Francisco. But I don't envision this to be a dilutive exercise. I think it isn't going to be an accretive one. I think it's going to be about even now. And I think what we're buying in some of these new markets is probably better political risk, a little bit better cash flow in these assets over the long haul. And maintaining exposure, though, to these big urban centers where you have a lot of affluent renters and for New York, a really good supply picture. That's good. And I think what we'll have then is just more opportunities to invest and develop across a larger number of markets and the steadier platform win inevitable issues come up in the future. So I don't expect dilution from the process. Again, I would have told you in early \u201819, I was hoping there'd be accretion in the process, but I don't think that's realistic right now. Thank you. Yes. Thanks Nick. It's Mark. I'm going to start, and I think Michael is going to supplement. But the fact that we're seeing \u2013 we agree with you, there is a seasonal improvement in occupancy that starts to incur now, and there's certainly an improvement in rate that starts to occur now. The fact that our numbers are obeying the normal seasonal norms of our business is a very positive thing because they didn't in 2020. Occupancy rate, all those things declined when they usually went up. So the fact that our markets, and I remind everyone on the call, I mean, December and January and November, especially the end of November were horrible for the pandemic, particularly in California, which is almost half our NOI, and it got tough again in New York. So we would say, Nick, under difficult circumstances, our properties, our portfolio started to perform like it normally does. And if it performs like it normally does, that means rate and occupancy are going to keep going up every week through the end of the third quarter, and that to us is very encouraging. I'd also add it's the setup. At 95% occupied, Michael and his pricing team and our colleagues in the field feel much more comfortable reducing concessions and starting to push rate when they're this well occupied. When you're on your back heels, it's harder to do. So I would say we're positioned well going in the leasing season. And just being normal is an advantage from what went on in the third and fourth quarter. I don't know, Michael, if you have something you'd add? Yes. So I think you are referring to gain in loss to lease. So basically, just snapshotting kind of our rents in place and comparing it to the existing rent rule. Sitting here, and I did this basically at the end of January. Our gain-to-lease was 6.5%, not including concessions, 9.5% when you fold it in concessions, and that is clearly front-loaded. So the numbers are \u2013 we have much higher gains in that Q1, and then it starts to kind of gradually down. We actually flip to kind of the loss to lease model back in that fourth quarter. But I think at this point, you're looking at this at the lowest point in the rent seasonality, rents are the lowest, and you're comparing this still against people that were pre-pandemic and then new people. So I don't really \u2013 I mean, I think it's a good snapshot to understand what could be. But I think really over the next couple of months, this number is going to move around a little bit. Thanks Nick. So I just want to make sure I understand your question, Alex. So you ask us what we see for supply in, call it, New York, Central New York and San Francisco kind of in \u201821? And Alex, it's Mark. If I can just add something on some sort of new research we've done to try and think about just new starts, so not completions, as Michael was referring, but starts as we look at \u2013 just \u2013 it's tough to make these deals pencil in the urban centers. So we're trying to determine what does it look like in \u201823. And a couple of our guys, it's really good work, and the work was focused on, what do we see starting within, call it, 2 miles of our properties, remembering that all supply in a market is competitive with us. But Michael would tell you and our operators would tell you that the supply that's very close is what is most damaging to our rent roll. So looking at what's relatively close to us, looking at what starts were from 2016 to 2019 by market, getting an average and comparing that to what we saw in \u201820 and \u201821. What we see that's being generated in \u201821, will lead us to believe that starts are likely to be down 30%, and thus deliveries are down 30% in, say, 2023, especially in our urban markets. Now in Washington, DC that number seems completely unaffected. I mean starts seem relatively constant. But we are seeing that, and we hope that, that's an additional tailwind. But again, this is relatively new research that our folks have done that we think is informing us to our optimism about supply close in urban center coming forward. Thank you. I think our somewhat increased pessimism about bad debt over the last 2 months was based on both the new administration, doing its extension under its CDC Authority, California doing an extension, New York, all these markets sort of chiming in, given that the pandemic got challenging again in the fourth quarter and in January that all this got extended, which meant that we wouldn't get resolution. But I will say that we didn't \u2013 and this is why our guidance, as Bob acknowledged, was a little conservative remains in our minds, maybe a little conservative on bad debt, is that we didn't take into account either the $25 billion that was passed in the old administration's bill in December for rental relief. New York put rules out last \u2013 yesterday on that. California put those out a week ago. We're still analyzing all of that. So we're not sure. We certainly intend to get involved there and make sure our residents, who are in a delinquency situation, are aware of that and can take advantage of it. So we may get some benefit there from taking advantage of some of those programs. The Biden administration $1.9 trillion program has another $25 billion in it for rent for helping folks that are behind in their rents, so rental assistance. Again, who knows if that passes, but that's very helpful. Along with in the $1.9 trillion bill is $350 million of aid to cities. And that is tremendously helpful to places like New York, we're thinking about tax increases or service cuts. And so I've taken your question a little longer, but I think it's important that some of these government restrictions are problematic, but they come with some good things as well, especially for owners like us of apartments that are in more urban settings. Thanks, Alex. Yes. It's Mark Parrell. Well, thank you all for your interest in Equity Residential and have a good day. Take care."

            "name": "Bob Garechana",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. This morning, I will focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A. As part of the release and management presentation published last night, we introduced 2021 guidance after having withdrawn guidance in March 2020 due to significant uncertainties arising from the pandemic. In doing so, we acknowledge how far we progress toward the end of this pandemic, but also recognize that a significant amount of uncertainty remains. As a result, our same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO ranges are wider than normal. Let's start with our full year 2021 total same-store revenue guidance range, which is between negative 9% and negative 7%. Note that this guidance is on a GAAP basis since we report same-store revenues in the same manner and include the straight-lining of concessions as required. In our management presentation, we laid out a variety of scenarios under which we could achieve the top, bottom or points in between. That said, let me take a moment and highlight the main drivers that will shape revenue performance for the year, along with our thoughts on how 2021 might play out. First, physical occupancy, you heard both Mark and Michael talk about the improvements we are already seeing. We would expect this to continue and that as we get into the second quarter, occupancy should become a tailwind that begins to contribute to year-over-year improvement. Next, pricing, much like occupancy, the middle and higher ends of our guidance anticipate the pricing improvements discussed to continue both in improved leasing rates and reduced concessions. This positive trend, however, will take a little longer to manifest itself in our reported numbers. For leasing rates, it will take some time, not only to start writing new leases and renewing existing ones at levels above the prior year, but also to reset a meaningful part of the leasing book. The good news is that not only are we starting to see improving trends, these improvements may gain even more traction in time to coincide with our prime leasing season and resulting in positive year-over-year rates by midyear. The other element of pricing that is worth touching base upon is concessions. As I mentioned earlier, we recognized concessions on a straight-line basis as required by GAAP. That means as disclosed on Page 12 of the release, of the $31 million in cash residential concessions granted in 2020, we still have approximately $19 million of unamortized concessions that will reduce revenue in 2021, which is about 75 basis points of same-store revenue. Any new concessions granted in 2021 will also be straight lined. So the earlier in the year that the concession is granted, the more of it that will be recognized in the 2021 financial statements. We expect concessions granted will taper off during the first half of the year. But because of the combination that I just described, 2020 unamortized residuals and the timing of new 2021 concessions, this improvement won't fully manifest itself in 2021 reported GAAP results. And finally, some thoughts on bad debt, as Mark mentioned, our collections have remained both strong and consistent at approximately 97%. We incurred an approximately $13 million reduction in revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 due to uncollected rent. The middle range of our 2021 guidance assumes that this continues with only slight improvement very late in the year. We hope that we can do better than that. But given the regulatory environment, we remain cautious in our assumptions. In summary, our same-store revenue guidance incorporates recovery and operating fundamentals, but acknowledges both difficult comparable periods for the first half of 2020 and the reality that it will take time for improvements in the business to show up in our reported results. Specifically, same-store revenue performance will be sequentially negative from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 and likely not improve until the second half of the year. As fundamentals improve, consistent with our expectations, reported results will catch-up from this improvement and benefit both sequentially and from a year-over-year comparison basis. We expect same-store revenue results in the second half of the year to be better than the first half results and to position us very well for continued growth and recovery. Now some color on same-store expenses. Our full year guidance range for same-store expenses is 3% to 4%. The drivers of same-store expenses remain largely unchanged. The 4 largest expense categories continue to be real estate taxes, on-site payroll, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Before I provide you a bit of color on each, I'd like to remind you that 2020 will present a tough comparison period on expenses, given growth was only 2.1%. As you think about how this plays out quarterly, this comparison issue will especially be pronounced in the second quarter since many activities and corresponding expenses were halted in the first few months of the pandemic. Now, a little color on the major categories, real estate taxes are expected to grow in the mid-3% range, which is slightly lower than prior years. While municipalities continue to be stretched, we are seeing some jurisdictions provide relief on assessed values, and that, coupled with aggressive appeals activity, should help control growth. Perhaps even more pronounced this year than usual will be the timing and success of this appeals activity, which may present an outsized impact on where the number ultimately settles out. Payroll ended 2020 flat to 2019. This is the second year in a row that payroll growth has been less than 1%. And while many of our efficiency initiatives were delayed because of the pandemic, our hard-working on-site colleagues have continued to gain inefficiencies. As a result, 2020 makes for yet another difficult comparison for 2021. By continuing our efficiency initiatives and keeping our eye on the ball, we should still be able to limit payroll growth for the full year to around 2%. That leaves us with the final two categories of utilities and repairs and maintenance. Both are estimated to have more meaningful growth in the 4% to 5% range. In previous years, utilities benefited from modest or declining commodity price growth. In 2021, we are expecting higher natural gas prices which is driving our forecasted growth. For repairs and maintenance, a good amount of the growth encompasses catching up on activities that were delayed as a result of the pandemic, keeping in mind that this expense declined in 2020. Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2021 is $2.60 per share to $2.80 per share. Major drivers for the change between our 2020 normalized FFO of $3.26 per share and the midpoint of $2.70 from our 2021 guidance include: a $0.60 decline in same-store NOI based on the revenue and expense assumptions outlined. Keep in mind that nearly 1/3 of that decline stems from the difficult comparable period in the first quarter of 2020; a $0.07 decline primarily due to disposition activity that occurred in 2020, which is more than offset by a positive $0.14 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense, predominantly due to taking those disposition proceeds and paying down nearly $1 billion in debt in 2020; and finally, a negative $0.03 in other items. The back-loaded nature of the recovery in our NOI will also, of course, impact our NFFO numbers, which should improve on the back half of 2021. A final note on the balance sheet, our financial position remains extremely strong despite the impact of the pandemic. As I just mentioned, in 2020, we paid down nearly $1 billion of debt using disposition proceeds, extended our already long weighted average maturities to 9 years and continued to reduce our weighted average rate. This activity has positioned us extremely well, ending the year with net debt to normalized EBITDA of 5.0x, nearly $2 billion in available liquidity and very limited maturities until 2023. Our access to debt capital remains excellent positioning us well for opportunities should they present themselves. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A. Yes. So our guidance assumption at the midpoint is that as you approach the middle part of the year that we will start to see positive year-over-year lease rates. So when I guess I am talking about leasing rates in the guidance, I am thinking that we likely will be positive on blended which encompasses both by middle part of the year, encompasses both new lease and renewal rates."

At this time, I'd like to turn things over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. \nMarty McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2020 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer is with us as well for the Q&A. Please be advised that, certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now, I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I will start by thanking my 2,700 Equity Residential colleagues across the country for all they have done this year to take care of our residents and run the business under often trying circumstances. I appreciate your tireless work in meeting the needs of prospects and residents, in an environment that has been constantly changing. Shifting to the business. Our third quarter results reflect the challenges posed by the continuing health crisis and the impact it has had on living and working in the urban centers of our markets. The approximately 23% of our portfolio located in Downtown San Francisco, Manhattan and Brooklyn and Downtown, Boston and Cambridge continue to be the most impacted. When we last spoke with you in late July on our second quarter call, we were seeing demand in excess of 2019 levels and renewals that were at or near 2019 levels, albeit with significant rent reductions and concessions, leading to occupancy being generally stable. As we went through August and early September, we continue to experience good demand, but turnover increased significantly pressuring occupancy. The timing of these turnover increases PAUSE generally with the announcements by employers of delays in bringing employees back to offices, as well as incidence of civil unrest. This occupancy pressure in turn caused further rent declines and increased concessions. So far October has been broadly similar, though we have seen scattered positive signs in the form of modestly improved renewals and higher application volumes. I caution, however, that market conditions remain too volatile and the timing of developments on mitigating the virus too unclear to suggest that we have turned a corner. All that being said, we are heartened by the demand we see for our product, even in urban centers, where life has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. We also see recent office leasing activity by technology firms, as well as activity by financial services office users as a long-term vote of confidence in our urban centers. We believe that the knowledge-based economy will continue to drive growth in the U.S. and that our markets with their massive installed base of universities, innovative companies, venture capital firms, and the many other things that make a knowledge economy grow not to mention renowned entertainment and cultural amenities, will keep them at the center of this activity. The cities in which we do business, and in which many of you live and work, will again be attractive places for affluent long-term renters to live work and play once the pandemic wanes. The impact of the pandemic on increasing the ability of many office workers to remote work is certainly a fascinating new trend, whose long-term impact is difficult to gauge. But no matter what it does to longer-term office demand, we feel that our relatively young demographic craves both work proximity and proximity to the entertainment and cultural amenities in our cities, which we think will remain very attractive to affluent renters once our cities reopen fully. Also, supply in urban centers should in the midterm decline sharply, as developers, lenders and investors react to market conditions and construction costs that have not declined as of yet. While we are not providing earnings guidance, we do want you to be aware that our financial results will weaken over subsequent quarters, as the full impact from the pandemic works its way through our rent roll. Lower lease rates take some time to fully manifest themselves in our reported same-store revenue numbers, because at any one time our rent roll is made up of both new leases with lower rents and leases that were signed at higher rents prior to the beginning of the pandemic. As the composition of our rent roll changes to include more of these lower rate leases our same-store revenue results decline. The opposite is true on our way back up. Occupancy change is causing much quicker shift in the trajectory of our reported revenue numbers. In the meantime, the combination of our portfolio diversity and strong balance sheet will allow us to weather this challenging operating environment. For EQR recovery is a matter of when, not if. A quick note on collections. We continue to have strong results. We are collecting about 97% of our rents and resident payment behavior has not changed. That said, we had increased residential bad debt costs in this quarter, reflecting the fact that although in the aggregate there's only a small number of residents who have stopped paying since the pandemic began. We had a peak in July of those that reached our three-month non-payment threshold and their full balances were written off. From that point forward, only a small number of new non-payers have surfaced, so while we will continue to deal with elevated bad debt and will likely not be to the same extent seen in our third quarter numbers. On a similar note, the write-off of non-residential straight-line rent amounts in the quarter was large and lumpy and should not reoccur going forward. My final comment will be on investment activity. We closed on one acquisition in the quarter 158 unit property in suburban Seattle, and easy commuting distance for the growing job center of Bellevue. The purchase price was $48.9 million. The property is a brand-new asset in lease-up, and we expect a year two cap rate upon completion of the lease-up to be 4.7%. This is the only asset that we have purchased this year versus approximately $750 million in 2020 property sales. And this purchase is a continuation our strategy of buying urban and suburban properties, with affluent well-employed residents, the acquisition of which we believe will lead to attractive long-term cash flow and unlevered IRR growth. We will continue to buy properties using proceeds from selling assets and we think have weaker prospects, due to property condition or location or where the buyer is willing to pay a price that exceeds our estimate of fair value. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer to walk you through the markets in detail and then we'll take your questions. Michael?\nMichael Manelis: Thanks Mark. Let me start by thanking our employees for their dedication and hard work during the third quarter. This has been a year like no other and their commitment to their residents, their colleagues has been tremendous. The third quarter saw better overall demand for our apartments both urban and suburban. Suburban assets are holding up relatively well while our urban assets are producing higher turnover leading to decreased rental rates, increased use of concessions, and lower occupancy. Overall, this quarter's performance was determined as much by the density of the location urban or suburban as by the market. As we previously discussed, a little over half of our portfolio is urban, while the remainder is suburban. On a positive note, the improvement in demand across all locations resulted in a 5% increase in year-over-year movements. Resident turnover, however, was a more challenging story. After eight consecutive quarters of improving resident turnover, the third quarter of 2020 was the first quarter where the number of residents moving out increased on a year-over-year basis. Resident turnover continued to decline in the suburban markets, but the increased turnover in the urban markets more than offset this improvement. On the renewal side, as we sit here today, we are renewing just over 50% of our residents with approximately 35% of our fourth quarter renewal offers being issued with some renewal increase mostly in the suburban submarkets. Portfolio-wide occupancy is currently running just above 94%. The suburban portfolio is around 96% with the urban portfolio slightly below 93%. As I mentioned, the good news is that we continue to see more people looking for our apartments than last year. As disclosed in the release, applications at the company level were up 20% over last year in the quarter, driven by outsized growth in the urban core and this growth accelerated in October, define normal seasonal slowing. Given the amount of inventory we have available to sell in our urban portfolio, we will need to maintain this velocity through the fourth quarter or reduce turnover in order to continue to hold portfolio-wide occupancy at 94%. A stabilization and an improvement of our occupancy is what would allow us to dial back concessions and begin increasing rates. Much like applications, turnover, and occupancy, the pricing story is also bifurcated between urban and suburban. In the urban markets, pricing continued to trend down and concession usage increased throughout the quarter. 70% of the portfolio-wide concessions used during the quarter were in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Boston and Cambridge, and Downtown San Francisco. The volume of new leases is strong in these submarkets, however, price prospects continued to be very price-sensitive. Previous addresses provided on applications suggest that the large majority of these new residents are deal seekers who are moving to us from within the same market. In the suburban markets, concession use was rare and pricing was fairly stable throughout the quarter with a few submarkets beginning to show modest year-over-year growth particularly in Southern California. Now, let me move on to some market-specific commentary. Starting with Boston, elevated vacancy levels at existing properties and the inopportune recent delivery of new supply in the city will continue to challenge Boston's near-term performance. While concession use remains elevated in the city in Cambridge it has been consistent since July with about four to six weeks being the norm. Leasing activity is predominantly coming from intra-city moves with the lack of international students and workers continuing to pressure rates. Currently, we have seen some very early signs of stability with no incremental declines in rates for the last several weeks and marginal improvement in occupancy. Boston is typically highly seasonal and these albeit early signs are bucking that typical trend. For the market to fully stabilize, it will require continued improvement in the demand drivers to aid and absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated in 2021. New York continues to be one of the markets' hardest hit by the pandemic and we still see residents leaving the city to wait it out. During the quarter, leasing activity was driven by deal seekers or intra-city moves who represented approximately 75% of total move-ins. This is up 15 percentage points over last year. Meanwhile, the elevated move-outs continued with most of our residents moving to the surrounding states with suburban New Jersey capturing the largest share. In our conversations with New York-based employers and based on Mark and My's recent visit to New York, you can see early signs of the city trying to reenergize. While overall activity in the city remains meaningfully suppressed, there are absolutely a few areas where things are starting to feel a little better, specifically the Upper West and East side submarkets. Other submarkets notably Midtown, Chelsea, SoHo, and the financial district have a long way to go. Overall, we've noticed a brief period of stability beginning in late September and through October which is far better than the weekly sequential declines we experienced throughout the entire second quarter and much of the third. Currently, we are defining the usual seasonal drop-off in applications and are achieving outsized growth in weekly application counts. We have also recently seen a slowing in the pace of move-outs. However, we will continue to feel pressure on occupancy until move-outs fully normalize. Our occupancy in the market is just below 90%. Studio apartments which were once our highest occupied unit type prior to the pandemic are now our lowest at 88%. We are getting ready to furnish a few of these as many offices available for our residents who are working from home and we're going to test the demand for renting these spaces in hourly blocks of time. The good news is that New York is resilient and we strongly believe that it will remain a top destination for highly educated workers. We hear anecdotally from our local teams that residents intend to return when we get to the other side of this pandemic. Declines in rates have made living in Manhattan more affordable and that could be a catalyst to bringing people back. The broader recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply and the continued growth of big tech employers in this market. Many of these tech firms continue to expand their investments in this market, even during the pandemic, supporting the view that the city will continue to thrive as it has in the past post pandemic. Moving to D.C., which is holding up better than our other East Coast markets, but performance during the quarter moderated due to slowing Class A multifamily absorption. The market benefits from federal government employment, which has actually seen a net increase over the last 12 months, but the overall job growth has declined. The ability of our residents to pivot to work from home has allowed us to maintain occupancy with concession use that was relatively low in the quarter. We are seeing some increase in concession use and pricing pressure in this market and expect performance to moderate through the fourth quarter, partly due to normal seasonality, but also due to the continued competitive pressure from new supply. Heading over to the West Coast. Seattle began the year with strong expectations based on elevated job growth and a favorable competitive supply landscape in the downtown area for the second consecutive year. In addition, Seattle's median income within the city limits increased by 10% and crossed the $100,000 a year threshold, which makes it the third major city to do so. While Seattle was initially impacted in March by COVID, its performance through late July was very stable. Social unrest in the city and extended work from home announcements in late July and August, however, began impacting our performance, especially our ability to retain residents in the CBD Belltown and Capitol Hill submarket. Overall, market occupancy is now just below 95%, with elevated turnover during the quarter that was heavily concentrated in the Capitol Hill and CBD Belltown submarkets. Concessions, which were hardly used previously, are now starting to be seen in stabilized assets, mostly in these submarkets. Eastside properties are also using concessions, but with a lower frequency and properties to the north continue to be in the best overall shape with good year-over-year growth in the Bothell Mill Creek submarket. Overall, housing prices continue to rise at a fast pace. And along with the other factors just discussed, we would expect this market to quickly bounce back post pandemic. San Francisco is our most challenged market, although it is not the same everywhere. Overall, occupancy is now below 93%, while our downtown assets are 87%, East Bay is 96%, and both Peninsula and South Bay are currently at 94%. Since mid-March, the downtown portfolio has been pressured on rate with escalating concession use. Concessions at two months are now common downtown and what used to be a 15% to 20% rent premium between Downtown San Francisco and new supply in Downtown, Oakland is now flat to a 5% discount. As we think about the future, San Francisco should recover when there is more clarity on tech company's long-term plans regarding office versus work-from-home policies, and an improved quality of life in the downtown area. Supply in 2021 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and the South Bay. South Bay supply may challenge operations even further, unless the tech workers resume living in closer proximity to their offices. One small positive from the declines in rental rate is that, it has made the city of San Francisco, a more affordable place to live, potentially attracting more people back into the city. During October, we saw outsized growth in applications and a slight improvement in renewals. This, in turn, led to slower declines in pricing in our downtown portfolio. In Los Angeles, the urban portfolio maintained occupancy around 95% through the quarter, while contending with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown, Koreatown Mid-Wilshire Corridor. West L.A. continues to feel pressure from the slow restart of online content creation. Overall, pricing including the use of concessions has been stable since mid-September, while the application activity has continued to grow. The suburban portfolio continues to show signs of improvement with occupancy staying at or near 97%. The suburban submarkets of Inland Empire Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County are all experiencing modest year-over-year gains in rental income. That being said, we expect the overall portfolio to modestly improve through the quarter, primarily driven by continued rate improvement in the suburban submarkets. It is only fitting that I conclude our market updates with Orange County and San Diego, which stand out for their resilience through the pandemic. While our portfolio in these markets consist primarily of suburban assets, and were certainly impacted by the pandemic, they have consistently sustained occupancy above 96.5% collectively, while also improving the percent of residents renewing their leases. Both markets have year-over-year revenue gains and are expected to sustain or strengthen their performance through the fourth quarter. Overall, we haven't seen anything that leads us to believe, that the trends just discussed are likely to change meaningfully in the near term. The suburban portfolio should continue to outperform with some potential improvement in pricing and relatively stable occupancy. The urban markets will likely continue to be challenged, particularly Manhattan Brooklyn, City of Boston and Cambridge and Downtown San Francisco, where continued pressure from the increased turnover and a highly concessionary operating environment impact performance. As detailed in the release and in my remarks, we have seen tentative signs of improvement in some of the metrics in these markets, but pricing remains under significant pressure. We will need to see occupancy begin to improve and pricing to stabilize to feel like we have turned a corner. Our urban properties in Washington D.C., Seattle and L.A. will likely continue to see slight moderation in both rate and occupancy, with potentially more pressure in Seattle, where some signs of weakness have come into play of late. While the economic uncertainty and the extended impact from the pandemic have made it difficult to predict what a recovery looks like and when it may occur, we remain optimistic on a number of fronts including the ability to grow rate in our suburban portfolios, continued demand for our product regardless of location and solid collection performance. Our ongoing efforts will continue to seek out those opportunities to improve performance while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents. Thank you. At this time I will turn the call back over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first today from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Mike I appreciate all the details. You mentioned at the end that the trends are not likely to change in the near-term. So I'm wondering what the historical relationship has been between applications, which you are seeing pick up particularly in October for the urban core and ultimately occupancy or net effective new lease rate change?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I guess I would think about it this way, which is the volume of applications on a year-over-year basis is improving and it's strong but again there is seasonality to applications right? So applications are the highest in the third quarter and will drop-off in the fourth quarter. As we think about that relationship to new lease change, obviously, if we can continue this extended leasing season that we're seeing throughout the balance of October and November that should start stabilizing that occupancy and give us the ability to start dialing back some of the concession use and then ultimately try to pressure test increasing rates back up a little bit. But I think it's still too early to see what's going to happen for the balance of the quarter. But I think right now looking at where we sit at the end of October, we feel pretty good that we're seeing this extended leasing season continue. We just don't know how much longer it will continue for.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then I appreciate all the additional disclosure, and I certainly understand the lease role and the seasonality in the current operating environment, but given how much price transparency there is in the market, how many tenants with in-place leases are you seeing trying to renegotiate? And then how are you handling that?\nMichael Manelis: Well, so I think there's two aspects to that. So first is transfer. So people that are on a current lease, seeing what's available in their building and trying to move intrally, so we did see an increase in our transfer activity through the quarter. We raised our transfer fees in early April trying to mitigate some of that activity but ultimately a large percentage of those residents that are transferring are actually moving to a larger unit that has an increase in rent still. And then on the other side at the end of the lease, you are still seeing some folks trying to trade units and really going after kind of more space. So people that were in studios moving to the one-bedroom et cetera, and again at that point we're doing our best to negotiate with them to keep them in place in their current unit, but ultimately we want to retain them in as a resident. So we're going to do what we need to do to keep them.\nNick Joseph: And how about just on pure lease breaks either saying, we're looking at a unit and saying, okay, this unit is now down 20%. I may end up just moving out and paying a lease break versus renegotiated mid-lease.\nMichael Manelis: Yeah. So early lease terminations are -- continued to be elevated on a year-over-year basis we're up about 25% year-over-year. Sequentially we definitely saw July like ticked down from June, but then the announcements from the large tech companies an extended work-from-home policies and the civil unrest in the cities in early August resulted in early terminations increasing in the month of August. So far September and October remain elevated on a year-over-year basis but they're not as high as they are in August.\nMark Parrell: And just to add Nick it's Mark. We do receive lease termination payments from residents who terminate leases early. So depending on the jurisdiction that could be continuing to pay on your lease or paying us two to three months right then and there as a lease termination cost. So there is the same elevated number, but it isn't like a free option for the resident to exercise.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear next from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Mark, the first question is just on the private market values in some of your hardest hit urban cores. So if you went out and JVed or sold outright your Manhattan portfolio or your San Francisco portfolio today, would there be a sufficient bid do you think? And how would values look versus pre-COVID? \nMark Parrell: Yeah. Thanks John. I guess I'll do a quick survey and just say that if you're in the suburbs and I think this is consistent with you and others have written if you're suburban property owner of a B-property quality asset with a renewal -- or excuse me a renovation potential that probably the asset's worth a little bit more than it was pre pandemic. Class A suburban's probably about the same as it was pre pandemic. The urban stuff in San Francisco and New York would be very hard to trade. I mean, we still see total volume in the third quarter is down 60% for our kinds of assets. And even more so in New York and San Francisco. And I can't even point to completed deals to tell you what the mark is. So I'd say those markets are pretty illiquid. It's I think very logical to assume there's been some reduction in value. My guess is it's going to end up being pretty modest because a lot of folks like us who own in those markets aren't compelled sellers. And because of that you won't see us putting those assets into the market. So I think what you're probably guessing at some modest reduction in value in New York and San Francisco for sure. If we were trying to do a transaction frankly right at this moment I'm not sure how well that would go. I just think people are trying to underwrite declining rents, trying to understand the health crisis, the pandemic coming back again. And I think all of that is -- would make it quite difficult to trade these assets if we needed to do so in some kind of quick haphazard fashion. And of course we don't need to do that.\nJohn Pawlowski: Sure. Okay. And then just trying to understand your comments on the recovery is a matter of when and not if. You're very still bullish on the knowledge based economies and you are in the past cycles opportunistic. I guess, why haven't you acted on the dislocation in your stock yet? I know there's illiquidity in some of your urban markets in terms of selling assets. It just feels like there's a big dislocation in front of you and I'm just curious why you're not selling more assets to buy back stock? \nMark Parrell: Yes. I think there's two things going on in there and one is a capital allocation thought process that you laid out and there's also in our minds a risk management thought process. I mean, when we start selling assets to buy stock, which we can do that. We don't have that much tax pressure though. At some point, we would and we can't sell an unlimited number of assets and not have gain issues. But as you go through that process of taking EBITDA out of your company, taking NOI out of the company, you're increasing risk. 23% of our NOI right now is under significant pressure.  So switching to a risk management thought process from our perspective, it seems better at this point to be a little more cautious to acknowledge the uncertainty that's out there in the world whether it relates to the pandemic or the values in some of these urban markets and just sit tight and operate the portfolio hard and that's a more prudent thing to do than to go and purchase shares. Because again once that capital leaves the firm, it can't come back.  So again for us just this recycling activity we'll keep doing John because again, it's just relatively minor and we're an apartment company. That's what we do, but buying stock back to us increases risk in the firm and we just think this isn't a point in time when you want to do that. \nJohn Pawlowski: All right. So there's no big large disposition plan coming? \nMark Parrell: There are other assets that are going to be sold. We're going to sell into this bid as I mentioned for the value bid for some of this Class B renovation stuff in the suburbs. We've got properties where we don't believe in the renovation play where others may. So you should expect we'll sell into that. We may pay down some more debt. That will leave us with options, which could include a buyback at some juncture.  It will definitely include recycling into assets in these dense suburban areas and in other markets, which we've talked about on prior calls. So -- but doing a buyback right now with the pressure we're feeling on operations any uncertainty in the world at large does not seem like the right idea to us. \nJohn Pawlowski: All right. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move on to Rich Hightower with Evercore. \nRich Hightower: Hi. Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I can't believe you don't want to run EQR like a hedge fund? \nMark Parrell: It's always easier to look at these problems from the outside. \nRich Hightower: Yes. No, it certainly, it's the numbers on a spreadsheet for the rest of us, right? You guys are in a real business. But I do want to hit on the current concession environment. Michael, I know that you mentioned four to six weeks being the norm in. I think Boston was the market mentioned. But help us understand, where are we two months, where are we three months three or some of the more sort of extreme numbers in that conversation?  And then maybe a quick follow-on to that. If we fast forward a year from now and we've got all these people all this sort of induced demand as you described due to much lower rents and more affordability, more concessions and that sort of thing. What happens at the end of the lease term, what's your historical experience there when there is a bit of sticker shock 12 months out? How should we expect that to factor into occupancy and turnover a year from now? So I know it's kind of a compound question, but appreciate any color. \nMichael Manelis: Yes. So first, let me just start. I'll just give you a little bit of color on the use of concessions today. So the markets that you would expect to have the most concession use, like I said 70% of all the concessions in the quarter were in those urban cores of the New York, Boston and San Francisco. New York about 70% of all of our applications are receiving a concession just about two months right now.  San Francisco the entire market overall, it's about 50% to 60% that are receiving a concession. And we're averaging right around that 1.5 months or six weeks. But if you go to the downtown San Francisco, you're closer to about 70% to 75% of all the applications receiving two months. Everywhere else is sitting kind of right at that six week or right around that one month mark. And I think what you should expect to see as I said in the prepared remarks, as we see some stability in occupancy see this improvement in demand or demand just holding steady, we'll start dialing back some of the concessions as we work our way through the year.  As far as coming upon the renewal side of the equation a year from now, when we underwrite applicants today, we underwrite them at their gross rent regardless of the concession. So our rent as a percent of income really has not changed in the portfolio from the applications. So we're still running between the low 17% in Seattle and the high at 22.5% in San Diego. And you look at those ratios and you would say they are going to be in a position to afford an increase. They're clearly going to be in a position to afford, continuing to write the check at the rent that the writing regardless of the concession they receive when they moved in with us. So I think that's how we're thinking about a year from now. \nRich Hightower: Okay. That is helpful. And then just based on your historical experience with this sort of thing if we go back to '09, I mean is that pretty much the way it's played out back then where you underwrite a certain income rent ratio and upon renewal the tenants just sort of take it if the market is stronger. I mean, is that a pretty predictable renewal curve, or do you think there's some variability just kind of get in the unique nature of what's going on right now? \nMichael Manelis: Well, I think the extent of concession use is greater right now in the portfolio than it's ever been. So I don't know if we can look to the past down cycles and see what does that look like. I'll tell you a lot is going to depend on what the pace of the recovery is like. What do the cities feel like? What are these long-term work-from-home policies going to look like? That is going to dictate more around our concessions still being used widely in the marketplace.  If they are, we probably are not going to be able to just wipe off any concession on a year-over-year basis. We'll stair-step them back to the rents they're paying, but it's not like they're just going to go away. So a lot's going to depend about what is happening around us in that competitive market set as to how those renewals will be treated through our renewal negotiation process. \nRich Hightower: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: From Morgan Stanley, we'll hear next from Rich Hill.\nRich Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to maybe just take a step back. I think what a lot of us are trying to get our arms around is when the headwinds begin to inflect. And so from your perspective, as you think about the drivers of rent growth in your markets, is it really a job growth inflection? Is it getting people back to markets like New York City that moved away because of COVID-19? Is it just rents resetting to a lower level? Can you just walk me through like what do you think from a macro standpoint are the biggest drivers of an inflection in rent growth?\nMark Parrell: Hey, Rich, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. I guess as we think about it it's pretty predominantly related to the public health emergency. So let's spend a moment together speculating on how that might play out and that's all this is, meaning there is good reason to believe the virus will get worse. I think there's good reason to believe the vaccine will become available, especially the health workers and people that are more at risk over the next few months. And then slowly all the rest of us will get that. So you will head into the spring leasing season maybe with some positive signs on the COVID front. I mean one of the reasons you're hearing a lot of caution from us is we've got this elevated demand, which we like. We've got elevated inventory but we're also heading into the quietest time of the year. So we need to be really thoughtful about our seasonality. So not only are we fighting COVID, we're fighting seasonality. Right now we're bucking the seasonality. We're doing really well on leasing. The team's doing a great job. Rate's still suffering but what we would hope would happen just as you think about headwinds to us the most predominant headwind is COVID. Because on job growth, our resident base from what we can tell didn't lose their jobs. That was \u2013 unfortunately, people in some of these service sectors, in hospitality business, things like that and that is in our resident base. So I think a lot of our residents are well employed. They just don't care to live in some of these urban centers right now when their \u2013 these centers are disengaged and aren't as much fun to live in. And I think that a great number of those folks will come back. And the new crop of people the people that graduated from MBA programs, from technology programs and want that city experience, those folks will still want it, because that younger demographic that we mostly cater to balances safety I think and engagement entertainment differently. And I think Rich, they'll be \u2013 they'll want to come back and they'll be eager to come back if the cities are a reasonable facsimile of what they were before. So that's how we're looking at it. It doesn't mean, we're guaranteeing things are better in the spring but we're saying that the next quarter or so, we're dealing with the seasonal decline in demand as well as whatever the virus brings us. And that makes us a little more concerned.\nRich Hill: I think that makes a lot of sense. To summarize it sounds like a good old-fashioned supply versus demand technical. And as demand begins to increase as people move back, hopefully that will lead to an inflection. Is that a correct characterization?\nMark Parrell: Sure. And the comment in the press release that I made about things rolling through the financials I just want to make sure everyone understands, it isn't necessarily that things will keep getting worse and worse and worse. It's more that whatever is happening in the rent roll now, takes a quarter or so to manifest itself in reported numbers. So what will happen first is on some call in the future in some press release, Michael Manelis will tell you things have started to get better. Occupancy is firmed up. Concessions are declining. Maybe rate isn't moving yet but that famed second derivative is going in the right direction. So you'll see it in what I call the management accounting numbers before you see it in the numbers that Bob reports to you for same store revenues. So that's what we're trying. Because again we've got a pretty new group of analysts frankly on these calls. A lot of investors aren't as familiar. It's been a while since we've had a downturn. So we're just trying to make sure everyone understands how that works in the apartment business.\nRich Hill: Yes. That's very clear. Thank you for that. Just a strategic question. And maybe it goes back to one of the earlier questions and I do very much appreciate your commentary about why you don't want to buy back stock. I think that's generally not the right thing to do in markets like this. But your stock is trading at a pretty meaningful discount to private market valuations, particularly against the backdrop of low global yields. There's a lot of money on the sidelines to invest in commercial real estate. Private equity seems to be making a big push in the commercial real estate, particularly for stable cash flow assets with strong secular tailwinds. And that all sort of regulates at least back to us to the apartment sector. So I guess my question in a very long way is, is there a scenario valuations were to stay here for another six to 12 months, where you would seriously consider either a significant JV with a private company or maybe just say \"Hey look. You know what? The best thing for our shareholders is to take ourselves private.\" I recognize that's a big check and there's a lot of friction costs and I'm curious how you think about that.\nMark Parrell: Well, there's one thing you said I want to latch on to. You said the interest of PE firms. And generally, the private folks with investment dollars are very interested in the apartment sector. And you use the word stable. I would say half our business is pretty stable. A third of it in the urban centers outside New York, Boston, San Francisco is okay, but marginally weakening and then a quarter of our business is having a tough run of it. So I'd say that when you think about the buyback, like I said in some of the prior responses and when you think about any other action or interest from PE firms, there's going to be a lot of interest in the New York portfolio at the moment. That portfolio needs to find a floor on rents. It needs to have some enthusiasm and excitement in the urban center again and people moving back in. Then you'll get a floor under that. In terms of taking a company this size private I mean that's obviously a matter for the Board to consider, not for me alone to determine, but I think it's way too early to start thinking about things like that. And I would expect that at some point again when the operations of the company, especially in the urban centers feel a little more stable, we'll feel like a larger menu of capital allocation options are open to us. At that point, there'll be conversations with the Board about things like buybacks again, and other conversations. For now, I think the best thing to do is to run the portfolio hard and stay super flexible. And that's the right thing to do. \nRich Hill: All right, guy. Thank you that. Keep up the good fight.\nMark Parrell: Thank you. \nOperator: From Bank of America, we'll hear from Jeff Spector. \nJeff Spector: Great. Good morning.\nMark Parrell: Good morning. \nJeff Spector: First question, -- hi, on markets. I appreciate, your comments on knowledge-based economies and your positioning in these different cities. Just to confirm, are you saying that you and your team you're not more concerned today about any of the markets you're in for example San Fran downtown or Seattle downtown and that you're happy with your positioning? \nMichael Manelis: What I'd say about our positioning is the COVID virus the whole pandemic has just accelerated a bunch of trends. And among those is just the dispersion of high wage job growth outside the coastal centers where they used to be predominant, okay? So we have talked about adding exposure in Denver. We've talked about potentially going into Austin. There's other markets that at the right time we'll talk about with you as well. So I think you can expect that we will spread our capital around a bit more over time because I think those jobs have moved around for a lot of different reasons Jeff. I think some people just want different lifestyle. Some folks are looking to get away from maybe some, sort of, tax or political thing that they're concerned about. But I would say for the most part, our residents when you look at where affluent we think renters and the knowledge industries are -- San Francisco still has a lot of advantages as a technology center. New York still has a lot of advantages as both the technology and financial services center. Boston and the biotech in Cambridge and biotech and financial services. So -- but there are other markets that are of interest. So I would say in terms of our positioning right now I'd tell you I think we will continue as we've said I think since 2018 to add exposure in dense suburban areas where we can find affluent renters. And we'll follow our affluent renters to places like Austin and to Denver and we'll continue doing that. So you should expect that we'll continue to broaden the platform out and continue to react to that and react to things like political risk in some of our markets. But there's no risk-free apartment market. Some of the markets that you might move into have had in the past very significant supply issues don't have as big a base of high wage apartment renters. So there's -- again there's a balancing act as you enter each of these markets. \nJeff Spector: Thank you. \nMichael Manelis: Thank you. \nJeff Spector: And my follow-up question is on New York City given that is one of the weaker markets. And I believe in the earlier remarks you talked about a lot of those renters leaving for New Jersey. I live in New Jersey and I could say, I don't think many young people want to live in New Jersey. So I take that maybe as a positive. I mean when you do your exit interviews are these 20 to 30 year-olds moving back home with the parents temporarily? Like I'm just -- I know you don't know, but if there is a vaccine and this -- that could be a nice boost to the spring/summer leasing season for 2021?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So, I guess, I'll give you just a little bit of color on -- I think, I said in the prepared remarks we're definitely seeing an increase in those that are leaving the market. So we used to have about 70% -- or used to be 50%. Now it's about 70%. And New Jersey, Connecticut and California are the top three states where those that do leave are going to with suburban New Jersey is where the majority of them were going. The -- anecdotally from our doorman, from the concierge in the building are -- regardless of the demographic, whether it's young and going back with mom and dad, whether it's the older a lot of them basically are telling the doorman, telling the concierge they will be back. And they will be back as soon as we get to the other side of this pandemic. So to us that's the positive sign that we have that the renter base that we had will return. It's just a matter of when they're going to return. \nJeff Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. \nAnthony Paolone: Yeah. Thanks. Just two, I think, bigger ones. One is just to understand in California, if you're offering a resident-free rent and then next year, they renew does that -- is that impacted by the CPI plus 5% regulation, or does that only affect the face rental? Like how does that work? \nMichael Manelis: I'm not sure, we have that answer for you right at the top of our fingertips. I mean, CPI is often driven by housing in some of these places. So that is going to be approaching an 8% number under the California rules, which is a one-month concession at least. So I guess I don't -- we don't know the answer to that off the top of our heads. \nAnthony Paolone: All right. And something like San Francisco where you give someone two months of free rent when that -- if they renew does that rule kind of inhibit the ability to take those two, three months out? \nMichael Manelis: I don't believe so. I think concessions are going to be excluded from that calculation and if you held somebody's rent flat or you actually raised their rent up. But again I'm not 100% positive of that. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just second one, just given the hits and rents in the portfolio how long do you think it takes, or what are the prospects to maybe do something on the property tax side? \nMark Parrell: Yes. So, I think, it's going it's a little bit of a laggard, right? So -- on the property tax side. So right now, we're kind of beginning or prepping for the -- I'll call it hand-to-hand combat or conversations with every local jurisdiction, but it tends to run kind of on a lagging basis. You probably won't see anything or any kind of relief at least until 2021 or maybe even into 2022 based on prior experience. It's going to be that argument or that conversation about what jurisdictions are doing on the rate side relative to what they're doing on the assessment side. We're very used to this. We've done it for years and we will have those conversations. So far we haven't seen much activity, but it's really just the nature of when -- when the actual assessments or new rates and all that comes out depending on the jurisdiction. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Rich Anderson with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.\nRich Anderson: Very good. Good morning. So, it sounds like from a geographical pie chart, you kind of have some ideas about what the company might look like in the aftermath of all this down the road. But I'm wondering if anything that has happened operationally has opened your eyes to processes within the organization whether its tenant select -- resident selection credit process that maybe is -- could be sort of a cleansing event, I hate to put it that way, for the future of Equity Residential. Do you see any changes in how you run things as a result of what you've seen through all of this?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I think, early on and we talked about this on the last quarter, we saw that the exposure from corporate providers, right, we didn't have a lot to begin with. It was like at 1.5% of the portfolio. We're now down 50%. So we have fewer than 600 units right now with corporate providers. So, I think, one of the early lessons I learned is, yes, we'll probably keep that at a pretty low number throughout the portfolio. I don't think we'll bounce right back. Or if we do, we're going to have really large security deposits on hand from those kind of folks. Operationally, other than that, I think, the biggest thing that this did is, it created a catalyst for us on our sales process. And it has shown us how fast we can move to virtual leasing and how fast we can move to self-guided kind of tours and still be able to produce pretty strong application count. So I think operationally you're seeing us adjust that way to shape the business on the sales side. And we're getting ready to deploy kind of our new sales application this next month that's going to bring mobility to the sales teams and allow us to kind of have multiple assets covered by individuals. So, I think, those are probably the biggest takeaways that I've had on the learnings of these.\nRich Anderson: Okay, great. And the second question, maybe for Mark, and I don't know if we -- the best analogy might be back to 9/11 in New York. And I -- unfortunately, I wasn't there covering you back then too. And everyone said \"I'm never coming back to New York.\" Do you have a recollection of how quickly the bounce-back happened and if there's anything about that period of time that can be fast forwarded today? Because they both kind of share a similar sort of fear element to it. And I'm wondering, if that is guiding you at any way, shape or form in terms of how things might progress when we do kind of get a vaccine or some sort of therapy in place.\nMark Parrell: Yes. It's a little anecdotal for us, because though we've owned for a while in New York, we really didn't own right then. So what we know about what happened then is mostly from, frankly, our people who did work at other apartment companies or all our contacts that lived in the market. I mean, again, New York, you said it very well. The difference in population is significant. I mean, by 2016, the city was considerably more populated. And I think it might have had the highest population it ever had compared to 2001. And the obituary was clearly written on New York then. The city, Michael and I would summarize it from being there and from our conversations, talking -- New York is definitely trying to get up off the mat. If some progress can continue to hold on the virus, people want to go back. There's a special feeling to the city. People are there. There's a lot of interest. Our volume in New York is higher proportionately than anywhere else. It's just the rate is low. We just need even more demand to make up for folks that have made the decision, Rich, to move temporarily to New Jersey or whatnot and come back. So I'm probably a little less concerned with New York than I am with San Francisco, where a combination of work from home and just quality-of-life concerns and just the sort of general feeling around that -- those 10 properties we have in the city of San Francisco, that feels probably a little more concerning to me in the medium term. I think, again, as long as the pandemic by the spring starts to wane and we have it under control, I think, people want to be back in New York. And that will happen. In San Francisco, I just think it might take longer frankly.\nRich Anderson: Yes. Okay, great. Thanks Mark. Thanks, everyone.\nMark Parrell: Hey, thanks, Rich.\nOperator: We'll hear now from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Hi. Good morning. Mark and Michael, you mentioned that safety, social unrest and the lack of social engagement activities are impacting apartment demand. And unfortunately these have been very politicized issues in many core cities. I was wondering, if you are working with any political or business organizations to encourage the reopening of offices or restaurants or other businesses?\nMark Parrell: So we have significant engagement through our trade associations on all sorts of things. I don't recall being specifically engages related to reopening restaurants. We're certainly big supporters of the idea that the partnership for New York put out in their letter of getting the cities running again and being on top of everything from sanitation to just all the transit all the things that make cities fun and livable. So, I guess, our answer to that is, we're not involved day-to-day in that, but the trade associations we support are involved in those things. And we support the bigger groups of citizens and leaders and companies that are pushing for being a little more balanced here and for political leaders to take into account these business interests. \nJohn Kim: You mentioned on prior calls that moved out to buy a home was around 12% and I'm wondering if that's changed at all with the homeownership rate spiking up to 67% earlier this year.\nMichael Manelis: Yes, it actually ticked down this quarter. So we're just below 11%. We saw like a nominal pickup in the Southern California markets around Orange County and San Diego. But other than that, every market has basically declined about 1 point. \nJohn Kim: And my final question is on the bad debt expense. What percentage of that 2% does that represent as far as uncollected rent?\nMark Parrell: The majority of it -- I guess, the majority of the 2% growth, really, all of it is uncollected rent. I mean, whether that's your monthly rent or your utility reimbursement, whatever the charge is to the resident, that's the uncollected amount that's in there.\nJohn Kim: I missed to ask the question, I'm sorry. What percentage of the uncollected rent -- sorry what percent of bad debt expense is -- what percentage of the uncollected rent relating to that represents?\nMichael Manelis: So John, do you mean on -- you're breaking up a little. Do you mean rent versus say utility charges or fees, or I'm not sure we follow the question.\nJohn Kim: I'll take this off-line. I'm sorry.\nMichael Manelis: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And from Janney, we'll move to Rob Stevenson.\nRob Stevenson: Good morning guys. Just a question on the bad debt there. Mark, you said earlier your tenants weren't losing their jobs. What were the key factors in driving the bad debt higher? For some of the others, it was the elimination of the federal unemployment subsidy. But if you didn't have the unemployment what's been driving that? And is that still accelerating, or are you stabilizing at this point?\nBob Garechana: So I'd say that it's geographically focused, right? So some -- the bad debt is running higher in places like Los Angeles, which was before the pandemic, the area where you probably had the highest or the most constrained kind of rent to income levels. So you may have had probably centers or pockets, where you had a little bit more gig economy stuff. So some people have lost their jobs. We're talking about a pretty small population base in the aggregate of call it 1,100 folks that are in that bad debt piece anyways. So it's -- there is some job loss, right, but for the most part to Mark's earlier point, we think our general demographic isn't really driving it. And I'll tell you, it's been really consistent and hasn't changed much. Mark said in his prepared remarks, we had this pocket of how our policy works. But if you look at individual accounts like you've had the same accounts, they hit the 3x. They kind of peaked in July. And since then, we haven't really added very much at all to that non-payer bucket. It's actually the same kind of existing group that has just continued not to pay that is there at 9/30.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And I just would add, I mean there's some percentage of our residents who did lose their jobs, did have situations like Bob mentioned. They could be gig workers in the content industry in L.A. There's also public policy reasons. Some people aren't paying, because they feel like they don't have to. And we continue to pursue those folks. And within the bounds of the law, we'll be relentless in that matter. I mean, there's a contractual obligation here, but we also want to work with people. I mean, if there's some understanding that they need from us, they need some more time, we've got a good number of payment plans out there. So you made your comment. I think you're right. There's some folks where that government supplement mattered. That didn't matter as much to us, but there was a few employees -- or a few people excuse me residents of ours that did lose their jobs and that's certainly in the number that we wrote off in the quarter. But there is some of that that's likely behavior-driven and that's something that will work itself out over the next whatever number of quarters.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then, how are you guys feeling about the California vote next week? And is there any of this type of legislature or ballot initiatives in other markets that haven't got as much attention that you guys are worried about?\nBob Garechana: Sure. So we remain reasonably confident on defeating Prop 21. I think the industry is well organized. Barry Altshuler, who's one of our senior investment guys is the President of the California Apartment Association with other industry leaders. He's just led a really great campaign to educate people in California. That Prop 21 doesn't create a single unit new unit of affordable housing. It doesn't put anyone who's homeless into a home. All it does is discourage investment in our markets in housing. So I think what we feel as we've made a good case. Things have changed in terms of the way the vote will be tabulated. I mean it's all remote. It wouldn't surprise us if it continued past the actual election day as maybe more than one election will in the U.S., but we feel pretty good about it. There was a good poll in one of the Southern California papers on this as well. So at this moment, we're feeling reasonably confident, but it's a presidential election year. A lot more people will be voting than voted in 2018 and we'll keep making our case to the people in the state of California all the way through November 3.\nRob Stevenson: Okay.\nBob Garechana: And in terms of vote places, yes there's not a lot. There's a ballot measure in Colorado that would raise property taxes for residential both homeownership and apartment owners and stuff like that, but it's just not nearly as significant as Prop 21. So that's where for us at least most of the action is.\nRob Stevenson: And anything working its way through the legislature in New York or Massachusetts or elsewhere in California?\nBob Garechana: Sure. Well we'll do a quick survey. So Washington state, they're obviously they're going to have their legislative election. There's been some discussion there about California-tyle rent control, meaning a CPI plus and inclusive of vacancy decontrol. The industry continues to talk about that with them. There's some real downsides to part of that approach, but we're engaging in that conversation. As you go across a little less pressure in Massachusetts, certainly New York has its own set of elections in a week and we'll see what that ends up being. But I would imagine there's always things to talk about in New York, but there isn't anything on the hopper. And as I understand, it the general assembly isn't in session. So we don't need to worry about that at the moment. Washington D.C. city council is considering various rent control measures, a few of which are highly negative. We don't think those are likely to go through. We're having constructive conversations there through our trade association. So there's always things that we're looking into Rob and we're always out there supporting. And we have a pretty active engagement with policymakers and when it's a ballot proposal with the whole electorate on this stuff. And usually, once you have the conversations, you and explain what's really going to happen here the emotional satisfaction of rent control, usually fades away because it doesn't work. I mean universally academics tell you it doesn't work and the market experience shows it doesn't work. And we try and talk about ways to improve zoning, to create private incentives, so that people are out there building more affordable. So that's really the battle.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nBob Garechana: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear now from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey. Good afternoon here, good morning to you. Hey, Mark. So I guess first question. Just curious on your views on the extension of eviction moratoriums here in California and New York recently. I guess I'm curious, how much of a risk you think that poses indirectly and directly to apartment of portfolios and your portfolios in those markets?\nMark Parrell: So we're fortunate with these eviction moratoriums instead high-quality resident base where again our people are getting great service. I mean, I read all these comments Haendel and it's really awesome that we get from the people that work for Michael and on site. And it's folks that interact with our service personnel, our customers, our residents, interact with our concierge, with our on-site staff. And they say, terrific things. So a lot of our people they don't hate their landlord. They like their experience with us. They think we're doing a good job. They appreciate how hard we work during the pandemic to keep them safe. So the good news for us is, most of our residents pay and that's not a problem. In terms of these eviction moratorium which have been tough on a lot of more affordable landlords I think the right answer is, what the industry has been pushing National Multi Housing Council and others which is the proposal, the idea of putting more cash in the pockets of renters so they can pay their rent. The idea of putting this loss entirely on landlords and breaking the residential housing system in the United States is just a terrible idea in the long run. And I think the answer is, if the need is great then we as taxpayers have to shoulder that burden. Congress needs to appropriate the money. President needs to sign the law and the money needs to go either directly to landlords or to residents who are in need so they can make their payments. So landlords in turn -- I mean EQR for example our biggest single expense is $400 million a year in property taxes. That in turn support all the first responders, in these hard-pressed municipalities and stuff and as well as our significant payroll costs and keeping our properties up. So I guess Haendel, it's about having that conversation with people and explaining the whole, I've heard it called connected ecosystem here. I mean so -- but again for EQR it hasn't been quite as big an issue yet, but I think in the long run these eviction moratoriums are pretty awful idea. And I think they become less and less justifiable as time goes on. \nHaendel St. Juste: I appreciate the thoughts there. Second question and I'm not going on New York City, but from a different perspective and I guess you have to have a little bit of patience here understanding the number of questions on New York City already, but I wanted to go back. And really the question that I asked you last quarter when we discussed well, I asked you when you thought New York could return to positive same-store NOI territory. I think at that point in July we and many investors were expecting NOI to sort of like continue to decline into early next year with the trough in New York City not occurring until spring and maybe middle of next year and a positive return potentially by the second half of 2022. Now since that July call obviously operating conditions have clearly remained and probably gotten a bit more challenging with concessions even more prevalent here. So I guess in my mind, is it fair to assume or expect that timeline to that potentially positive same-store NOI now shifting to now 2023, even if we get a vaccine and the pandemic starts to wane next spring, just given the level of concessions now being offered how deep into the year and basically the size of the hole you're not climbing out from here? \nMark Parrell: Wow. A lot in that question. I'm hesitant to give you guidance. I mean we don't have any formal guidance. And I'm hesitant to suggest any particular quarter for things changing on the NOI front. It doesn't mean that we have pessimism. It's just impossible with the public health emergency to predict. But I will tease this color out. Again on the rate side it, takes a while for it to go negative and a while for it to go positive. And that's what we've been talking about. The little offhand comment we made was on occupancy. Right now we have buildings that are occupied in the high 80s that are very desirable buildings. And when New York becomes New York again and people move back, that improvement in occupancy will be immediate. And that will go to the top line immediately and to the NOI number you referred to. So rate takes a while both up and down. This was quick because there was so much pressure. On the way up, you should expect it will take a while on rates to get rid of the concessions start moving rate. That will take a little while, but the occupancy boost will feel more immediate. And unfortunately I mean this portfolio was running 97%. Right now this morning we're 89.9%. So right at 90% as Michael said. You could make up 7 points in occupancy, if the city became the city again pretty quick. And again, I'm not predicting when that occurs, but I think there's an occupancy opportunity for us but which quarter it all occurs just depends on when the virus gets better. \nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. And last one if you'll indulge me the obligatory political elections question on what perhaps the implications of a potential Biden victory would mean for coastal little bit of markets like New York, San Francisco Boston and the CBD portfolios there. And how would you view the odds of perhaps potential direct stimulus after some of these markets and maybe balance that against perhaps a rollback in some of the mortgage tax deduction ceilings that we put in place during the Trump tax cut? So just at a high level just curious on your views on what a potential Biden victory would mean and perhaps some of the policy initiatives that could play out and what that means for your portfolio? Thanks.\nBob Garechana: Yes. So because that also depends on who controls the Senate and whether the House stays where it is now and -- but it's really hard to speculate on. I mean I think it's pretty well understood the programs people have. I mean some of the things you didn't mention for example, more certainty on immigration and more positive immigration policies would be helpful to us. More regulation would generally not be positive for us. Some things like taxes changing may create more or less economic growth. So it's hard for me to say that, EQR is a particular dog in this fight and I'm hesitant to get involved in any of that. So -- but I do think the mortgage tax thing it wasn't a big impact on us before when they took it away, so I doubt it will matter very much here to us at all. I think a stimulus package to me, I think after the election's done, I would guess there's a pretty high chance that that will get done because once the election's done given how frail the stock market and the economy feel, I think the politicians will look at each other and go, okay we need to do this now and there's not as much risk to the election is over and there's no benefit to be gained from waiting. So I guess, I'm sort of expecting some stimulus to happen after the election. That seems like the bedding line out there regardless of who wins. \nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Thank you for your time and I will look forward. Thank you.\nBob Garechana: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move on to Alexander Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. \nAlexander Kalmus: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Digging into the applications, what does the credit quality look like versus history? And how does the conversion process from application to lease compare, are you seeing a rent price bid-ask spreads of any kind?\nMichael Manelis: So, I think I said earlier, we do not change our underwriting criteria at all. So, applicants coming in are run and screened against the growth rent, regardless of concessions. And we really didn't see a material shift in the affordability index, which is rent as a percent of income across any of our markets, where we range still between that 17% and 23%. As far as -- can you give me the last part of that question?\nBob Garechana: Just a credit quality question.\nAlexander Kalmus: Yes. If there's a spread between a rent, maybe the price that they're throwing out for a unit that is maybe a low-ball offer. Or are you seeing more of that versus real legitimate prospects?\nMichael Manelis: No. I mean this is legitimate prospects. I think one of the parts of the question I forgot, which was the closing ratio. So the way to think about kind of, typically you would have foot traffic those that come in for the virtual tour or a self-guided tour, about 25% of the time that converts into an application. And that closing ratio has been fairly consistent. We had a little bit of a change when we got into the initial COVID period, but right now it's fairly stable in our ability to convert kind of that traffic to applications. But really not seeing anything from a quality of the renter or the quality of the applicant showing up for these units.\nMark Parrell: And I want to add, Alex. People, who are applying for us, are putting down a deposit and paying a fee. So when they're involved with us, it isn't -- you make it sound like it's a little bit of a bid. I mean at that point, we've sort of agreed on price with them, subject to a credit and criminal background check review. And they move -- the great preponderance of those people end up moving in with us. So applications for us, just so you understand, are a forward indicator of move-ins. This month's applications are next month's move-ins, and are -- that month's reduction in left to lease and that next month's increase in occupancy. Maybe that helps you. So the quality -- and we do qualify people based on the rent without the concession, just to be really clear about that. So they can afford to pay the face rent, not just the rent, reduced on some effective basis by the concession.\nAlexander Kalmus: Got it. Appreciate the color there. And then, so looking at a little different question here. The performance of nonresidential real estate asset touches overall, even underperformed, a lot of the residential sector that we see. Are you hearing of any conversions from hotels or offices or even retail into new apartment buildings in urban centers?\nMark Parrell: Yeah, there were some -- it's Mark. There were some discussion Alex, we've heard from our people in Southern California, both hospitality plays, strip centers in the Los Angeles area strip retail, of which there's a fair amount that might go residential. So there is some conversation, and I've heard about it, particularly in Southern California as to both hospitality and retail. There's other spots we've been involved with shopping center owners, and thinking about repurposing out lots and things like that. So there's a fair bit of conversation on that. But, again most recently, I've heard a fair bit about it in Southern Cal.\nAlexander Kalmus: Got it. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. So, just a question on your urban core, it's helpful you guys break out the occupancy now. Do you have any stats on -- if we look at the drop in occupancy that was very visible in the urban core? How much of those renters stayed in the market versus left the urban core. Do you have any sense on that? \nMichael Manelis: Yeah. Well, I think I shared a little bit of that before, like in New York that we saw an increase of those leaving. So both, New York and San Francisco, probably saw the most pronounced increases of those leaving that MSA but staying nearby, moving to kind of other nearby market, that may have more concentration of suburban-type properties in there.\nNick Yulico: Okay. But you don't have any specific stats you can share about -- because you've obviously framed this as an issue where occupancy is a problem, because people are leaving the urban core. They may come back, but how are you sure that you're not just losing out to other properties? And I guess I'm wondering whether you guys feel like you are competitive right now with your concessions or if there's some elements of this occupancy drop that's happening in the urban core are residents, who are going to the developer down the road is just getting an even bigger concession package.\nMichael Manelis: Yeah. So, I guess, I would say -- I think I've said it a couple of times now. In those urban cores, you're absolutely seeing people leave those downtown areas and go to other nearby markets with some upticks like in New York that actually leave the state entirely. So, as you think about the moves intra-city, so are we losing residents that then go to competitors in the market? I guess I will tell you that our renewal process is set up in such a way to handle those negotiations, not only on site but then as soon as somebody does give us a notice, we leverage our national call center to place calls to those residents, just to make sure there is nothing we can do within reason to keep them. And for the most part this is not a rate play. So, I'm sure there are a few that leave us and go somewhere to some concession offer that is just outside of the market boundaries, but a very small percentage of those residents that leave us are doing that to us. The other way to think about it is the increased volume of applications that we're seeing right now, is a pretty good indicator from a market competitive standpoint of our pricing. If we were not competitive, we would not be seeing new leases coming to us.\nNick Yulico: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear now from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you. Thank you, and good morning out there. So. two questions. The first one, one of the -- one of my peers asked earlier about the ability to reassess on the property tax given the drop in NOIs, but obviously that takes time. You guys have been very efficient on OpEx and on the G&A front, but still as you look at the rent declines, do you see an ability to offset some of that on the expense or G&A side, or you guys have gotten yourself so lean and then also on the capital markets side refinanced so much debt that there's really not much additional that you can do from either a cost or interest expense side? \nMark Parrell : Hey, Alex, it's Mark. We're going to split that up. I'm going to ask Bob to talk about capital markets and the debt maturity, we got coming next year that's at pretty high rate. He can go through in a second. On our end, you're going to see that in the quarter at least G&A and property management, our overhead categories collectively were down, I think, it was 10% or 15%. You should expect that to continue. I mean, we're certainly responsive to the fact that cash flow's going down and overhead needs to follow that. So, there'll continue to be adjustments in that regard. I don't feel like we have a lot of folks that aren't being well utilized. I think it's just a matter of what is going to be sort of bonus compensation, those sorts of things. That's where the discussions lie. And then just running the business more efficiently, Michael talked earlier about he did in terms of remote leasing. That certainly has impacts on headcount. So things like that. So you should expect that we will be just as relentless. I'm not -- again, I don't feel like we have a lot of people sitting around on their hands, but I do think we need to be responsive to the fact that NOIs are going down and overhead needs to respond to that. And you can see in the third quarter, it did and you should expect it will continue to.\nBob Garechana: And on the balance sheet side, Alex as you think about it, you've got the big maturity the $750 million maturity in 2021. That does carry a 4.625% coupon, and we could refinance that today on a 10-year basis at call it 2%. So there is still a positive arbitrage between the refinancing activity going forward. So that exists frankly if you look at our maturity schedule on Page 2018 not just in 2021, but continue in 2022 based on where -- and 2023, despite the fact that we don't have a ton of debt maturing.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is going back on Haendel's question. Mark, as you look at the markets over time, there's definitely been a shift in the past certainly two decades, more rent control or more rent control used in markets the eviction moratoriums, I mean, there's a lot more housing regulation in coastal markets that we didn't previously have. Additionally, they're talking in progressive ways about rent moratoriums or rent write-offs or national rent regulations, et cetera, if the demo suite. So, certainly, there's a lot there. How do you think about just overall when you guys originally looked at your current portfolio and all the factors that drove you to these markets versus the political changes that have happened now and maybe also price point changes, where maybe you get a more lower -- more of a broader mix, et cetera. So if you look at the overall EQR portfolio now, do you feel that the original trends that you saw that got you into these markets are still there, or you would say, hey guys, there's some things that have shifted on the political and on the affordability side that we should reassess. And maybe while these markets will come back, because they're viable they're going to be different and maybe we want to be positioned more differently than just waiting for the markets to come back.\nBob Garechana: Yeah, I don't think we're just going to wait for the markets to come back. I think political risk has changed in our markets. I think when we thought about this shift into urban 15 years ago. One of the reasons we liked the urban centers was it was politically difficult to build, that the politics created a supply constraint that we like. So to be honest some of the markets were chosen with some of that in mind, Alex. And then as time has gone on, I would say what's happened is that there's this bit of a bias against landlords. There's a bit of a regulatory mindset that is challenging to work through and we do think political risk is higher in our markets. And one of the reasons to spread our capital out both in the suburbs of our markets, because a lot of rent control and rent regulation is local, okay? Some of it is at the state level, but a lot of it is local. So you might want to be in a metro, but you may not be want to be exactly where you were in the center before. So you should expect we'll continue responding to that risk by spreading out and also going into some metros where the supply risk may actually be worse in some of those other metros we're not in, but you're getting some compensating political risk benefits. I'll also say that you didn't mention it quite as much, but the fiscal situation is quite concerning in some of our markets by the way also in some markets we're not in, okay? So, there's plenty of municipalities under a lot of stress. That's another thing we keep in mind. So, whenever we buy an asset, we underwrite or develop an asset. Two, we underwrite the locality, the county, the state and how it looks from a financial perspective and think about as a land -- long-term owner of this property whether that's a risk we're willing to take. So, I think we're pretty focused on managing our existing political risk by having like, again, this big outreach to politicians and to policymakers we talked about and then secondarily just over time shifting some of our capital to places that maybe are a little friendlier in that regard.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then just one final if I could. You guys mentioned on your California residents are very happy in renting. Are you -- are all of the tenants who are taking advantage of this optionality if they can -- to pay or not pay. Are all of those tenants now out? Have you let those people just leave with a minimal break fee, or do you still have a bunch of California residents who are sort of living rent-free?\nMark Parrell: So, Alex, we believe in the sanctity of contract both ways. And so these people we don't have the ability to evict them. So, there are some number of people that can pay that haven't. We'll continue to monitor that situation. Again, we're always willing to -- some people haven't even communicated with us. We talked about ghosting on the last call and had a little fun with that, but we've got to have these conversations with people figure out how we can help them, how they can meet their contractual obligation to pay rent and how we can move forward. There is no rent forgiveness program at Equity Residential.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you, Mark.\nMark Parrell: Thanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator: And from Baird, we'll move to Amanda Sweitzer.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow-up on some of your election comments. You guys evaluated all the potential benefit to your portfolio integration reform? And then do you have any data on either what proportion of your residential are skilled immigrants or which of your markets may benefit the most for immigration reform.\nMichael Manelis: I think what I can give you is just a little bit of backdrop which is, last year this time about 7% in of our applications were coming from those residents outside of the United States. At present, we're down to about 2%, for the third quarter of 2020. So I think changes -- positive changes in the immigration policy that allow us to get back to where we were, would be a catalyst for some of the recoveries in some of those major markets where we're feeling more pressure right now.\nAmanda Morgan: That's helpful. And just the 7% of applications that you mentioned, were those concentrated in any particular markets, or was it pretty widely distributed?\nMichael Manelis: I guess, I would tell you that it's the major mar -- it is Boston, San Francisco and New York, that you see the biggest changes on this year-over-year basis.\nAmanda Morgan: Okay. That's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks.\nMichael Manelis: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take a follow-up from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: Hi. It's Michael Bilerman here for Nick. Just two quick questions, one, Mark you talked a little bit about, how taxes play into somewhat of your ability to sell substantial assets and do buybacks. One of the public apartment peers did a large joint venture and also doing a spin-off. Can you talk about whether either of those would work for EQR? And if not, why?\nMark Parrell: Sure. So again, I don't understand all the back and forth on the tax side with our peer. But I would say that most joint venture transactions when you're keeping the cash. And you're the 40-plus percent seller, which does create gain, unless you do a lot of structuring things that create other risks. So doing a JV is great to prove value to create diversification to get new capital and all those other things. But in terms of it being a great way to sell an asset it isn't a whole lot different than just selling it out, right. So I guess I'd say on the tax side, I look at the JV and I look at an asset sale relatively similarly. Now if a JV partner, an institutional investor wanted to be in with us in a market. And they would provide a better price and better terms on the portion they were purchasing, because they are differently correlated than just the straight up buyers, we'd be interested in that we're open minded. We have very few JVs, but we've done many in the past. And so, I guess, I'd say, Michael, we're open to doing some JVs at some of our assets and maybe some of our urban assets if the price made sense to us. But it -- getting cash out and buying stock back just to use the most obvious example, is a pretty hard thing to do at least in great size, without triggering some kind of special dividend requirement or really stressing your tax situation.\nMichael Bilerman: And then specifically then on the second part on, spinning or doing something to effectuate on an increased tax basis, does that have any -- does that resonate at all with the Board or with you or it just does not makes sense?\nMark Parrell: Every company has got its own goals and motives, but the way I've been taught for years is to not pay taxes earlier, than you need to. And so there isn't a great deal of desire on the part of our Board to create a taxable event, just so that the company has more flexibility in selling assets. So if we need that flexibility, we can manage that at the time. And we did do a special dividend before. And that's because giving capital back to the shareholders, in that case made so much sense. So I guess I'd rather address that on an as-needed basis, rather than do it in some parameter fashion.\nMichael Bilerman: Yeah. And then, just lastly just coming back on the application data and appreciate splitting up the portfolio and giving us the different pieces. I assume the increase in applications is also a matter of increased vacancy right? Because no one's going to apply for apartments that are fully leased, you've got to create vacant -- you have to have vacancy for more applications. And so you have 80,000 or so units. Almost 5,000 of them are vacant today. You talked about that 1,100 that are not paying their rent for more than three months. So do you have like at least the history on just numbers that go behind the percentages? And then, how those -- how coincident how lagging they may be just to sort of get the history of occupancy and applications over time, so that we can use these numbers as a potential leading indicator to occupancies moving up?\nMichael Manelis: Yeah. So I guess I'll kind of frame it. So at a total portfolio level, the applications in the third quarter were call it $12,700. And that's compared to $10,700 last year there's definitely seasonality components to those applications. So you will see applications that hit a peak in June or July, call it at 4,000 or 5,000 applications a month. They'll drop down to 2,000 a month or 2,400 a month in November and December. So I would look at this as just the indicator that we are seeing, an extended leasing season. Your point about available inventory is dead on. We need the applications to be running 120%. We actually needed them to be like 125%, in the third quarter just so that we could have held on to the occupancy that we had in the beginning. So A lot of this is just the trade out between if retention starts to improve, we start to renew more residents, then that takes a little bit of pressure off the front door. But if we're going to continue to renew residents call it at 50% 50% of that we will need applications running, 120%, 130%, over prior year.\nBob Garechana: Yeah. That's a great point about we'll continue to try in our materials for NAREIT to continue to elaborate on that, because the virtuous cycle for us the beginning of improvement begins with retention improving and with applications holding. They don't have to go up from here and likely won't just given seasonally where we are, but continuing to outperform on applications which again a month later are move-ins and doing better on renewals especially in these urban markets. That will start solidifying occupancy. That will start giving Michael confidence to start removing concessions. So we absolutely will try and be as clear as we can about, historical trends. And you've been around a long time. So this gets confused with you've got this cycle win this economic cycle on top of just our seasonal cycle. So you have two things going on. We may tell you in December that, applications went down but they're still three times what they normally are in December, right? But they're less than November. So we'll try and do a good job of being clear on those things.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it Bob.\nBob Garechana: Thank you.\nOperator: Gentlemen, at this time, I'd like to turn things back to you for closing remarks.\nMark Parrell: Well, we thank you for the interest in Equity Residential for sticking with us on a long call. And we wish everyone well. Thanks.\nOperator: And that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for attending. Everyone now has left the call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. Let me start by thanking our employees for their dedication and hard work during the third quarter. This has been a year like no other and their commitment to their residents, their colleagues has been tremendous. The third quarter saw better overall demand for our apartments both urban and suburban. Suburban assets are holding up relatively well while our urban assets are producing higher turnover leading to decreased rental rates, increased use of concessions, and lower occupancy. Overall, this quarter's performance was determined as much by the density of the location urban or suburban as by the market. As we previously discussed, a little over half of our portfolio is urban, while the remainder is suburban. On a positive note, the improvement in demand across all locations resulted in a 5% increase in year-over-year movements. Resident turnover, however, was a more challenging story. After eight consecutive quarters of improving resident turnover, the third quarter of 2020 was the first quarter where the number of residents moving out increased on a year-over-year basis. Resident turnover continued to decline in the suburban markets, but the increased turnover in the urban markets more than offset this improvement. On the renewal side, as we sit here today, we are renewing just over 50% of our residents with approximately 35% of our fourth quarter renewal offers being issued with some renewal increase mostly in the suburban submarkets. Portfolio-wide occupancy is currently running just above 94%. The suburban portfolio is around 96% with the urban portfolio slightly below 93%. As I mentioned, the good news is that we continue to see more people looking for our apartments than last year. As disclosed in the release, applications at the company level were up 20% over last year in the quarter, driven by outsized growth in the urban core and this growth accelerated in October, define normal seasonal slowing. Given the amount of inventory we have available to sell in our urban portfolio, we will need to maintain this velocity through the fourth quarter or reduce turnover in order to continue to hold portfolio-wide occupancy at 94%. A stabilization and an improvement of our occupancy is what would allow us to dial back concessions and begin increasing rates. Much like applications, turnover, and occupancy, the pricing story is also bifurcated between urban and suburban. In the urban markets, pricing continued to trend down and concession usage increased throughout the quarter. 70% of the portfolio-wide concessions used during the quarter were in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Boston and Cambridge, and Downtown San Francisco. The volume of new leases is strong in these submarkets, however, price prospects continued to be very price-sensitive. Previous addresses provided on applications suggest that the large majority of these new residents are deal seekers who are moving to us from within the same market. In the suburban markets, concession use was rare and pricing was fairly stable throughout the quarter with a few submarkets beginning to show modest year-over-year growth particularly in Southern California. Now, let me move on to some market-specific commentary. Starting with Boston, elevated vacancy levels at existing properties and the inopportune recent delivery of new supply in the city will continue to challenge Boston's near-term performance. While concession use remains elevated in the city in Cambridge it has been consistent since July with about four to six weeks being the norm. Leasing activity is predominantly coming from intra-city moves with the lack of international students and workers continuing to pressure rates. Currently, we have seen some very early signs of stability with no incremental declines in rates for the last several weeks and marginal improvement in occupancy. Boston is typically highly seasonal and these albeit early signs are bucking that typical trend. For the market to fully stabilize, it will require continued improvement in the demand drivers to aid and absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated in 2021. New York continues to be one of the markets' hardest hit by the pandemic and we still see residents leaving the city to wait it out. During the quarter, leasing activity was driven by deal seekers or intra-city moves who represented approximately 75% of total move-ins. This is up 15 percentage points over last year. Meanwhile, the elevated move-outs continued with most of our residents moving to the surrounding states with suburban New Jersey capturing the largest share. In our conversations with New York-based employers and based on Mark and My's recent visit to New York, you can see early signs of the city trying to reenergize. While overall activity in the city remains meaningfully suppressed, there are absolutely a few areas where things are starting to feel a little better, specifically the Upper West and East side submarkets. Other submarkets notably Midtown, Chelsea, SoHo, and the financial district have a long way to go. Overall, we've noticed a brief period of stability beginning in late September and through October which is far better than the weekly sequential declines we experienced throughout the entire second quarter and much of the third. Currently, we are defining the usual seasonal drop-off in applications and are achieving outsized growth in weekly application counts. We have also recently seen a slowing in the pace of move-outs. However, we will continue to feel pressure on occupancy until move-outs fully normalize. Our occupancy in the market is just below 90%. Studio apartments which were once our highest occupied unit type prior to the pandemic are now our lowest at 88%. We are getting ready to furnish a few of these as many offices available for our residents who are working from home and we're going to test the demand for renting these spaces in hourly blocks of time. The good news is that New York is resilient and we strongly believe that it will remain a top destination for highly educated workers. We hear anecdotally from our local teams that residents intend to return when we get to the other side of this pandemic. Declines in rates have made living in Manhattan more affordable and that could be a catalyst to bringing people back. The broader recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply and the continued growth of big tech employers in this market. Many of these tech firms continue to expand their investments in this market, even during the pandemic, supporting the view that the city will continue to thrive as it has in the past post pandemic. Moving to D.C., which is holding up better than our other East Coast markets, but performance during the quarter moderated due to slowing Class A multifamily absorption. The market benefits from federal government employment, which has actually seen a net increase over the last 12 months, but the overall job growth has declined. The ability of our residents to pivot to work from home has allowed us to maintain occupancy with concession use that was relatively low in the quarter. We are seeing some increase in concession use and pricing pressure in this market and expect performance to moderate through the fourth quarter, partly due to normal seasonality, but also due to the continued competitive pressure from new supply. Heading over to the West Coast. Seattle began the year with strong expectations based on elevated job growth and a favorable competitive supply landscape in the downtown area for the second consecutive year. In addition, Seattle's median income within the city limits increased by 10% and crossed the $100,000 a year threshold, which makes it the third major city to do so. While Seattle was initially impacted in March by COVID, its performance through late July was very stable. Social unrest in the city and extended work from home announcements in late July and August, however, began impacting our performance, especially our ability to retain residents in the CBD Belltown and Capitol Hill submarket. Overall, market occupancy is now just below 95%, with elevated turnover during the quarter that was heavily concentrated in the Capitol Hill and CBD Belltown submarkets. Concessions, which were hardly used previously, are now starting to be seen in stabilized assets, mostly in these submarkets. Eastside properties are also using concessions, but with a lower frequency and properties to the north continue to be in the best overall shape with good year-over-year growth in the Bothell Mill Creek submarket. Overall, housing prices continue to rise at a fast pace. And along with the other factors just discussed, we would expect this market to quickly bounce back post pandemic. San Francisco is our most challenged market, although it is not the same everywhere. Overall, occupancy is now below 93%, while our downtown assets are 87%, East Bay is 96%, and both Peninsula and South Bay are currently at 94%. Since mid-March, the downtown portfolio has been pressured on rate with escalating concession use. Concessions at two months are now common downtown and what used to be a 15% to 20% rent premium between Downtown San Francisco and new supply in Downtown, Oakland is now flat to a 5% discount. As we think about the future, San Francisco should recover when there is more clarity on tech company's long-term plans regarding office versus work-from-home policies, and an improved quality of life in the downtown area. Supply in 2021 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and the South Bay. South Bay supply may challenge operations even further, unless the tech workers resume living in closer proximity to their offices. One small positive from the declines in rental rate is that, it has made the city of San Francisco, a more affordable place to live, potentially attracting more people back into the city. During October, we saw outsized growth in applications and a slight improvement in renewals. This, in turn, led to slower declines in pricing in our downtown portfolio. In Los Angeles, the urban portfolio maintained occupancy around 95% through the quarter, while contending with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown, Koreatown Mid-Wilshire Corridor. West L.A. continues to feel pressure from the slow restart of online content creation. Overall, pricing including the use of concessions has been stable since mid-September, while the application activity has continued to grow. The suburban portfolio continues to show signs of improvement with occupancy staying at or near 97%. The suburban submarkets of Inland Empire Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County are all experiencing modest year-over-year gains in rental income. That being said, we expect the overall portfolio to modestly improve through the quarter, primarily driven by continued rate improvement in the suburban submarkets. It is only fitting that I conclude our market updates with Orange County and San Diego, which stand out for their resilience through the pandemic. While our portfolio in these markets consist primarily of suburban assets, and were certainly impacted by the pandemic, they have consistently sustained occupancy above 96.5% collectively, while also improving the percent of residents renewing their leases. Both markets have year-over-year revenue gains and are expected to sustain or strengthen their performance through the fourth quarter. Overall, we haven't seen anything that leads us to believe, that the trends just discussed are likely to change meaningfully in the near term. The suburban portfolio should continue to outperform with some potential improvement in pricing and relatively stable occupancy. The urban markets will likely continue to be challenged, particularly Manhattan Brooklyn, City of Boston and Cambridge and Downtown San Francisco, where continued pressure from the increased turnover and a highly concessionary operating environment impact performance. As detailed in the release and in my remarks, we have seen tentative signs of improvement in some of the metrics in these markets, but pricing remains under significant pressure. We will need to see occupancy begin to improve and pricing to stabilize to feel like we have turned a corner. Our urban properties in Washington D.C., Seattle and L.A. will likely continue to see slight moderation in both rate and occupancy, with potentially more pressure in Seattle, where some signs of weakness have come into play of late. While the economic uncertainty and the extended impact from the pandemic have made it difficult to predict what a recovery looks like and when it may occur, we remain optimistic on a number of fronts including the ability to grow rate in our suburban portfolios, continued demand for our product regardless of location and solid collection performance. Our ongoing efforts will continue to seek out those opportunities to improve performance while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents. Thank you. At this time I will turn the call back over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Well, I guess I would think about it this way, which is the volume of applications on a year-over-year basis is improving and it's strong but again there is seasonality to applications right? So applications are the highest in the third quarter and will drop-off in the fourth quarter. As we think about that relationship to new lease change, obviously, if we can continue this extended leasing season that we're seeing throughout the balance of October and November that should start stabilizing that occupancy and give us the ability to start dialing back some of the concession use and then ultimately try to pressure test increasing rates back up a little bit. But I think it's still too early to see what's going to happen for the balance of the quarter. But I think right now looking at where we sit at the end of October, we feel pretty good that we're seeing this extended leasing season continue. We just don't know how much longer it will continue for. Well, so I think there's two aspects to that. So first is transfer. So people that are on a current lease, seeing what's available in their building and trying to move intrally, so we did see an increase in our transfer activity through the quarter. We raised our transfer fees in early April trying to mitigate some of that activity but ultimately a large percentage of those residents that are transferring are actually moving to a larger unit that has an increase in rent still. And then on the other side at the end of the lease, you are still seeing some folks trying to trade units and really going after kind of more space. So people that were in studios moving to the one-bedroom et cetera, and again at that point we're doing our best to negotiate with them to keep them in place in their current unit, but ultimately we want to retain them in as a resident. So we're going to do what we need to do to keep them. Yeah. So early lease terminations are -- continued to be elevated on a year-over-year basis we're up about 25% year-over-year. Sequentially we definitely saw July like ticked down from June, but then the announcements from the large tech companies an extended work-from-home policies and the civil unrest in the cities in early August resulted in early terminations increasing in the month of August. So far September and October remain elevated on a year-over-year basis but they're not as high as they are in August. Yes. So first, let me just start. I'll just give you a little bit of color on the use of concessions today. So the markets that you would expect to have the most concession use, like I said 70% of all the concessions in the quarter were in those urban cores of the New York, Boston and San Francisco. New York about 70% of all of our applications are receiving a concession just about two months right now.  San Francisco the entire market overall, it's about 50% to 60% that are receiving a concession. And we're averaging right around that 1.5 months or six weeks. But if you go to the downtown San Francisco, you're closer to about 70% to 75% of all the applications receiving two months. Everywhere else is sitting kind of right at that six week or right around that one month mark. And I think what you should expect to see as I said in the prepared remarks, as we see some stability in occupancy see this improvement in demand or demand just holding steady, we'll start dialing back some of the concessions as we work our way through the year.  As far as coming upon the renewal side of the equation a year from now, when we underwrite applicants today, we underwrite them at their gross rent regardless of the concession. So our rent as a percent of income really has not changed in the portfolio from the applications. So we're still running between the low 17% in Seattle and the high at 22.5% in San Diego. And you look at those ratios and you would say they are going to be in a position to afford an increase. They're clearly going to be in a position to afford, continuing to write the check at the rent that the writing regardless of the concession they receive when they moved in with us. So I think that's how we're thinking about a year from now. Well, I think the extent of concession use is greater right now in the portfolio than it's ever been. So I don't know if we can look to the past down cycles and see what does that look like. I'll tell you a lot is going to depend on what the pace of the recovery is like. What do the cities feel like? What are these long-term work-from-home policies going to look like? That is going to dictate more around our concessions still being used widely in the marketplace.  If they are, we probably are not going to be able to just wipe off any concession on a year-over-year basis. We'll stair-step them back to the rents they're paying, but it's not like they're just going to go away. So a lot's going to depend about what is happening around us in that competitive market set as to how those renewals will be treated through our renewal negotiation process. What I'd say about our positioning is the COVID virus the whole pandemic has just accelerated a bunch of trends. And among those is just the dispersion of high wage job growth outside the coastal centers where they used to be predominant, okay? So we have talked about adding exposure in Denver. We've talked about potentially going into Austin. There's other markets that at the right time we'll talk about with you as well. So I think you can expect that we will spread our capital around a bit more over time because I think those jobs have moved around for a lot of different reasons Jeff. I think some people just want different lifestyle. Some folks are looking to get away from maybe some, sort of, tax or political thing that they're concerned about. But I would say for the most part, our residents when you look at where affluent we think renters and the knowledge industries are -- San Francisco still has a lot of advantages as a technology center. New York still has a lot of advantages as both the technology and financial services center. Boston and the biotech in Cambridge and biotech and financial services. So -- but there are other markets that are of interest. So I would say in terms of our positioning right now I'd tell you I think we will continue as we've said I think since 2018 to add exposure in dense suburban areas where we can find affluent renters. And we'll follow our affluent renters to places like Austin and to Denver and we'll continue doing that. So you should expect that we'll continue to broaden the platform out and continue to react to that and react to things like political risk in some of our markets. But there's no risk-free apartment market. Some of the markets that you might move into have had in the past very significant supply issues don't have as big a base of high wage apartment renters. So there's -- again there's a balancing act as you enter each of these markets. Thank you. Yes. So, I guess, I'll give you just a little bit of color on -- I think, I said in the prepared remarks we're definitely seeing an increase in those that are leaving the market. So we used to have about 70% -- or used to be 50%. Now it's about 70%. And New Jersey, Connecticut and California are the top three states where those that do leave are going to with suburban New Jersey is where the majority of them were going. The -- anecdotally from our doorman, from the concierge in the building are -- regardless of the demographic, whether it's young and going back with mom and dad, whether it's the older a lot of them basically are telling the doorman, telling the concierge they will be back. And they will be back as soon as we get to the other side of this pandemic. So to us that's the positive sign that we have that the renter base that we had will return. It's just a matter of when they're going to return. I'm not sure, we have that answer for you right at the top of our fingertips. I mean, CPI is often driven by housing in some of these places. So that is going to be approaching an 8% number under the California rules, which is a one-month concession at least. So I guess I don't -- we don't know the answer to that off the top of our heads. I don't believe so. I think concessions are going to be excluded from that calculation and if you held somebody's rent flat or you actually raised their rent up. But again I'm not 100% positive of that. Well, I think, early on and we talked about this on the last quarter, we saw that the exposure from corporate providers, right, we didn't have a lot to begin with. It was like at 1.5% of the portfolio. We're now down 50%. So we have fewer than 600 units right now with corporate providers. So, I think, one of the early lessons I learned is, yes, we'll probably keep that at a pretty low number throughout the portfolio. I don't think we'll bounce right back. Or if we do, we're going to have really large security deposits on hand from those kind of folks. Operationally, other than that, I think, the biggest thing that this did is, it created a catalyst for us on our sales process. And it has shown us how fast we can move to virtual leasing and how fast we can move to self-guided kind of tours and still be able to produce pretty strong application count. So I think operationally you're seeing us adjust that way to shape the business on the sales side. And we're getting ready to deploy kind of our new sales application this next month that's going to bring mobility to the sales teams and allow us to kind of have multiple assets covered by individuals. So, I think, those are probably the biggest takeaways that I've had on the learnings of these. Yes, it actually ticked down this quarter. So we're just below 11%. We saw like a nominal pickup in the Southern California markets around Orange County and San Diego. But other than that, every market has basically declined about 1 point. So John, do you mean on -- you're breaking up a little. Do you mean rent versus say utility charges or fees, or I'm not sure we follow the question. Okay. Thank you. So, I think I said earlier, we do not change our underwriting criteria at all. So, applicants coming in are run and screened against the growth rent, regardless of concessions. And we really didn't see a material shift in the affordability index, which is rent as a percent of income across any of our markets, where we range still between that 17% and 23%. As far as -- can you give me the last part of that question? No. I mean this is legitimate prospects. I think one of the parts of the question I forgot, which was the closing ratio. So the way to think about kind of, typically you would have foot traffic those that come in for the virtual tour or a self-guided tour, about 25% of the time that converts into an application. And that closing ratio has been fairly consistent. We had a little bit of a change when we got into the initial COVID period, but right now it's fairly stable in our ability to convert kind of that traffic to applications. But really not seeing anything from a quality of the renter or the quality of the applicant showing up for these units. Yeah. Well, I think I shared a little bit of that before, like in New York that we saw an increase of those leaving. So both, New York and San Francisco, probably saw the most pronounced increases of those leaving that MSA but staying nearby, moving to kind of other nearby market, that may have more concentration of suburban-type properties in there. Yeah. So, I guess, I would say -- I think I've said it a couple of times now. In those urban cores, you're absolutely seeing people leave those downtown areas and go to other nearby markets with some upticks like in New York that actually leave the state entirely. So, as you think about the moves intra-city, so are we losing residents that then go to competitors in the market? I guess I will tell you that our renewal process is set up in such a way to handle those negotiations, not only on site but then as soon as somebody does give us a notice, we leverage our national call center to place calls to those residents, just to make sure there is nothing we can do within reason to keep them. And for the most part this is not a rate play. So, I'm sure there are a few that leave us and go somewhere to some concession offer that is just outside of the market boundaries, but a very small percentage of those residents that leave us are doing that to us. The other way to think about it is the increased volume of applications that we're seeing right now, is a pretty good indicator from a market competitive standpoint of our pricing. If we were not competitive, we would not be seeing new leases coming to us. I think what I can give you is just a little bit of backdrop which is, last year this time about 7% in of our applications were coming from those residents outside of the United States. At present, we're down to about 2%, for the third quarter of 2020. So I think changes -- positive changes in the immigration policy that allow us to get back to where we were, would be a catalyst for some of the recoveries in some of those major markets where we're feeling more pressure right now. I guess, I would tell you that it's the major mar -- it is Boston, San Francisco and New York, that you see the biggest changes on this year-over-year basis. Thank you. Yeah. So I guess I'll kind of frame it. So at a total portfolio level, the applications in the third quarter were call it $12,700. And that's compared to $10,700 last year there's definitely seasonality components to those applications. So you will see applications that hit a peak in June or July, call it at 4,000 or 5,000 applications a month. They'll drop down to 2,000 a month or 2,400 a month in November and December. So I would look at this as just the indicator that we are seeing, an extended leasing season. Your point about available inventory is dead on. We need the applications to be running 120%. We actually needed them to be like 125%, in the third quarter just so that we could have held on to the occupancy that we had in the beginning. So A lot of this is just the trade out between if retention starts to improve, we start to renew more residents, then that takes a little bit of pressure off the front door. But if we're going to continue to renew residents call it at 50% 50% of that we will need applications running, 120%, 130%, over prior year."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I will start by thanking my 2,700 Equity Residential colleagues across the country for all they have done this year to take care of our residents and run the business under often trying circumstances. I appreciate your tireless work in meeting the needs of prospects and residents, in an environment that has been constantly changing. Shifting to the business. Our third quarter results reflect the challenges posed by the continuing health crisis and the impact it has had on living and working in the urban centers of our markets. The approximately 23% of our portfolio located in Downtown San Francisco, Manhattan and Brooklyn and Downtown, Boston and Cambridge continue to be the most impacted. When we last spoke with you in late July on our second quarter call, we were seeing demand in excess of 2019 levels and renewals that were at or near 2019 levels, albeit with significant rent reductions and concessions, leading to occupancy being generally stable. As we went through August and early September, we continue to experience good demand, but turnover increased significantly pressuring occupancy. The timing of these turnover increases PAUSE generally with the announcements by employers of delays in bringing employees back to offices, as well as incidence of civil unrest. This occupancy pressure in turn caused further rent declines and increased concessions. So far October has been broadly similar, though we have seen scattered positive signs in the form of modestly improved renewals and higher application volumes. I caution, however, that market conditions remain too volatile and the timing of developments on mitigating the virus too unclear to suggest that we have turned a corner. All that being said, we are heartened by the demand we see for our product, even in urban centers, where life has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. We also see recent office leasing activity by technology firms, as well as activity by financial services office users as a long-term vote of confidence in our urban centers. We believe that the knowledge-based economy will continue to drive growth in the U.S. and that our markets with their massive installed base of universities, innovative companies, venture capital firms, and the many other things that make a knowledge economy grow not to mention renowned entertainment and cultural amenities, will keep them at the center of this activity. The cities in which we do business, and in which many of you live and work, will again be attractive places for affluent long-term renters to live work and play once the pandemic wanes. The impact of the pandemic on increasing the ability of many office workers to remote work is certainly a fascinating new trend, whose long-term impact is difficult to gauge. But no matter what it does to longer-term office demand, we feel that our relatively young demographic craves both work proximity and proximity to the entertainment and cultural amenities in our cities, which we think will remain very attractive to affluent renters once our cities reopen fully. Also, supply in urban centers should in the midterm decline sharply, as developers, lenders and investors react to market conditions and construction costs that have not declined as of yet. While we are not providing earnings guidance, we do want you to be aware that our financial results will weaken over subsequent quarters, as the full impact from the pandemic works its way through our rent roll. Lower lease rates take some time to fully manifest themselves in our reported same-store revenue numbers, because at any one time our rent roll is made up of both new leases with lower rents and leases that were signed at higher rents prior to the beginning of the pandemic. As the composition of our rent roll changes to include more of these lower rate leases our same-store revenue results decline. The opposite is true on our way back up. Occupancy change is causing much quicker shift in the trajectory of our reported revenue numbers. In the meantime, the combination of our portfolio diversity and strong balance sheet will allow us to weather this challenging operating environment. For EQR recovery is a matter of when, not if. A quick note on collections. We continue to have strong results. We are collecting about 97% of our rents and resident payment behavior has not changed. That said, we had increased residential bad debt costs in this quarter, reflecting the fact that although in the aggregate there's only a small number of residents who have stopped paying since the pandemic began. We had a peak in July of those that reached our three-month non-payment threshold and their full balances were written off. From that point forward, only a small number of new non-payers have surfaced, so while we will continue to deal with elevated bad debt and will likely not be to the same extent seen in our third quarter numbers. On a similar note, the write-off of non-residential straight-line rent amounts in the quarter was large and lumpy and should not reoccur going forward. My final comment will be on investment activity. We closed on one acquisition in the quarter 158 unit property in suburban Seattle, and easy commuting distance for the growing job center of Bellevue. The purchase price was $48.9 million. The property is a brand-new asset in lease-up, and we expect a year two cap rate upon completion of the lease-up to be 4.7%. This is the only asset that we have purchased this year versus approximately $750 million in 2020 property sales. And this purchase is a continuation our strategy of buying urban and suburban properties, with affluent well-employed residents, the acquisition of which we believe will lead to attractive long-term cash flow and unlevered IRR growth. We will continue to buy properties using proceeds from selling assets and we think have weaker prospects, due to property condition or location or where the buyer is willing to pay a price that exceeds our estimate of fair value. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer to walk you through the markets in detail and then we'll take your questions. Michael? And just to add Nick it's Mark. We do receive lease termination payments from residents who terminate leases early. So depending on the jurisdiction that could be continuing to pay on your lease or paying us two to three months right then and there as a lease termination cost. So there is the same elevated number, but it isn't like a free option for the resident to exercise. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks John. I guess I'll do a quick survey and just say that if you're in the suburbs and I think this is consistent with you and others have written if you're suburban property owner of a B-property quality asset with a renewal -- or excuse me a renovation potential that probably the asset's worth a little bit more than it was pre pandemic. Class A suburban's probably about the same as it was pre pandemic. The urban stuff in San Francisco and New York would be very hard to trade. I mean, we still see total volume in the third quarter is down 60% for our kinds of assets. And even more so in New York and San Francisco. And I can't even point to completed deals to tell you what the mark is. So I'd say those markets are pretty illiquid. It's I think very logical to assume there's been some reduction in value. My guess is it's going to end up being pretty modest because a lot of folks like us who own in those markets aren't compelled sellers. And because of that you won't see us putting those assets into the market. So I think what you're probably guessing at some modest reduction in value in New York and San Francisco for sure. If we were trying to do a transaction frankly right at this moment I'm not sure how well that would go. I just think people are trying to underwrite declining rents, trying to understand the health crisis, the pandemic coming back again. And I think all of that is -- would make it quite difficult to trade these assets if we needed to do so in some kind of quick haphazard fashion. And of course we don't need to do that. Yes. I think there's two things going on in there and one is a capital allocation thought process that you laid out and there's also in our minds a risk management thought process. I mean, when we start selling assets to buy stock, which we can do that. We don't have that much tax pressure though. At some point, we would and we can't sell an unlimited number of assets and not have gain issues. But as you go through that process of taking EBITDA out of your company, taking NOI out of the company, you're increasing risk. 23% of our NOI right now is under significant pressure.  So switching to a risk management thought process from our perspective, it seems better at this point to be a little more cautious to acknowledge the uncertainty that's out there in the world whether it relates to the pandemic or the values in some of these urban markets and just sit tight and operate the portfolio hard and that's a more prudent thing to do than to go and purchase shares. Because again once that capital leaves the firm, it can't come back.  So again for us just this recycling activity we'll keep doing John because again, it's just relatively minor and we're an apartment company. That's what we do, but buying stock back to us increases risk in the firm and we just think this isn't a point in time when you want to do that. There are other assets that are going to be sold. We're going to sell into this bid as I mentioned for the value bid for some of this Class B renovation stuff in the suburbs. We've got properties where we don't believe in the renovation play where others may. So you should expect we'll sell into that. We may pay down some more debt. That will leave us with options, which could include a buyback at some juncture.  It will definitely include recycling into assets in these dense suburban areas and in other markets, which we've talked about on prior calls. So -- but doing a buyback right now with the pressure we're feeling on operations any uncertainty in the world at large does not seem like the right idea to us. Thank you. It's always easier to look at these problems from the outside. Hey, Rich, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. I guess as we think about it it's pretty predominantly related to the public health emergency. So let's spend a moment together speculating on how that might play out and that's all this is, meaning there is good reason to believe the virus will get worse. I think there's good reason to believe the vaccine will become available, especially the health workers and people that are more at risk over the next few months. And then slowly all the rest of us will get that. So you will head into the spring leasing season maybe with some positive signs on the COVID front. I mean one of the reasons you're hearing a lot of caution from us is we've got this elevated demand, which we like. We've got elevated inventory but we're also heading into the quietest time of the year. So we need to be really thoughtful about our seasonality. So not only are we fighting COVID, we're fighting seasonality. Right now we're bucking the seasonality. We're doing really well on leasing. The team's doing a great job. Rate's still suffering but what we would hope would happen just as you think about headwinds to us the most predominant headwind is COVID. Because on job growth, our resident base from what we can tell didn't lose their jobs. That was \u2013 unfortunately, people in some of these service sectors, in hospitality business, things like that and that is in our resident base. So I think a lot of our residents are well employed. They just don't care to live in some of these urban centers right now when their \u2013 these centers are disengaged and aren't as much fun to live in. And I think that a great number of those folks will come back. And the new crop of people the people that graduated from MBA programs, from technology programs and want that city experience, those folks will still want it, because that younger demographic that we mostly cater to balances safety I think and engagement entertainment differently. And I think Rich, they'll be \u2013 they'll want to come back and they'll be eager to come back if the cities are a reasonable facsimile of what they were before. So that's how we're looking at it. It doesn't mean, we're guaranteeing things are better in the spring but we're saying that the next quarter or so, we're dealing with the seasonal decline in demand as well as whatever the virus brings us. And that makes us a little more concerned. Sure. And the comment in the press release that I made about things rolling through the financials I just want to make sure everyone understands, it isn't necessarily that things will keep getting worse and worse and worse. It's more that whatever is happening in the rent roll now, takes a quarter or so to manifest itself in reported numbers. So what will happen first is on some call in the future in some press release, Michael Manelis will tell you things have started to get better. Occupancy is firmed up. Concessions are declining. Maybe rate isn't moving yet but that famed second derivative is going in the right direction. So you'll see it in what I call the management accounting numbers before you see it in the numbers that Bob reports to you for same store revenues. So that's what we're trying. Because again we've got a pretty new group of analysts frankly on these calls. A lot of investors aren't as familiar. It's been a while since we've had a downturn. So we're just trying to make sure everyone understands how that works in the apartment business. Well, there's one thing you said I want to latch on to. You said the interest of PE firms. And generally, the private folks with investment dollars are very interested in the apartment sector. And you use the word stable. I would say half our business is pretty stable. A third of it in the urban centers outside New York, Boston, San Francisco is okay, but marginally weakening and then a quarter of our business is having a tough run of it. So I'd say that when you think about the buyback, like I said in some of the prior responses and when you think about any other action or interest from PE firms, there's going to be a lot of interest in the New York portfolio at the moment. That portfolio needs to find a floor on rents. It needs to have some enthusiasm and excitement in the urban center again and people moving back in. Then you'll get a floor under that. In terms of taking a company this size private I mean that's obviously a matter for the Board to consider, not for me alone to determine, but I think it's way too early to start thinking about things like that. And I would expect that at some point again when the operations of the company, especially in the urban centers feel a little more stable, we'll feel like a larger menu of capital allocation options are open to us. At that point, there'll be conversations with the Board about things like buybacks again, and other conversations. For now, I think the best thing to do is to run the portfolio hard and stay super flexible. And that's the right thing to do. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. So, I think, it's going it's a little bit of a laggard, right? So -- on the property tax side. So right now, we're kind of beginning or prepping for the -- I'll call it hand-to-hand combat or conversations with every local jurisdiction, but it tends to run kind of on a lagging basis. You probably won't see anything or any kind of relief at least until 2021 or maybe even into 2022 based on prior experience. It's going to be that argument or that conversation about what jurisdictions are doing on the rate side relative to what they're doing on the assessment side. We're very used to this. We've done it for years and we will have those conversations. So far we haven't seen much activity, but it's really just the nature of when -- when the actual assessments or new rates and all that comes out depending on the jurisdiction. Yes. It's a little anecdotal for us, because though we've owned for a while in New York, we really didn't own right then. So what we know about what happened then is mostly from, frankly, our people who did work at other apartment companies or all our contacts that lived in the market. I mean, again, New York, you said it very well. The difference in population is significant. I mean, by 2016, the city was considerably more populated. And I think it might have had the highest population it ever had compared to 2001. And the obituary was clearly written on New York then. The city, Michael and I would summarize it from being there and from our conversations, talking -- New York is definitely trying to get up off the mat. If some progress can continue to hold on the virus, people want to go back. There's a special feeling to the city. People are there. There's a lot of interest. Our volume in New York is higher proportionately than anywhere else. It's just the rate is low. We just need even more demand to make up for folks that have made the decision, Rich, to move temporarily to New Jersey or whatnot and come back. So I'm probably a little less concerned with New York than I am with San Francisco, where a combination of work from home and just quality-of-life concerns and just the sort of general feeling around that -- those 10 properties we have in the city of San Francisco, that feels probably a little more concerning to me in the medium term. I think, again, as long as the pandemic by the spring starts to wane and we have it under control, I think, people want to be back in New York. And that will happen. In San Francisco, I just think it might take longer frankly. Hey, thanks, Rich. So we have significant engagement through our trade associations on all sorts of things. I don't recall being specifically engages related to reopening restaurants. We're certainly big supporters of the idea that the partnership for New York put out in their letter of getting the cities running again and being on top of everything from sanitation to just all the transit all the things that make cities fun and livable. So, I guess, our answer to that is, we're not involved day-to-day in that, but the trade associations we support are involved in those things. And we support the bigger groups of citizens and leaders and companies that are pushing for being a little more balanced here and for political leaders to take into account these business interests. The majority of it -- I guess, the majority of the 2% growth, really, all of it is uncollected rent. I mean, whether that's your monthly rent or your utility reimbursement, whatever the charge is to the resident, that's the uncollected amount that's in there. Yes. And I just would add, I mean there's some percentage of our residents who did lose their jobs, did have situations like Bob mentioned. They could be gig workers in the content industry in L.A. There's also public policy reasons. Some people aren't paying, because they feel like they don't have to. And we continue to pursue those folks. And within the bounds of the law, we'll be relentless in that matter. I mean, there's a contractual obligation here, but we also want to work with people. I mean, if there's some understanding that they need from us, they need some more time, we've got a good number of payment plans out there. So you made your comment. I think you're right. There's some folks where that government supplement mattered. That didn't matter as much to us, but there was a few employees -- or a few people excuse me residents of ours that did lose their jobs and that's certainly in the number that we wrote off in the quarter. But there is some of that that's likely behavior-driven and that's something that will work itself out over the next whatever number of quarters. So we're fortunate with these eviction moratoriums instead high-quality resident base where again our people are getting great service. I mean, I read all these comments Haendel and it's really awesome that we get from the people that work for Michael and on site. And it's folks that interact with our service personnel, our customers, our residents, interact with our concierge, with our on-site staff. And they say, terrific things. So a lot of our people they don't hate their landlord. They like their experience with us. They think we're doing a good job. They appreciate how hard we work during the pandemic to keep them safe. So the good news for us is, most of our residents pay and that's not a problem. In terms of these eviction moratorium which have been tough on a lot of more affordable landlords I think the right answer is, what the industry has been pushing National Multi Housing Council and others which is the proposal, the idea of putting more cash in the pockets of renters so they can pay their rent. The idea of putting this loss entirely on landlords and breaking the residential housing system in the United States is just a terrible idea in the long run. And I think the answer is, if the need is great then we as taxpayers have to shoulder that burden. Congress needs to appropriate the money. President needs to sign the law and the money needs to go either directly to landlords or to residents who are in need so they can make their payments. So landlords in turn -- I mean EQR for example our biggest single expense is $400 million a year in property taxes. That in turn support all the first responders, in these hard-pressed municipalities and stuff and as well as our significant payroll costs and keeping our properties up. So I guess Haendel, it's about having that conversation with people and explaining the whole, I've heard it called connected ecosystem here. I mean so -- but again for EQR it hasn't been quite as big an issue yet, but I think in the long run these eviction moratoriums are pretty awful idea. And I think they become less and less justifiable as time goes on. Wow. A lot in that question. I'm hesitant to give you guidance. I mean we don't have any formal guidance. And I'm hesitant to suggest any particular quarter for things changing on the NOI front. It doesn't mean that we have pessimism. It's just impossible with the public health emergency to predict. But I will tease this color out. Again on the rate side it, takes a while for it to go negative and a while for it to go positive. And that's what we've been talking about. The little offhand comment we made was on occupancy. Right now we have buildings that are occupied in the high 80s that are very desirable buildings. And when New York becomes New York again and people move back, that improvement in occupancy will be immediate. And that will go to the top line immediately and to the NOI number you referred to. So rate takes a while both up and down. This was quick because there was so much pressure. On the way up, you should expect it will take a while on rates to get rid of the concessions start moving rate. That will take a little while, but the occupancy boost will feel more immediate. And unfortunately I mean this portfolio was running 97%. Right now this morning we're 89.9%. So right at 90% as Michael said. You could make up 7 points in occupancy, if the city became the city again pretty quick. And again, I'm not predicting when that occurs, but I think there's an occupancy opportunity for us but which quarter it all occurs just depends on when the virus gets better. And I want to add, Alex. People, who are applying for us, are putting down a deposit and paying a fee. So when they're involved with us, it isn't -- you make it sound like it's a little bit of a bid. I mean at that point, we've sort of agreed on price with them, subject to a credit and criminal background check review. And they move -- the great preponderance of those people end up moving in with us. So applications for us, just so you understand, are a forward indicator of move-ins. This month's applications are next month's move-ins, and are -- that month's reduction in left to lease and that next month's increase in occupancy. Maybe that helps you. So the quality -- and we do qualify people based on the rent without the concession, just to be really clear about that. So they can afford to pay the face rent, not just the rent, reduced on some effective basis by the concession. Yeah, there were some -- it's Mark. There were some discussion Alex, we've heard from our people in Southern California, both hospitality plays, strip centers in the Los Angeles area strip retail, of which there's a fair amount that might go residential. So there is some conversation, and I've heard about it, particularly in Southern California as to both hospitality and retail. There's other spots we've been involved with shopping center owners, and thinking about repurposing out lots and things like that. So there's a fair bit of conversation on that. But, again most recently, I've heard a fair bit about it in Southern Cal. Thank you. Hey, Alex, it's Mark. We're going to split that up. I'm going to ask Bob to talk about capital markets and the debt maturity, we got coming next year that's at pretty high rate. He can go through in a second. On our end, you're going to see that in the quarter at least G&A and property management, our overhead categories collectively were down, I think, it was 10% or 15%. You should expect that to continue. I mean, we're certainly responsive to the fact that cash flow's going down and overhead needs to follow that. So, there'll continue to be adjustments in that regard. I don't feel like we have a lot of folks that aren't being well utilized. I think it's just a matter of what is going to be sort of bonus compensation, those sorts of things. That's where the discussions lie. And then just running the business more efficiently, Michael talked earlier about he did in terms of remote leasing. That certainly has impacts on headcount. So things like that. So you should expect that we will be just as relentless. I'm not -- again, I don't feel like we have a lot of people sitting around on their hands, but I do think we need to be responsive to the fact that NOIs are going down and overhead needs to respond to that. And you can see in the third quarter, it did and you should expect it will continue to. So, Alex, we believe in the sanctity of contract both ways. And so these people we don't have the ability to evict them. So, there are some number of people that can pay that haven't. We'll continue to monitor that situation. Again, we're always willing to -- some people haven't even communicated with us. We talked about ghosting on the last call and had a little fun with that, but we've got to have these conversations with people figure out how we can help them, how they can meet their contractual obligation to pay rent and how we can move forward. There is no rent forgiveness program at Equity Residential. Thanks a lot, Alex. Sure. So again, I don't understand all the back and forth on the tax side with our peer. But I would say that most joint venture transactions when you're keeping the cash. And you're the 40-plus percent seller, which does create gain, unless you do a lot of structuring things that create other risks. So doing a JV is great to prove value to create diversification to get new capital and all those other things. But in terms of it being a great way to sell an asset it isn't a whole lot different than just selling it out, right. So I guess I'd say on the tax side, I look at the JV and I look at an asset sale relatively similarly. Now if a JV partner, an institutional investor wanted to be in with us in a market. And they would provide a better price and better terms on the portion they were purchasing, because they are differently correlated than just the straight up buyers, we'd be interested in that we're open minded. We have very few JVs, but we've done many in the past. And so, I guess, I'd say, Michael, we're open to doing some JVs at some of our assets and maybe some of our urban assets if the price made sense to us. But it -- getting cash out and buying stock back just to use the most obvious example, is a pretty hard thing to do at least in great size, without triggering some kind of special dividend requirement or really stressing your tax situation. Every company has got its own goals and motives, but the way I've been taught for years is to not pay taxes earlier, than you need to. And so there isn't a great deal of desire on the part of our Board to create a taxable event, just so that the company has more flexibility in selling assets. So if we need that flexibility, we can manage that at the time. And we did do a special dividend before. And that's because giving capital back to the shareholders, in that case made so much sense. So I guess I'd rather address that on an as-needed basis, rather than do it in some parameter fashion. Well, we thank you for the interest in Equity Residential for sticking with us on a long call. And we wish everyone well. Thanks."

            "name": "Bob Garechana",
            "content": "So I'd say that it's geographically focused, right? So some -- the bad debt is running higher in places like Los Angeles, which was before the pandemic, the area where you probably had the highest or the most constrained kind of rent to income levels. So you may have had probably centers or pockets, where you had a little bit more gig economy stuff. So some people have lost their jobs. We're talking about a pretty small population base in the aggregate of call it 1,100 folks that are in that bad debt piece anyways. So it's -- there is some job loss, right, but for the most part to Mark's earlier point, we think our general demographic isn't really driving it. And I'll tell you, it's been really consistent and hasn't changed much. Mark said in his prepared remarks, we had this pocket of how our policy works. But if you look at individual accounts like you've had the same accounts, they hit the 3x. They kind of peaked in July. And since then, we haven't really added very much at all to that non-payer bucket. It's actually the same kind of existing group that has just continued not to pay that is there at 9/30. Sure. So we remain reasonably confident on defeating Prop 21. I think the industry is well organized. Barry Altshuler, who's one of our senior investment guys is the President of the California Apartment Association with other industry leaders. He's just led a really great campaign to educate people in California. That Prop 21 doesn't create a single unit new unit of affordable housing. It doesn't put anyone who's homeless into a home. All it does is discourage investment in our markets in housing. So I think what we feel as we've made a good case. Things have changed in terms of the way the vote will be tabulated. I mean it's all remote. It wouldn't surprise us if it continued past the actual election day as maybe more than one election will in the U.S., but we feel pretty good about it. There was a good poll in one of the Southern California papers on this as well. So at this moment, we're feeling reasonably confident, but it's a presidential election year. A lot more people will be voting than voted in 2018 and we'll keep making our case to the people in the state of California all the way through November 3. And in terms of vote places, yes there's not a lot. There's a ballot measure in Colorado that would raise property taxes for residential both homeownership and apartment owners and stuff like that, but it's just not nearly as significant as Prop 21. So that's where for us at least most of the action is. Sure. Well we'll do a quick survey. So Washington state, they're obviously they're going to have their legislative election. There's been some discussion there about California-tyle rent control, meaning a CPI plus and inclusive of vacancy decontrol. The industry continues to talk about that with them. There's some real downsides to part of that approach, but we're engaging in that conversation. As you go across a little less pressure in Massachusetts, certainly New York has its own set of elections in a week and we'll see what that ends up being. But I would imagine there's always things to talk about in New York, but there isn't anything on the hopper. And as I understand, it the general assembly isn't in session. So we don't need to worry about that at the moment. Washington D.C. city council is considering various rent control measures, a few of which are highly negative. We don't think those are likely to go through. We're having constructive conversations there through our trade association. So there's always things that we're looking into Rob and we're always out there supporting. And we have a pretty active engagement with policymakers and when it's a ballot proposal with the whole electorate on this stuff. And usually, once you have the conversations, you and explain what's really going to happen here the emotional satisfaction of rent control, usually fades away because it doesn't work. I mean universally academics tell you it doesn't work and the market experience shows it doesn't work. And we try and talk about ways to improve zoning, to create private incentives, so that people are out there building more affordable. So that's really the battle. Thank you. Yes. So because that also depends on who controls the Senate and whether the House stays where it is now and -- but it's really hard to speculate on. I mean I think it's pretty well understood the programs people have. I mean some of the things you didn't mention for example, more certainty on immigration and more positive immigration policies would be helpful to us. More regulation would generally not be positive for us. Some things like taxes changing may create more or less economic growth. So it's hard for me to say that, EQR is a particular dog in this fight and I'm hesitant to get involved in any of that. So -- but I do think the mortgage tax thing it wasn't a big impact on us before when they took it away, so I doubt it will matter very much here to us at all. I think a stimulus package to me, I think after the election's done, I would guess there's a pretty high chance that that will get done because once the election's done given how frail the stock market and the economy feel, I think the politicians will look at each other and go, okay we need to do this now and there's not as much risk to the election is over and there's no benefit to be gained from waiting. So I guess, I'm sort of expecting some stimulus to happen after the election. That seems like the bedding line out there regardless of who wins. Thank you. Just a credit quality question. And on the balance sheet side, Alex as you think about it, you've got the big maturity the $750 million maturity in 2021. That does carry a 4.625% coupon, and we could refinance that today on a 10-year basis at call it 2%. So there is still a positive arbitrage between the refinancing activity going forward. So that exists frankly if you look at our maturity schedule on Page 2018 not just in 2021, but continue in 2022 based on where -- and 2023, despite the fact that we don't have a ton of debt maturing. Yeah, I don't think we're just going to wait for the markets to come back. I think political risk has changed in our markets. I think when we thought about this shift into urban 15 years ago. One of the reasons we liked the urban centers was it was politically difficult to build, that the politics created a supply constraint that we like. So to be honest some of the markets were chosen with some of that in mind, Alex. And then as time has gone on, I would say what's happened is that there's this bit of a bias against landlords. There's a bit of a regulatory mindset that is challenging to work through and we do think political risk is higher in our markets. And one of the reasons to spread our capital out both in the suburbs of our markets, because a lot of rent control and rent regulation is local, okay? Some of it is at the state level, but a lot of it is local. So you might want to be in a metro, but you may not be want to be exactly where you were in the center before. So you should expect we'll continue responding to that risk by spreading out and also going into some metros where the supply risk may actually be worse in some of those other metros we're not in, but you're getting some compensating political risk benefits. I'll also say that you didn't mention it quite as much, but the fiscal situation is quite concerning in some of our markets by the way also in some markets we're not in, okay? So, there's plenty of municipalities under a lot of stress. That's another thing we keep in mind. So, whenever we buy an asset, we underwrite or develop an asset. Two, we underwrite the locality, the county, the state and how it looks from a financial perspective and think about as a land -- long-term owner of this property whether that's a risk we're willing to take. So, I think we're pretty focused on managing our existing political risk by having like, again, this big outreach to politicians and to policymakers we talked about and then secondarily just over time shifting some of our capital to places that maybe are a little friendlier in that regard. Yeah. That's a great point about we'll continue to try in our materials for NAREIT to continue to elaborate on that, because the virtuous cycle for us the beginning of improvement begins with retention improving and with applications holding. They don't have to go up from here and likely won't just given seasonally where we are, but continuing to outperform on applications which again a month later are move-ins and doing better on renewals especially in these urban markets. That will start solidifying occupancy. That will start giving Michael confidence to start removing concessions. So we absolutely will try and be as clear as we can about, historical trends. And you've been around a long time. So this gets confused with you've got this cycle win this economic cycle on top of just our seasonal cycle. So you have two things going on. We may tell you in December that, applications went down but they're still three times what they normally are in December, right? But they're less than November. So we'll try and do a good job of being clear on those things. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please, go ahead.\nMarty McKenna: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's second quarter 2020 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. During one of the most challenging periods in our country and industry's history, we feel that our business showed considerable resiliency. We continue to be pleased with the financial strength of our customer base, with our average annual household incomes of $164,000. Data suggests that only 4% of workers, making more than $150,000 a year, have recently lost their jobs compared to the low-teens for lower income categories. We have collected about 97% of our residential rents during the second quarter and attribute this to a customer base that remains well-employed and capable of meeting their obligations. July is trending similarly. We also demonstrated strong expense results, while the pandemic both added and subtracted costs from our operations, the innovations around leasing and service that we described in prior calls have really taken hold and we expect a durable reduction in our expense growth rate even after COVID is in the rear view mirror. And while our 90 basis point decline in same store residential revenue was our first quarterly revenue decline in 10 years, our residential business held up reasonably well under very trying circumstances. We also believe that we have stabilized our physical occupancy at 95%. In a moment, Michael will give you some color on what is going on in each of our markets and Bob will address our expenses, non-residential operations and balance sheet. And then, we will welcome your questions. But before I turn it over, I want to highlight a couple of things. First, in the quarter, we stabilized two development properties, one in Cambridge, Massachusetts and another in Seattle, Washington. The Cambridge asset is a 64-unit property, adjacent to an existing asset of ours and was built for $47 million and stabilize at approximately 5% yield on cost. This property complements our large existing Cambridge portfolio of six properties with about a 1,100 units and is ideally suited to house the biotech employees working in that area. The other property consists of 137 units and is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle and cost $65 million to build. It stabilized at about a 5% yield on cost. In terms of transactions, we're pleased to close on two dispositions during the quarter and have sold more than $750 million in assets during 2020. We feel that we received strong pricing on this quarter sales, as both sold assets were over 50 years old and our combined disposition yield was 4.4%. But we note that these sales were priced prior to the pandemic and so shouldn't be seen as a look through on current pricing. We have not acquired anything this year, but we like to think of ourselves as professional opportunists and have a balance sheet that as strong as it has ever been, which will allow us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. And now a bit about our capital allocation strategy. We have spoken on prior calls about the company broadening its portfolio by expanding into Denver and into the dense suburbs of our markets. For the last few years, we've been actively pruning our exposure in some urban locations, including Manhattan, and buying more dense suburban assets. Our current portfolio mix stands at about 55% urban and 45% suburban. We will continue to build and buy apartments in locations, both urban and dense suburban, where affluent renters wish to live and in markets where we feel long-term returns will be maximized. We believe that our strategy is sufficiently flexible to retain high-quality urban properties, while adding some breath of the portfolio over time, so we can continue to produce a reliable and growing stream of income for our shareholders. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark. Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees during the second quarter. Despite very challenging operating conditions, the team was able to focus on the health and safety of their fellow employees and our residents by implementing our new operating standards to address COVID concerns. These heightened cleanliness standards have been well received by residents and prospects. The team elevated their voices in various listening sessions held throughout our organization to share how they were navigating and managing stress due to the unrest in our country. Their voices will help us continue to cultivate a culture of inclusion at Equity Residential. They stayed on top of delinquency by executing a consistent and transparent process that emphasize frequent communication with residents who are financially impacted by the virus. Our collection rate remained strong and fairly stable throughout the quarter, with a little over 97% being collected. They focused on retaining existing residents, as evidenced by turnover at 11.8% for the quarter, which is a 130 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019. This was driven by a 10% reduction in move-outs during the quarter, as more residents opted to stay in place. Achieved renewal rate increases were positive 70 basis points for the quarter, but we expect this number to trend lower as negotiations become more challenging. Right now about 20% of our renewal offers for July and August include a slight market rate increase. The team also adopted new technologies for both sales and service that allowed us to meet the needs of our customers while creating operating efficiencies, which contributed to the low growth in our operating expenses. As to occupancy, we stated on the last call that we expected the occupancy impact to be the most pronounced in the second quarter, setting a new base from which we've hoped we would improve as shelter-in-place orders were lifted that so far appears to be the case. The portfolio was 95% occupied today and we average 94.9% through the quarter after recovering from a 94.2% low point in mid-May. On the rate side, since last week in May, base rents have been relatively stable, but this is bit of a bifurcated story. Pricing remains challenged in the urban cores of New York the city of Boston and Downtown San Francisco, which represents about one quarter of our portfolio. The rest of the portfolio is showing more price stability. The rents are still lower than last year. New lease change was down 7% this quarter for our same-store portfolio, before concessions. New lease concessions during the quarter, were heavily concentrated in the urban cores of New York, San Francisco and Boston. Factoring in concessions, the net effective new lease change for the portfolio during the quarter was down 9%. Overall traffic and application activity improved throughout the quarter as net effective prices were being lowered. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, application activity was recovering at the end of April and continued to do so through the remainder of the quarter. By late May and into June, we are seeing somewhat higher new applications week-over-week relative to the same periods in 2019. This improvement, however, was not sufficient to make up for the nearly 40% year-over-year reduction experienced in April. As a result, the total number of move-ins for the second quarter, were 20% below the second quarter of 2019. At present, we think it is helpful to split our portfolio into three pieces as we think about our forward operating performance. First, our suburban assets, which represents approximately 45% of the company's portfolio, have been more resilient during the pandemic with occupancy declining to a low point of 95.2% before recovering fully to levels at or above prior year and ending the quarter at t 96.6%. Suburban renewal percent was very strong at 65% and continues to trend well above prior year. Rates have been slowly recovering since early May, and there have been very limited concessions used in this portfolio. Second, our urban assets that are located in the city of Boston and Cambridge, Manhattan and Brooklyn and Downtown San Francisco, which represents about 25% of the company's portfolio and is currently 91% occupied. As stated earlier, this portfolio has the highest use of concessions and the most rate pressure. For the quarter, this urban portfolio renewed 58% of residents, which is 500 basis points lower than Q2 of 2019 and was trending down throughout the quarter ending at 53% in June. The urban cores in Boston, New York and San Francisco have the highest risk of volatility in operations for the balance of the year. Our third grouping, consist of urban assets and other markets like Washington D.C., Seattle and Southern California and consist of about 30% of our portfolio. These assets reached the low point in occupancy of 94% in mid-May, but quickly bounce back and remained at 95.2%. Pricing has been stable since the middle of May, with rates being down year-over-year and concessions being used on about 15% of our applications. During the quarter, 57% of residents renewed from these assets, which is 300 basis points better than the second quarter of 2019. Overall, this group of urban assets has had consistent operations for the past two months with a slight uptick in occupancy in the past couple of weeks. Let me provide some quick color on the markets. Starting with Boston, the urban center of Boston and Cambridge represent about three quarters of our total Boston portfolio and were more impacted by early termination in non-renewals from international students and third party corporate providers, while neither one of these represent a significant amount of total units, the impact was concentrated. The Boston urban center is now 91.5% occupied and continues to be pressured on rates and occupancy, especially given the uncertainty around international students and the competitive supply being delivered. The other submarkets in Boston have been operating at 95%, with consistent rates and very little concession use. Overall, applications have been running at or above prior year for the entire market as we see good demand for our product. We continue to like this market long-term due to its combination of bio, education and technology jobs and the high quality of lifestyle. Washington D.C. continues to demonstrate some resilience, although the market has not escape pricing pressure. Absorption of new supply continues, and the use of concessions, remain extremely limited in our portfolio. Applications have been running at prior year levels and the portfolio is 95.8% occupied. Moving on to New York, which continues to be one of our most challenging markets. Leasing traffic and application volume returned to 2019 levels by mid-May, but at reduced rental rates and higher levels of concessions. The leasing traffic in the city is heavily centered around local bargain hunters who are moving within the market and searching for a deal. Concession use is widespread with about 50% of our applications receiving concessions, which now average greater than one month. While the application count has recovered to prior year levels this was not enough to make up for the deficit created by the lack of volume in April. Retention started strong in the quarter but has since moderated. During June we renewed 57% of our renewal offered, which is strong by all accounts but lower than June of 2019. Our assets on the Hudson Waterfront, New Jersey, which is about a quarter of our New York exposure have performed better than Manhattan and Brooklyn. We have held 95% occupancy on the Waterfront for the past month and while concessions are being used, it's at a lower level than in Manhattan. Our New York same-store portfolio including New Jersey is about 92% occupied today. Recovery in Manhattan and Brooklyn will take some time but if office re-openings begin in early 2021 as currently expected and the city continues to show good progress on controlling the virus, we may see higher than usual demand later this year and early next year during a period when demand is typically seasonally soft. Heading over to the West Coast, Seattle delivered the strongest revenue results in the quarter both in terms of absolute revenue growth and the combined impact of new lease change and renewals. The portfolio is 95.3% occupied today and overall revenue performance has been very consistent since early April, although pricing decelerated slightly through what normally is the growth period of peak leasing season. We have not seen big layoffs in tech jobs in the market, but we are keeping an eye on employers like Amazon, who last week announced that they were extending their corporate office employees working from home until early January and have delayed new hire start dates from August into September, October. Overall, this trend may cause some short-term pressure on demand and occupancy, but could also provide a boost to the fourth quarter, which typically slows down. San Francisco's revenue performance is very different depending on the submarket, most notably between urban and suburban. Our portfolio in this market is approximately 30% urban and 70% suburban. In the city of San Francisco, we are seeing declining rents that are presently well into the double-digits year-over-year and represents the largest year-over-year decline in our entire portfolio. The city also has widespread concession use at/or above four weeks and has experienced the biggest impact from start-up layoffs and the lack of foreign immigration. Our suburban portfolio located in the Peninsula South Bay and East Bay, as well as the few urban assets that we have in those submarkets stabilized in early May. While rates are down on a year-over-year basis here, they have been holding in place for over a month with very limited use of concessions. The South Bay is still at risk as new supply enters that submarket at a time when the large tech companies have slowed growth and are trying to figure out longer term work-from-home policies. That said the San Francisco Bay Area remains a great place to live, tech companies remain a strong high wage job growth engine and the long-term outlook remains positive. Heading to Southern California, overall pricing is down in L.A. but very stable through June with very little concession used in our portfolio. L.A. is 96.1% occupied today West L.A. remains the most challenged submarket, but even here occupancy recovered to 94.1% and the Downtown submarket, which currently has supply pressure has been stable at 95%, although rent declines are the most pronounced in this submarket. Overall, we are seeing strength in the suburban submarkets of L.A., which is about 45% of our L.A. portfolio. This strength is mitigating the rate and occupancy declines in Downtown, Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire in West LA. While the high levels of competitive supply being delivered in the second half of the year, recent spike in COVID cases and the reversal a phased opening plans for the market are certainly potential short-term negatives. But content creation and technology job story in this large diverse market remains positive. We think jobs in L.A. have the potential to grow even more strongly coming out of the pandemic in order to meet the increasing demand for new online content. Finally, Orange County and San Diego are both performing well with occupancy above prior year and very limited downward pressure on rates. These are beyond challenging times, but our business is demonstrating resilience and our teams have shown that they can deliver. At this point, I will turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Garechana: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today I will make a couple of brief remarks on same-store expenses, delinquency and bad debt, and conclude with the balance sheet. Same-store expenses declined for the quarter relative to prior year, driven by the advancements in our technology initiatives that Michael mentioned and delay or deferral of certain expenses largely stemming from the pandemic. Page 16 of the release provides detailed color on specific line items. I do want to highlight that expenses in the quarter included approximately $1 million related to one-time bonuses for our frontline workers and another $500,000 from elevated cleaning and other health and safety costs. As evidenced by our strong 97% collection rate for the quarter, our high-quality resident continues to pay their rent. That said, the combination of the small percentage of our residents that have been financially impacted by the pandemic and our conservative accounting policy has led to elevated residential bad debt in the quarter. Residential bad debt reduced revenue growth by approximately $9 million or 150 basis points in the same-store portfolio. That is about 100 basis points higher than the comparable period in 2019, which would have been a more typical level. For the next quarter or so, economic and regulatory uncertainties may lead to continued elevated bad debt. Turning to our non-residential business. I would remind you that the non-residential business is a small part of our overall operations at approximately 4% of revenues historically. But it is likely to have a disproportionate impact on total same store performance for the next few quarters. Retail tenant collections were about 60% for the quarter with collections trending slightly higher in June. Uncollected amounts that were deferred were almost entirely reserved against during the quarter from the financial statement standpoint. About two-thirds of the decline in non-residential revenues quarter-over-quarter stemmed from these reserves and other bad debt related items. Much like in residential, we have applied a relatively conservative accounting policy. This business is likely to continue to face challenges and we expect that the third quarter could be even tougher given likely delays in reopening activity and the potential lack of additional government small business stimulus. If retail performance continues to be stressed, we expect that a significant portion of the straight line non-residential receivable disclosed on page 11 could be at risk and therefore could be written-off. Finally a quick highlight on our fortress-like balance sheet. We enter the pandemic from a position of strength and have further enhanced our position through thoughtful refinancing activity and incremental debt reduction from disposition proceeds. By taking these steps, we have ensured sufficient liquidity and incremental debt capacity for any opportunities that may present themselves. We have limited near-term maturities, modest development spend and incredible access to capital. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Bob. And a final note while we fully acknowledge that the next few quarters will be difficult, the cities in which we operate have shown great resilience over time and while some of them are certainly challenged today, we believe that they will bounce back when we reach the other side of this pandemic. We expect that these cities will remain at the center of the knowledge-based economy and will continue to attract high income renters. We think that the obituaries for the great urban centers have been written much too prematurely. The world's great cities have continued to adapt and thrive over time and they will do so again. We appreciate the continued support we have received from the investment community as we navigate the current storms and look forward to coming out of this pandemic well-positioned for long-term growth. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today and that is from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.\nRich Hightower: Hey, good morning, guys. Hope everybody is doing well.\nMichael Manelis: Morning.\nMark Parrell: Morning.\nRich Hightower: So a lot of ground we could cover on this, but I'll try to limited to a couple of questions here. So thanks for taking the questions. But just to go back to the topic of renewal rents for a second. So I wanted to back up to one of Michael's comments, I guess 20% of renewals for July and August you said included a slight increase. Does that imply that 80% roughly are flat to negative? And then are you, sort of, seeing increasingly bold asks among your tenants on the renewal side specifically given that it's probably a pretty well informed tenant base?\nMichael Manelis: Yeah. Hey, Rich. This is Michael. So I guess, I would start and say really for the past couple of months the performance in renewals has been relatively consistent. So the comment about 20% having in increase that's the quotes going out the door. And you need to remember we're still subject to a lot of various rent freezes in place. So you are correct 80% of our offers that went out for July and August include no increase. The negotiation process has been very consistent. We're kind of quoting about a one and we're achieving about a negative one. So about a 200 basis point spread on that performance.\nRich Hightower: And that negative one that's inclusive of any concessions just to clarify that.\nMichael Manelis: Yeah. So we're not doing a lot of renewal concessions or we haven't been in the portfolio. I think we've seen a handful in the quarter in New York but it's very insignificant dollar amounts.\nRich Hightower: Okay. That is helpful. And then just a quick one on capital allocation. Mark I know that you said in your prepared comments that the pricing that was achieved on the dispositions in 2Q is not really reflective of I guess private market reality today. But where do you see that spread between private market today and EQR's implied trading cap rate and then where the share repurchases potentially fit into the capital allocation strategy?\nMark Parrell: Wow Rich that's a compound question. Thank you for that. So we'll start by just talking -- That's all right I will just talk about values and we'll start with the private market. I mean in the quarter, there just hasn't been that much activity. We think activity in our markets for our kinds of assets meaning assets with over 50 units that are of our type of quality, we're probably down 70% in the second quarter. So what I'm about to tell you is based on pretty limited volume. But it seems to us that the private market values have held in there. So we've seen a few deals trade in Downtown Seattle stuff in North side of the suburban Denver, Complex in Washington D.C. and the Virginia side then a couple of these New York deals that we've been watching, but they haven't closed. Those are all trading at values that indicate to us that the pandemic has not taken private market values down or not taken them down very much at all. But again, very small sample sizes in fairness. And then you asked about share repurchases. Well certainly the company rarely trades at this significant a discount to NAV. I mean this is very unusual for us. I'm not at all dismissive of share buybacks I would just tell you that you start as a REIT with the inability to retain earnings. So -- and you start also with the ability to return capital through a pretty large dividend. Our annual dividend is $900 million of capital returned to shareholders every year. So I'd say to you that we're open to it, we have a $13 million share allocation on the share buyback side, that's a conversation we'll continue between the Board and myself and we'll think more on that. But I will say this is pretty unprecedented for us to trade at this discount. And I think again as far as I can tell private market value changes don't justify.\nRich Hightower: Okay. Thanks very much.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question and that is from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Mark, you had quoted an opportunistic mindset in the press release. And I wanted if you could sort of drill down a little bit about what you are implying about having an opportunistic mindset, is it acquisition, is it sale of more assets, is it strategic portfolio reallocations you just talked about stock buybacks what does it encompass?\nMark Parrell : Yeah. Thanks for that question, Michael. It's sort of all of the above. I mean, again, not much going on in the transaction market there is not much of an opportunity for us to demonstrate that opportunistic mindset. But historically, this company is an equity company has always been looking for opportunities to purchase assets at prices that we think will create long-term value. About a year or year and a half after the great financial crisis you saw us by a lot of assets you were part of the industry then so you remember that. We are only four months into the pandemic it feels like a lot longer, but it has only been four months. I'd expect that at some point there would be opportunities maybe their development deals that need to be completed or at least stopped we're quite good at that. Maybe there are opportunities in retail where you've got a lots on existing retailer big boxes that have closed that we can knock down and reposition as apartments or whatnot. So we're open to all of that. I mean I just answered the question on the share buyback that's certainly something we'll keep in mind as well.\nMichael Bilerman: If it sounds being opportunistic is much more on the deployment of capital rather than trying to narrow the gap if you believe your stock trading to big discount selling off a substantial or maybe insubstantial amount of assets and sort of narrow the gap that way? It sounds like you want to be more externally focused than internally focused.\nMark Parrell: I'll take your question I mean whether we could sell enough assets for example and buy enough stock back to close the gap on NAV. And I guess I'd say to you, I don't see that as possible. I think the company is just too large and when you start selling assets and start implicated large tax gains, you start to create other issues you also need to scale the business differently. So I'd tell you, I don't see as likely that we would do a massive stock buyback in an attempt to kind of close that NAV gap. I think what you're likely to see if we do a share buyback is that we just think it's a good investment and a good trade and doesn't preclude other opportunities because that's the big thing on REITs, because you are using capital that you are rather borrowing or you are selling assets, you are changing your opportunity set. And you might make it harder a year from now to take advantage of some of those opportunities we just spoke about.\nMichael Bilerman: Right. The second question I wanted to ask was just in terms of your commentary around cities and urban versus suburban environments and I think you made the comment that we shouldn't write off cities at this point urban environments and I want to sort of drill down in terms of what's your sort of forecast on when city start to recover because clearly there has been a substantial amount of home buying in suburban and generally employers follow talent and if that talent is leaving the urban environments as evidenced by your trend that you talking about in New York City in Brooklyn and in San Francisco. Why wouldn't the corporation's ultimately then move to that over time?\nMark Parrell: Yeah I think...\nMichael Bilerman: And the whole changing nature too of where people are living if they're exiting even at the wealthier aspects and moving where those decision makers may move to. And so what gives you the confidence that it may rebound quicker than what the market is expecting?\nMark Parrell: So we think about that is both the short-term and a long-term question. I mean in the short run in some of these dense urban centers, the ones that Michael just mentioned that are pressured, you are certainly seeing people say, these aren't the urban centers I want to live in right now, because they're not energized, they're not as activated. Over time the pandemic will go away, when is a really good question, but if it isn't. I mean, there will be a point where this pandemic will go away or be lessen and then these cities will open up, and there will be an opportunity for people to move back. And I think our sort of resident who again is someone who has an average household income of $164,000, who at a median age of 33, who's going to work a long day in the biotech industry or as a lawyer or maybe even as a Research Analyst, and they're going to get home at seven or eight o'clock at night, and they're going to say I want to do something with my life, I want to be active and energetic in the market. I don't value just this sedentary lifestyle. So I think the actions that we're seeing that are hurting us right now in our urban centers are all about the here and now. I think as this pandemic wanes, and again, I can't tell you when that is, but it isn't forever then there will be a turn and there will be interest in these markets again, because I don't think anything's changed in the long run. There is still huge network benefits. If you're in the content creation business, there's a lot of benefit being in Los Angeles. If you're in the technology business, there's a lot of benefit to being in Seattle or in San Francisco and the same in the financial field in New York, I think those networks benefits combined with the fact that our demographic tends to value excitement and energy and the urban centers a lot, I think they will be there and work-from-home is a fair question and all of that. And I think I'd answered it by saying, Michael you've been to a lot of our properties even in the middle of the day on a Tuesday before the pandemic, there were plenty of people working from home. I don't think work-from-home and urban living are inconsistent at all. I think when you're done working home, you're happy to wander of and do those exciting things if you like to do culturally and entertainment wise in our markets. So, I guess, I'd tell you I am very confident in the long run. What I can't tell you is, because it's a public health matter is when the pandemic wanes.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. Well, I was always cheerful about those people sitting in their shorts and T-shirts, while we were walking around suits. So now I have a better appreciation for what they have. Thanks for that.\nMark Parrell: Yeah. But we'll see how much fun the Hamptons are in November and how great the Adirondack are in\u2026\nMichael Bilerman: Don't get me wrong mighty, I am ready for an office in environment. I can't live at work anymore.\nMark Parrell: There you go. And I -- go ahead, I'm sorry. Next question please. Thanks Michael.\nOperator: We'll take our next question and that is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Michael, I appreciate your detailed thoughts on the markets. I wanted to talk a little bit more about just New York and San Fran, those markets which are being disproportionately impacted by just employers not coming back to the office. So based on what you see in terms of your schedule move-outs today in New York and San Fran and just a leading demand indicator, what does the trajectory of occupancy look like in these markets these next few months and its trajectory of rental rates as well?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I guess, I would say, right now, they've been very consistent, right. So the urban cores of New York and San Francisco both have been running at a 91%, 91.5% occupancy and the rates as I kind of alluded to it, they were bouncing around we go a few weeks where we find that stability point, so I think our forward outlook for the near-term is consistency on that front. We did see some shifts in like the migration patterns, so we're looking at forwarding addresses for those people that are leaving us. Both New York and San Francisco were the two markets that stood out, that saw a change in behavior from Q2 of 2020 over Q2 of 2019. And New York, typically, we would see about 35% of those residents leaving provide us a forwarding address out of state. In Q2 of 2020 that increased up to 50% and the number one state that they were going to was New Jersey. And San Francisco was a little bit different in that, we didn't really see a strong uptick in those residents that were leaving the State of California, what we saw was is in the city of San Francisco, we saw a pretty pronounced uptick in leaving the MSA and really the number one place they were going to was Santa Clara County. So they were going down. So we're seeing some changes in the patterns, but I think from a consistency and operations standpoint, we've been optimizing revenue at this 91.5% and that's probably where we would expect to see it stay for a little bit.\nMark Parrell: And John, it's Mark. Just to add, there were something we put on page 3 of the release that we just want to draw your attention to. We mentioned that the July 2020 results were about equal to the June results. What we're trying to talk about the rate of change. We talked first about stabilizing occupancy in April and we did that, then we talked about what's going on with new lease and renewals. And for the most part Michael at least for two months, we've stabilized. Now we're not suggesting it is a permanent plateau, but it feels pretty good. That's what Michael means by stability. Now we're fighting the concession battle, and we're working through that and we're happy to talk about that. But it's sort of a step-by-step and I think the sense that things are in some sort of precipitous decline is not how we feel it feels like here at the company. It feels like one thing as and we've got plenty of demand, so the occupancy feels, okay. We feel okay on what our new lease rate and renewals are going to be give or take from July and June being about the same number. And then now we're going to address these concession issues and again the markets reopening are key to that.\nJohn Pawlowski: Sure, I understand. Nobody knows when the market's going to reopen. But I guess, I struggle with the consistency tone because concessions are part of the game and so somebody could argue, a lot of folks private and public operators are buying that floor and occupancy right now. So I guess the concern is New York in the fall or San Fran in the fall you start pushing up against occupancies with a neat handle So New York occupancy going 94.1% in the quarter, sounds like its 92% in July with new leases declining and then concession is getting worse. So I just, I'm struggling with the kind of floor consistency tone it's not just this call, it's other public and private operators out there as well.\nMichael Manelis: So maybe let me just address one thing just on concession use, because I think the markets that we've been talking about just to give you some color. I mean, the portfolio as a whole we have been very consistent about 25% of all of our applications every single week have been getting some form of concession and it's about equivalent to one month. When you look at New York, New York, we've been running about 50% of our applications receiving a concession. And for us, we're typically at about a six week concession in that marketplace and strategically going up to the two month concession. San Francisco, it's like 40% of the applications are receiving a concession, we're predominantly at four weeks and every now and then strategically we go up to six and that's been fairly consistent in our platform for the last month or so the use of concessions and I think as your comment to the fall, I don't know where we're going to be in the fall. I was kind of to alluding to the next kind of 30, 60 days is the how we think the portfolio will play out because we have a little bit of transparency into traffic application volume as well as renewals. At some point here, you're going to sit on the sidelines. So concessions continue to go up, you may just see us park ourselves right at the levels I'm talking about and you may have occupancy kind of decline in the fourth quarter. But I don't know yet how to kind of think about that, I'm kind of forward thinking for the next quarter and how we want to run the portfolio.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, great. Last one from me, could you share what economic occupancy is currently in L.A. versus the physical given the concerns around eviction moratorium's getting extended?\nBob Garechana: Yeah. Hey, John, it's Bob. So for economic occupancy in Los Angeles, specifically and I'm going to give you the quarter numbers so Q2 of 2020, we're at 93.7% that's compared to 94.7% physical occupancy. So about 100 basis point delta. You're correct that Los Angeles is where we've seen the higher delinquency pattern and that corresponded to the higher bad debt write-off. And while we're at it, if you want, I thought I also might talk a little bit about because I know in different notes. We've seen kind of comparability related to both kind of concessions, accounting for concessions and bad debt as well if that makes sense, John to kind of maybe walk the group through that. When looking at bad debt because I think there is some comparability concerns or issues I think it's important that we first kind of take our approach and understand what our policy is so I wanted to take the opportunity to explain that. On the residential side, we continue to apply the same policy we've applied for many years and our policy is as follows; we write-off all of our former resident account balances once they move out. So if you vacated the unit we write it off, a 100% of anything that you owed us and those accounts convert to a cash basis. For residents that continue to occupy the units but still owe us money, we write-off a 100% of their account balance once they reach three times their monthly rent. So from that point forward we convert to a cash basis. So we think that's helpful to understand, we also think it's helpful to understand what the net receivable balance is as of the end of the quarter which we provided in the release. For residential, our net receivable balance before security deposits was about $11.7 million and after security deposit it's about $9 million or a 150 basis points of quarterly revenues. And so in the second quarter, same store reported revenue growth, which I talked about in my prepared remarks, was reduced by about one percentage point overall consistent with this policy. Going into the third quarter, we expect that the bad debt will remain elevated as I mentioned in our residential business. But if collection rates remain the same and consistent, the impact shouldn't be hugely different than the second quarter impact. We continue to be remaining \u2013 we continue to remain diligent on writing off those delinquent accounts. Now non-residential a little bit of a different story and it's more of a tenant-by-tenant analysis. So we continue to account for that on accrual basis but this quarter as you've heard me talk about it, we reserved against pretty much all of the unpaid rent. So effectively converting it to a cash basis and we also wrote-off a portion of the straight line receivable. We continue to monitor that straight line as I mentioned and that's consistent \u2013 that's really more a function of the future prospects of those tenants. And we have a number of those on a watch list and depending on future conditions that could write-off that could result in future write-off. So I thought that be a helpful kind of summary on bad debt because I know as you guys work through the earnings season, you're going to see a difference in kind of how people think about bad debt et cetera. And then finally kind of the other comparability item you might take note on is just concessions. So I wanted to be completely clear that in our same store reported numbers we report in line with GAAP. So what that means is that we run the straight line concession through the reported revenue numbers. And we've done that for a number of years after a general SEC publication, on kind of non-GAAP metrics and encouraging companies to do so. But I'm happy to give you kind of the cash basis numbers by market or in aggregate like I mentioned earlier. So it was a 120 basis points, so we -- so for a residential only, we reported in the second quarter, a 90 basis point decline. If that was on a cash basis, it would have been 120 basis points. If you go to market-by-market that relationship so it be would be a that relationship of being call it 30 basis points down, it's pretty consistent overall. But I'm happy to kind of give you guys those numbers by market. So Boston would have been a negative 1.7%, New York would have been a negative 1.9%, D.C would have been flat, Seattle would have been 1.5%, San Francisco would have been negative 1.4%, L.A. would have been negative 2%, Orange County would have been 90 basis points positive. And San Diego would have been flat. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color in the call, a little bit of color on comparability items.\nJohn Pawlowski: Yeah. No. That's great. Thanks very much for all the details, it's very much appreciated.\nBob Garechana: Great.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll move on to our next question and that is from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nRichard Hill: Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for the details on the bad debt. That was one of my primary questions. And I think that was a very helpful and efficient explanation. I did want to come back to allocation of capital and maybe some of the questions at the beginning. I think there is a case to be made in a lower interest rate regime. And against the backdrop where apartment fundamentals probably still remain quite strong, over the medium to long-term that cap rates can compress. I know there hasn't been a tremendous amount of transaction volume. But I'm curious if you can talk about that. And maybe go back to the previous comments about external growth and maybe you being opportunistic about buying some properties. Does that sort of fit into your thesis in the way you're thinking about things?\nMark Parrell: Yeah. Thank you for that question Rich. We had a conversation, in fact and it was a bit of an off-hand remark on my part, in the last earnings call about cap rates potentially going down. With treasury rates with 10 year at 60 basis points, when you look at the spread of the 10 year to prevailing cap rates, it's very high on a relative basis. So I do think a case can be made because of that. And because of very significant amount of capital that's to your point because of performance long-term, wants to get into the apartment business. So I think again as we talked to private folks there seems to be no lack of capital still interested they are anxious about their underwriting, they're trying to figure things out. But I think there's a lot of people that when the dust settles, will continue to want to allocate capital into the apartment side. So how that impacts external growth? Well, to get more aggressive on your exit cap rate is what your comment implies. And that means that you got to feel comfortable for us that 10 years from now, cap rates will continue to be low. So you just have to be thoughtful about that. So for us the two main inputs in being more aggressive in acquiring assets, would be our thought about growth rates of NOI and then thinking a lot at the end about exit cap rates. And right now we're not in the situation where a lot of external growth is possible. We are certainly not issuing stock at this stock price. So for us it would be mostly recycling. And I think again, we'll have an opportunity to do that because our assets will trade well. Some of them will have renovation possibilities that maybe we don't believe in but maybe the buyer believes in, which is the case in some of the assets we sold recently. And then, we'll be able to get newer stuff with less CapEx and better growth prospects. In your point have opportunities on the capital -- on the cap rate side. I mean, if cap rates compressed we're already sitting on $40 billion of real estate. I mean, I would hope that would benefit us greatly.\nRichard Hill: Okay, helpful. Maybe I can ask the question slightly differently, or maybe take a slightly different perspective. But I could there's obviously a tremendous amount of money on the sidelines with private equity funds, I think by our measure into $370 billion globally. Would you ever consider partnering with a private equity fund that wants to take a longer-term perspective to maybe demonstrate that your net asset value -- where your stock is trading relative net asset value is too cheap?\nMark Parrell: Well, I guess I am going to have to ask you to be more specific. I mean the company doesn't lack capital. I mean if we had -- I lack currently opportunities to allocate capital. We have a ton of debt capacity if we could find say it $0.5 billion of things to buy, above what we could sell. We could easily issue debt to do that in which we are very comfortable doing so. So I don't need anybody else's capital. And I feel on that at least in the way you said it. We like joint ventures, we have a couple. We do more, if they made sense in some way. Maybe it's a risk diversification play, maybe it's because the PE firm has an opportunity lined up, they can execute on operationally. But I don't know that our PE firm would help us for example, validate the value of the company. I think people know what the company's worth, I think folks just think that the next couple of quarters we'll be tough. And so that's what the stock price is reacting to. I'm not sure, I feel like there's a lot of folks that are confused about the platforms long-term value.\nRichard Hill: Yeah. No understood. I was politely trying to ask a question about take private, because I do think that there is a lot of discussions, or a lot of interest from some investors about the lag in REITs and relative to private market valuations and replacement cost. But I assume that's not a question, not a question that you'd be willing to address, on a public earnings call. So, I do appreciate that the feedback. That's very helpful.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question and that is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead with your question.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Just had a question first off, I don't know, if there's any way that you have these stats. But I'm wondering, if you had an idea of how much of your renter base has a job that is actually an office using jobs versus working in a hospital or some other type of industry, which you can't work from home?\nMichael Manelis: We don't really have insight into that. We capture the employer at the time of the application, but we won't have a sense right now. I think it's pretty clear, when you look through the properties that a large percentage of our resident base are working from home.\nNick Yulico: Okay. And sorry, do you have that stat about how much of the portfolio right now you think are employees working from home?\nMichael Manelis: I don't I do not.\nNick Yulico: Okay thanks. The other question was just how we should think about a typical summer leasing period right. I mean, you have \u2013 in certain markets you have students returning to school, you have internships that are created in the summer you have jobs that are created in September sometimes internships turn into jobs they start in September, a lot of that's isn't happening right now obviously. So, is there any way to kind of frame out, how much of that typical benefit from those factors you would get in the summer that probably is not going to happen this time around?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I don't think that there is a way to frame it out. I guess I would tell you in normal seasonal patterns we right now are at a high point in rents. So, if I look back over the past couple of years. This is about the time of the year where rents are the highest and then we start a seasonal decline in rent. And on an occupancy front you kind of have two peaks in the peak leasing season. You have this period right now and then I think what you just alluded to somewhere right around that end of August end of September you have that other high point in occupancy. And I think what we're trying to understand right now given just the demand that we see is, we could be just shifting some of this demand and we could just go longer through September, maybe even into October, where we would start to show greater gains on a year-over-year basis in applications. Doesn't mean you're not going to \u2013 you're still going to be facing pricing pressure, you're still going to be facing concessions in these markets that I've just been discussing. But you still may see a longer runway of the demand profile. And I think it's too early to know, if that really plays out, but that is clearly a possibility that could happen.\nNick Yulico: Okay. That's helpful. Just lastly, I know you guys provide some info on the move-outs in New York and San Francisco, which is interesting in terms of where people are moving. Do you have any stats on when residents are leaving how many of them when you're looking at \u2013 I don't know, if you can figures this out from the following address, if you care or not, but how many are moving into a home whether it's a rental home or a for purchase home? And then, I guess I'm also wondering, how it's working right now within your own portfolio, if you're seeing any trends if you're offering incentives that make it easier to move if the tenant wants to move to a suburban location you can offer that. Any stats you have on those types of issues?\nMichael Manelis: Yeah. So first, I don't have insight as to whether people are moving out to go rent a home. I do get a reasons for move-out. So, if somebody is disclosing that, they're leaving us to go buy a home, we have that stat we have that stat going back in time. We typically run about 12% of those that are leaving provide that reason. Right now, I guess, I would tell you in the second quarter we actually went down a little bit for a reason for move-out to buy home. But a lot of that is just because in April nobody was leaving. I also believe in our markets homes are really expensive to buy. So while kind of we're balancing the move-outs that are occurring we're not seeing people kind of run out to go buy the homes. We did see an uptick in D.C. and Southern California markets, but it was a small increase in that percent on a year-over-year basis.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question and that is from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlua Askarbek: Just a quick one in terms of early terminations, I know you guys mentioned Boston that was an issue early on in the quarter. But have other markets kind of [Technical Difficulty] recently as more companies announce it working from home [Technical Difficulty] early terminations?\nMichael Manelis: So you were kind of breaking up on me. But I believe what your question is around early terminations or lease breaks. And then based on the recent announcements from a few employers have we seen anything take place, is that correct?\nAlua Askarbek: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Manelis: Okay. So first during the quarter, we did see an increase in early terminations or lease breaks. Predominantly, in New York and Boston and very much weighted toward the month of April. If I look at the performance for May, June and even through July right now we're really are not in this period of time where we're seeing more people kind of break their leases with us. But we did experience it in the quarter. As far as the recent announcements I think it's too soon to understand it's something we're clearly watching right now. As Google just made their announcement extending kind of return to the offices until the summer of next year. It's something that we'll be watching in the South Bay and the city of San Francisco to see if we see kind of those individuals kind of leave early. But it's also most likely going to put a little pressure on the renewal conversations. And I still think in a week it's too early for us to see any pattern from that.\nMark Parrell: Yeah. And I'll just add and this is just anecdotal. There are a lot of folks that as the summer wanes is going to want to be back in their normal routine. It's certainly not a bad thing especially when cities are this deactivated to maybe be it some other remote location for those who can't afford are able to do so. But it is a good number of people and I can tell you test to a 20 year old who is in my house, who is very anxious to get out of mom and dad's house and go back to her life in one of the big cities. So, I think that we're also going to see almost no matter whether the employers want it or not a stream of people that are our kind of residents slowly deciding that they've had enough of where they are and they are interested in again trying to be in a little bit more activated environment to potentially see a little bit more of the city that they move to for a reason. So, again I can't predict maybe the pandemic gets worse and that slows down again. But we've had pretty steady demand and I think Michael and I are of the general opinion without certainty being associated with it that the leasing season we'll extend itself. But it won't necessarily be vigorous going into the Q3 early Q4 period.\nAlua Askarbek: Got it. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question and that is from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Thanks, good morning everyone. So Bob I just want to -- just make sure -- simplify the talk about bad debt. There's three buckets every month or every quarter right. There is the 97% collection rate and then of the remaining three there is a deferral that is as recorded as collected in the month and then the bad debt reserve those are the three buckets that we have to deal with every -- depending on the period in question, is that correct?\nBob Garechana: Yeah, that's correct. And I would add that the bad debt reserve isn't just the allowance for doubtful accounts. It's also the write-off of any resident who would have moved out during that period as well.\nRich Anderson: Understood. Okay I just want to make sure that was clean.\nBob Garechana: Correct.\nRich Anderson: Talk a little bit Michael when you were kind of going through the offer at 1% and getting minus 1% on renewals. I don't expect it maybe sort of throw out is the word or the concept of maybe pushing too hard there and if you think about the math, is it greedy to ask for 1% when if you don't keep them you lose the residents you have downtime you have cost of releasing the space and then you take a 8% hit to that because of the new leasing you need to do that to get somebody in the unit. So I'm wondering if you see Equity Residential becoming a little bit more willing to negotiate downward. So you avoid some of these dynamics and take your lumps by renewing at perhaps a lower number than you're doing so far today?\nBob Garechana: Yeah. Well I guess I'll point out. So first and foremost, the 20% that I cited that was receiving some form of increase for July and August. Those are residents that are actually kind of below streets today. So that's why those increases are going out. And the willingness to negotiate I mean that is part of our renewal process and we're going to make sure that we are always being cognizant of what that replacement rent is going to be. And as we're working through these negotiations I mean we go back to the fact that listen the largest thing that people want to avoid is moving. The number one reason they tell us they just don't want to move so they want to work with us.\nRich Anderson: You want that also?\nMichael Manelis: Yeah exactly. So we're being very sensitive to the situation right now especially for those residents that have been financially harm and we're working with residents through this process. So, I think right now just looking into August and even into September, I think our increases are going to stay in this 1%. We have pockets in that suburban portfolio where we can actually start pushing rents up a little bit and those increases will start to grow a little bit. But at the same points you've got pressures that are balancing this out. So I think the process is very fluid and I agree with your point fully. And I think the way we execute is following the mindset that you just shared.\nRich Anderson: Okay, fair enough. And then last question for me to Mark, EQR sort of doubled down on urban in 2016 when you sold to Barry Sternlicht the suburban portfolio and it is so now we're in this mess and you're 55% urban 45% suburban based on your definitions. I'm curious if EQR being the opportunistic entity that you described would be willing if the market sort of allow for this transaction market looked attractive enough not to see urban go down as a percent of total, but go up because you believe so fully that urban is going to come back people want to be there. Could that 55% sort of 65% rather than to 45%? That's my question.\nMark Parrell: Yeah. I - Rich, we're open to buying urban or suburban. We talked about selling Manhan and we buy Manhan. We bought two assets in the suburbs in New Jersey and it just got to make sense. I mean it may have to make sense two ways the property has to make sense, the underwriting of the actual asset and I have to make sense in terms of our total exposure. If there is any small regret we have is just in some submarkets like the Upper West Side in New York, we just had a lot of units. We like New York we did need them all to be in one little area. So we're just trying to spread out a little. And that's been sort of the theme of the last few years is being in our markets but being spread out a little more. So there was an urban asset that underwrote, we wouldn't hesitate to purchase it. It just has to make sense relative to our allocation in that submarket already.\nRich Anderson: Did you say 55% is more likely go down or up in the next couple of years?\nMark Parrell: I was hoping that we would grow and that the urban wouldn't shrink as much as the suburban would grow. But I would think, we'll get rid of a few urban assets here. And there are some older suburban stuff. In fact this quarter both the assets we sold were suburban properties. They were older 50 plus year old suburban assets that where renovation place, but weren't -- from our perspective ones that we wanted to undertake.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Excellent. Thanks very much, everyone.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question and this is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey there, running out of good one left. Rich just took my -- one of my better ones. Hey, I wanted to ask you about the -- I wanted to ask you about cost controls, you mentioned that there is this some things you're doing here in the quarter to help same-store expenses and expect that to continue beyond of the COVID period. Can you add a bit more color or commentary around that and maybe on top of that some comment on tech investments and just quantifying what the opportunity here is, or how we should think about the potential savings either on a dollar or in fact the same-store expense basis over the next couple of years?\nBob Garechana: Great. I'll start on the dollar piece and I'm going to have to take you back a few months before COVID to give you a good frame of reference to be honest with you, I think to give some color. But we had excellent expense control in the second quarter and as I kind of mentioned in my remarks, a lot of that came from the initiatives that Michael talked about. So it is the ability on our frontline, kind of, leasing and admin and other things to convert to a more digital platform to do virtual tours to be more efficient to understand our employee utilization et cetera, and that certainly helped in us achieving our goals in terms of our on-site payroll, reductions right via attritions. So that was incredibly helpful. We also in R&M experience benefits through the deployment of our mobility for our service personnel and our ability to use them as well. And so that impacts the payroll line and the R&M line, because it helps your decision making in terms of staffing. So you can staff internally as opposed to using contractors et cetera. What gets a little bit tough right is that there were other things going on related to COVID in the quarter. And so there were some deferral of expenses and some incremental expenses that I mentioned in both of those categories. But overall I think from a sustainability standpoint. we're running call it 50 to 75 basis points ahead or lower in expense growth than what we would have thought at the beginning of the year before COVID ever occurred. And that's a real positive and it's really those two items that I was talking about.\nMichael Manelis: Yeah. And I think your other question was regarding tech investments?\nHaendel St. Juste : Yes.\nMichael Manelis: So I think first we are involved in two different tech funds one with [indiscernible] and one with Navitas, which really kind of just helps us stay on top of the new technologies that are emerging not only in our own industry, but really other industries to see the applicability for us. And I think this is still an area that we're pretty excited about on a go-forward basis that there is still opportunities out there to improve the efficiencies of the operations in these platforms, and it will come from technology. I think later this year, we\u2019ll be deploying our sales technology piece, which is moving a 100% of our sales process to a mobile app and we're beginning piloting that shortly. Similar to what we just did on the service side of the business. You'll see us continue to move forward and explore building access, smart home access. So there's still a lot of opportunities for our industry to advance technology to increase efficiencies.\nHaendel St. Juste: That's helpful. Thank you. And Mark you mentioned earlier, I understand there is a few transactions on the market that have closed here they weren't likely done or they were negotiated pre-COVID, curious if you're hearing or seeing anything in the shadow market. What buyers are underwriting right now and maybe what IRRs they are targeting? And then curious on when do you think, New York City NOI returns -- same-store NOI returns positive, is that 2022 or could we be looking at 2023 here? Thanks.\nMark Parrell: All right. Well, in terms of what other folks are underwriting, I would say the first question I had for the Chief Investment Officer over the course of the quarter was are we seeing more from brokers, is there actually shadow stuff going on? And the answer is a very little going on right now. So there doesn't seem to be like there's this pent up desire to sell assets in the apartment business and not a whole bunch of stuff that the brokers are looking at and hoping to get out soon of the marketplace. So I don't know if I have any insight into how other people are underwriting except that when we talked to private equity sponsors and other private real estate investors they continue to be very interested in the space. That whatever turbulence we have right now is not just persuading them from long-term interest in our space. So I think that's good. In terms of hazarding a guess on New York that requires a couple of things, I mean next year you're going to be pretty aggressive on real estate tax appeals in New York because taxes in New York for properties are in part based on their incomes and certainly we're going to all have different incomes than we had hoped for, for 2020, and we'll be looking like we did in the Great Recession for relief and we obtained that relief in our markets and we would hope to do that again. I'm not sure that's going to change 2021. There's a certain trajectory and your question implied it. These quarters, because of the rent roll is deteriorating, the quarters will keep getting worse for a while. And then that sort of rate of change on some of these new lease and renewal numbers will change. And then, the whole thing will turn around, and that just takes time. So, I really can't hazard a guess on when New York changes, especially when you talk about NOI, because that implicates for New York property taxes. So, in New York, it's very hard for me to think about how that might, but I would hope that they would be less of an increase or a little bit of a decrease in 2021.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question, and that is from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlex Kalmus: Thank you for taking my question. I'm looking at your concession results, are concession's consistent across the studio one-bed, two-bed product or are they over-exposed to the one-bedroom products?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I guess I would tell you in the urban cores there. They're are pretty much sitting on most of the unit types there. We are seeing the lowest occupancy in our studios, specifically in like downtown or Manhattan areas, City of Boston. Those unit types are pressured, but the concessions right now are pretty much across the board on Unit types. The ones that are being used I think the demand coming in. We are seeing demand for one-bedroom. We're also seeing demand for two-bedroom. So I think the concessions flowing through to the revenues are probably slanted more toward the one and two bedrooms than the studios, just because the application count on studios is not as high.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it, makes sense. And just taking a three to five year view, considering the shifting demographics and the millennial older cohort moving to the suburbs potentially for single-family homes, because they are now having kids and a softer Generation Z coming up, would you rather be overweight any one of these products in particular.\nMark Parrell: So, it's Mark. I guess I like having a variety of these. I mean I think studios have an advantage of being the lowest price ticket. So, the pandemic, again, feels like it's gone on forever and will continue at some point it won't. And then people who are new to a market and new to their job and maybe working their way up as a professional, will look to a studio as a great way to get on trend in the big cities. So, I'm happy to own a little bit of a variety of these products. I wouldn't want to own all two's, all one-bedroom, all of anything. And so we've tried to be thoughtful about low ticket. So we do have a good number of studios and one-bedrooms in the markets. But, we do have plenty of twos and a few threes. These large unit types are hard for us to clear. I'll tell you consistently. We have a harder time renting three and four-bedroom units in our buildings, and they tend to be competing against luxury product and condos and stuff. So, I think studios ones and twos are where it's at for us and I'd like a nice mix of that notwithstanding your comment. And I would point out I mean Gen Z is a very large group as well, and we don't know their preferences, but I have a few of them living with me, and they talk a lot about both moving out to my house and moving to a city.\nAlex Kalmus: Make a lot of sense. Thank you very much.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question, and that is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. You guys mentioned a limited amount of concessions that you are offering on renewals. I have noticed that you change your definition on renewal rent growth to no longer being effective growth number? And I'm just wondering why you changed that definition?\nBob Garechana: So we haven't changed the definition. We've always given renewal rate growth excluding concessions, and we also have given new lease excluding concessions as well. What we gave you instead to gave you a concept. And in the past, to be honest with you, the concessions were selling immaterial that, neither one of those numbers or the blended rate would have been any different. What we gave you in addition this quarter is we gave you the effective blended lease rate, which is with the impact of the concessions. So you can see the blended impact with and without concessions.\nJohn Kim: Is that something that you could break out going forward by market?\nMark Parrell: So your request is to see renewal rates by market net of renewal concessions?\nJohn Kim: Well, I guess the effective rental growth rate by markets, which would be...\nBob Garechana: The blended rate.\nJohn Kim: The blended rate, correct.\nMark Parrell: Sure.\nBob Garechana: We'll take that. We can take that.\nJohn Kim: Have you discussed your plans for your retail or your non-residential part of your portfolio? Do you plan to just retain that as a retail, or is there a potential to convert this to others?\nMark Parrell: Yeah. I mean we're still working through things with our retail tenants. We're hopeful we're able to save a few of those folks as the city try to reopen. But one of the conversations we've had as a group several times now is in properties, and this alluded to the question Michael just addressed a moment ago. In these markets where we do have buildings that have studio apartments, could we repurpose of the retail as office space for those studio folks. As amenity space they could go to, a lounge of sorts, is that something that would be useful, you would need to put a lot of TI in that, that's just some lounge furniture and really good Internet connection. And again, not office space for the general public. But could you get a change of use in that retail and that would likely require rezoning and so it's kind of easier said than done. But that is intriguing to me, as you see retail footprint shrink in general. The idea of having unslightly vacant retail isn't very appealing. And the idea of taking on additional retail risk isn't that exciting. So maybe there is an opportunity here to be at service to our existing residents, put our square footage to use. So that's one of the ideas we've been kicking around.\nJohn Kim: Okay great. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question and that is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hello. Good morning and thank you. Mark certainly appreciate your comments on the premature arbitrary for urban. Certainly a healthy discussion, but you brought up an interesting point of your children living at home, looking to get out and live in the cities. Right now, you guys said your average ages 33 with average income, I think, you said $160,000. If there is sort of a shift here, were that older demographic, sort of, moves out and buys homes. And then the cities are still populated by the young singles, you feel that your portfolio as is positioned right now at the price point is commensurate to, let's say, a late '20s crowd that's not earning that $160,000 that may only be earning, let's say, upper $90,000s or $100,000. Just sort of curious, if there is a generational shift, how you feel that your portfolio would line-up to that from a price standpoint?\nMark Parrell: Yeah. I'd start by saying, for example, in New York City, only 10% of our residents have children. So notwithstanding the age list you had, we also have people in their 20\u2019s who are earning a good living, or people in our one-bedrooms who are two people, right, they\u2019re a couple of living there. So, I guess, that's certainly a theory, but it's not anything we've sort of seen. I mean, these are really deep. When you look at the number of people in these markets making over $100,000 or $150,000 that's one the thing that's really exciting about our markets. This is a really big group of people. When you go to some of the smaller markets, you have a good growth of that number of high earners as renters. But it's just a small absolute number, Alex, and I worry that most of those folks are going to buy homes anyway. So, I guess, I'd tell you, I appreciate the theory, I\u2019ve not seen any evidence of it. And our demographic doesn't tend to be like seemingly that anxious to buy a home. I mean, we are seeing a little in New York, as Michael said, folks moving out of New York City and out of New York proper. But they're mostly moving in New Jersey and I wonder if, when they get the all clear sign, some of them don't go back to Manhattan. So I just -- I'm not as convinced as you are that this is some sort of permanent change the pandemic has brought. I think the pandemic has put a lot of people on their heels about living in an urban environment right at the moment, especially in the summer. And I think people will constantly reappraise that decision. I mean, I lived in a city for a reason before.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, the second question is, just thinking to the November election. Clearly, New York underwent a change when democrats took over Albany in 2018. Given some of the rhetoric on the progressive platform, do you guys have concerns about increased regulation on housing and moratoriums and rent control, etcetera, if the dems win the Senate and the White House? And how do you think the industry is sort of preparing itself based on lessons learned over the past few years?\nMark Parrell: Yeah it's a good question. I put aside the party labels and the rest and just speak to policy. I mean, I do think that additional regulatory burdens and are a fair number of those that are being added in our markets, some of them related to this valid COVID emergency and some of us -- some of them seem almost opportunistic by activist groups to me. These are just going to restrict the amount of investment in housing. And that's the message we're trying to get across, as these limits you're putting in place, which kind of feel emotionally good to some folks, are just not going to work, that they're going to end up with housing at substandard, there is going to be less build, that it's all bad. And some of these ideas, again, and I think it's in the house package, so I believe it's a democrat idea, is to give the state money in bulk grants for the states to pass out directly to landlords or folks that are under stress from COVID. So, again, I don't know what will end up in the final package, but I think the idea of upholding the system and encouraging it to produce additional units. So I'd say what the industry is doing right now, is trying to do a little bit of an education campaign to have conversations with people about what's effective regulation and what isn't. And then, trying to help think that through. Could there be some zoning reform? Could there be more affordable units built with market rate? Could we address it that way, as oppose to these sort of rent regulation, some of the other stuff that folks have floated, that economists universally say, it's going to end up creating more problems than solutions for sure.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you, Mark.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mark Parrell for any closing comments.\nMark Parrell: We thank you all for your time on the call and have a good rest of the summer. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees during the second quarter. Despite very challenging operating conditions, the team was able to focus on the health and safety of their fellow employees and our residents by implementing our new operating standards to address COVID concerns. These heightened cleanliness standards have been well received by residents and prospects. The team elevated their voices in various listening sessions held throughout our organization to share how they were navigating and managing stress due to the unrest in our country. Their voices will help us continue to cultivate a culture of inclusion at Equity Residential. They stayed on top of delinquency by executing a consistent and transparent process that emphasize frequent communication with residents who are financially impacted by the virus. Our collection rate remained strong and fairly stable throughout the quarter, with a little over 97% being collected. They focused on retaining existing residents, as evidenced by turnover at 11.8% for the quarter, which is a 130 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019. This was driven by a 10% reduction in move-outs during the quarter, as more residents opted to stay in place. Achieved renewal rate increases were positive 70 basis points for the quarter, but we expect this number to trend lower as negotiations become more challenging. Right now about 20% of our renewal offers for July and August include a slight market rate increase. The team also adopted new technologies for both sales and service that allowed us to meet the needs of our customers while creating operating efficiencies, which contributed to the low growth in our operating expenses. As to occupancy, we stated on the last call that we expected the occupancy impact to be the most pronounced in the second quarter, setting a new base from which we've hoped we would improve as shelter-in-place orders were lifted that so far appears to be the case. The portfolio was 95% occupied today and we average 94.9% through the quarter after recovering from a 94.2% low point in mid-May. On the rate side, since last week in May, base rents have been relatively stable, but this is bit of a bifurcated story. Pricing remains challenged in the urban cores of New York the city of Boston and Downtown San Francisco, which represents about one quarter of our portfolio. The rest of the portfolio is showing more price stability. The rents are still lower than last year. New lease change was down 7% this quarter for our same-store portfolio, before concessions. New lease concessions during the quarter, were heavily concentrated in the urban cores of New York, San Francisco and Boston. Factoring in concessions, the net effective new lease change for the portfolio during the quarter was down 9%. Overall traffic and application activity improved throughout the quarter as net effective prices were being lowered. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, application activity was recovering at the end of April and continued to do so through the remainder of the quarter. By late May and into June, we are seeing somewhat higher new applications week-over-week relative to the same periods in 2019. This improvement, however, was not sufficient to make up for the nearly 40% year-over-year reduction experienced in April. As a result, the total number of move-ins for the second quarter, were 20% below the second quarter of 2019. At present, we think it is helpful to split our portfolio into three pieces as we think about our forward operating performance. First, our suburban assets, which represents approximately 45% of the company's portfolio, have been more resilient during the pandemic with occupancy declining to a low point of 95.2% before recovering fully to levels at or above prior year and ending the quarter at t 96.6%. Suburban renewal percent was very strong at 65% and continues to trend well above prior year. Rates have been slowly recovering since early May, and there have been very limited concessions used in this portfolio. Second, our urban assets that are located in the city of Boston and Cambridge, Manhattan and Brooklyn and Downtown San Francisco, which represents about 25% of the company's portfolio and is currently 91% occupied. As stated earlier, this portfolio has the highest use of concessions and the most rate pressure. For the quarter, this urban portfolio renewed 58% of residents, which is 500 basis points lower than Q2 of 2019 and was trending down throughout the quarter ending at 53% in June. The urban cores in Boston, New York and San Francisco have the highest risk of volatility in operations for the balance of the year. Our third grouping, consist of urban assets and other markets like Washington D.C., Seattle and Southern California and consist of about 30% of our portfolio. These assets reached the low point in occupancy of 94% in mid-May, but quickly bounce back and remained at 95.2%. Pricing has been stable since the middle of May, with rates being down year-over-year and concessions being used on about 15% of our applications. During the quarter, 57% of residents renewed from these assets, which is 300 basis points better than the second quarter of 2019. Overall, this group of urban assets has had consistent operations for the past two months with a slight uptick in occupancy in the past couple of weeks. Let me provide some quick color on the markets. Starting with Boston, the urban center of Boston and Cambridge represent about three quarters of our total Boston portfolio and were more impacted by early termination in non-renewals from international students and third party corporate providers, while neither one of these represent a significant amount of total units, the impact was concentrated. The Boston urban center is now 91.5% occupied and continues to be pressured on rates and occupancy, especially given the uncertainty around international students and the competitive supply being delivered. The other submarkets in Boston have been operating at 95%, with consistent rates and very little concession use. Overall, applications have been running at or above prior year for the entire market as we see good demand for our product. We continue to like this market long-term due to its combination of bio, education and technology jobs and the high quality of lifestyle. Washington D.C. continues to demonstrate some resilience, although the market has not escape pricing pressure. Absorption of new supply continues, and the use of concessions, remain extremely limited in our portfolio. Applications have been running at prior year levels and the portfolio is 95.8% occupied. Moving on to New York, which continues to be one of our most challenging markets. Leasing traffic and application volume returned to 2019 levels by mid-May, but at reduced rental rates and higher levels of concessions. The leasing traffic in the city is heavily centered around local bargain hunters who are moving within the market and searching for a deal. Concession use is widespread with about 50% of our applications receiving concessions, which now average greater than one month. While the application count has recovered to prior year levels this was not enough to make up for the deficit created by the lack of volume in April. Retention started strong in the quarter but has since moderated. During June we renewed 57% of our renewal offered, which is strong by all accounts but lower than June of 2019. Our assets on the Hudson Waterfront, New Jersey, which is about a quarter of our New York exposure have performed better than Manhattan and Brooklyn. We have held 95% occupancy on the Waterfront for the past month and while concessions are being used, it's at a lower level than in Manhattan. Our New York same-store portfolio including New Jersey is about 92% occupied today. Recovery in Manhattan and Brooklyn will take some time but if office re-openings begin in early 2021 as currently expected and the city continues to show good progress on controlling the virus, we may see higher than usual demand later this year and early next year during a period when demand is typically seasonally soft. Heading over to the West Coast, Seattle delivered the strongest revenue results in the quarter both in terms of absolute revenue growth and the combined impact of new lease change and renewals. The portfolio is 95.3% occupied today and overall revenue performance has been very consistent since early April, although pricing decelerated slightly through what normally is the growth period of peak leasing season. We have not seen big layoffs in tech jobs in the market, but we are keeping an eye on employers like Amazon, who last week announced that they were extending their corporate office employees working from home until early January and have delayed new hire start dates from August into September, October. Overall, this trend may cause some short-term pressure on demand and occupancy, but could also provide a boost to the fourth quarter, which typically slows down. San Francisco's revenue performance is very different depending on the submarket, most notably between urban and suburban. Our portfolio in this market is approximately 30% urban and 70% suburban. In the city of San Francisco, we are seeing declining rents that are presently well into the double-digits year-over-year and represents the largest year-over-year decline in our entire portfolio. The city also has widespread concession use at/or above four weeks and has experienced the biggest impact from start-up layoffs and the lack of foreign immigration. Our suburban portfolio located in the Peninsula South Bay and East Bay, as well as the few urban assets that we have in those submarkets stabilized in early May. While rates are down on a year-over-year basis here, they have been holding in place for over a month with very limited use of concessions. The South Bay is still at risk as new supply enters that submarket at a time when the large tech companies have slowed growth and are trying to figure out longer term work-from-home policies. That said the San Francisco Bay Area remains a great place to live, tech companies remain a strong high wage job growth engine and the long-term outlook remains positive. Heading to Southern California, overall pricing is down in L.A. but very stable through June with very little concession used in our portfolio. L.A. is 96.1% occupied today West L.A. remains the most challenged submarket, but even here occupancy recovered to 94.1% and the Downtown submarket, which currently has supply pressure has been stable at 95%, although rent declines are the most pronounced in this submarket. Overall, we are seeing strength in the suburban submarkets of L.A., which is about 45% of our L.A. portfolio. This strength is mitigating the rate and occupancy declines in Downtown, Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire in West LA. While the high levels of competitive supply being delivered in the second half of the year, recent spike in COVID cases and the reversal a phased opening plans for the market are certainly potential short-term negatives. But content creation and technology job story in this large diverse market remains positive. We think jobs in L.A. have the potential to grow even more strongly coming out of the pandemic in order to meet the increasing demand for new online content. Finally, Orange County and San Diego are both performing well with occupancy above prior year and very limited downward pressure on rates. These are beyond challenging times, but our business is demonstrating resilience and our teams have shown that they can deliver. At this point, I will turn the call over to Bob. Morning. Yeah. Hey, Rich. This is Michael. So I guess, I would start and say really for the past couple of months the performance in renewals has been relatively consistent. So the comment about 20% having in increase that's the quotes going out the door. And you need to remember we're still subject to a lot of various rent freezes in place. So you are correct 80% of our offers that went out for July and August include no increase. The negotiation process has been very consistent. We're kind of quoting about a one and we're achieving about a negative one. So about a 200 basis point spread on that performance. Yeah. So we're not doing a lot of renewal concessions or we haven't been in the portfolio. I think we've seen a handful in the quarter in New York but it's very insignificant dollar amounts. Well, I guess, I would say, right now, they've been very consistent, right. So the urban cores of New York and San Francisco both have been running at a 91%, 91.5% occupancy and the rates as I kind of alluded to it, they were bouncing around we go a few weeks where we find that stability point, so I think our forward outlook for the near-term is consistency on that front. We did see some shifts in like the migration patterns, so we're looking at forwarding addresses for those people that are leaving us. Both New York and San Francisco were the two markets that stood out, that saw a change in behavior from Q2 of 2020 over Q2 of 2019. And New York, typically, we would see about 35% of those residents leaving provide us a forwarding address out of state. In Q2 of 2020 that increased up to 50% and the number one state that they were going to was New Jersey. And San Francisco was a little bit different in that, we didn't really see a strong uptick in those residents that were leaving the State of California, what we saw was is in the city of San Francisco, we saw a pretty pronounced uptick in leaving the MSA and really the number one place they were going to was Santa Clara County. So they were going down. So we're seeing some changes in the patterns, but I think from a consistency and operations standpoint, we've been optimizing revenue at this 91.5% and that's probably where we would expect to see it stay for a little bit. So maybe let me just address one thing just on concession use, because I think the markets that we've been talking about just to give you some color. I mean, the portfolio as a whole we have been very consistent about 25% of all of our applications every single week have been getting some form of concession and it's about equivalent to one month. When you look at New York, New York, we've been running about 50% of our applications receiving a concession. And for us, we're typically at about a six week concession in that marketplace and strategically going up to the two month concession. San Francisco, it's like 40% of the applications are receiving a concession, we're predominantly at four weeks and every now and then strategically we go up to six and that's been fairly consistent in our platform for the last month or so the use of concessions and I think as your comment to the fall, I don't know where we're going to be in the fall. I was kind of to alluding to the next kind of 30, 60 days is the how we think the portfolio will play out because we have a little bit of transparency into traffic application volume as well as renewals. At some point here, you're going to sit on the sidelines. So concessions continue to go up, you may just see us park ourselves right at the levels I'm talking about and you may have occupancy kind of decline in the fourth quarter. But I don't know yet how to kind of think about that, I'm kind of forward thinking for the next quarter and how we want to run the portfolio. We don't really have insight into that. We capture the employer at the time of the application, but we won't have a sense right now. I think it's pretty clear, when you look through the properties that a large percentage of our resident base are working from home. I don't I do not. Well, I don't think that there is a way to frame it out. I guess I would tell you in normal seasonal patterns we right now are at a high point in rents. So, if I look back over the past couple of years. This is about the time of the year where rents are the highest and then we start a seasonal decline in rent. And on an occupancy front you kind of have two peaks in the peak leasing season. You have this period right now and then I think what you just alluded to somewhere right around that end of August end of September you have that other high point in occupancy. And I think what we're trying to understand right now given just the demand that we see is, we could be just shifting some of this demand and we could just go longer through September, maybe even into October, where we would start to show greater gains on a year-over-year basis in applications. Doesn't mean you're not going to \u2013 you're still going to be facing pricing pressure, you're still going to be facing concessions in these markets that I've just been discussing. But you still may see a longer runway of the demand profile. And I think it's too early to know, if that really plays out, but that is clearly a possibility that could happen. Yeah. So first, I don't have insight as to whether people are moving out to go rent a home. I do get a reasons for move-out. So, if somebody is disclosing that, they're leaving us to go buy a home, we have that stat we have that stat going back in time. We typically run about 12% of those that are leaving provide that reason. Right now, I guess, I would tell you in the second quarter we actually went down a little bit for a reason for move-out to buy home. But a lot of that is just because in April nobody was leaving. I also believe in our markets homes are really expensive to buy. So while kind of we're balancing the move-outs that are occurring we're not seeing people kind of run out to go buy the homes. We did see an uptick in D.C. and Southern California markets, but it was a small increase in that percent on a year-over-year basis. So you were kind of breaking up on me. But I believe what your question is around early terminations or lease breaks. And then based on the recent announcements from a few employers have we seen anything take place, is that correct? Okay. So first during the quarter, we did see an increase in early terminations or lease breaks. Predominantly, in New York and Boston and very much weighted toward the month of April. If I look at the performance for May, June and even through July right now we're really are not in this period of time where we're seeing more people kind of break their leases with us. But we did experience it in the quarter. As far as the recent announcements I think it's too soon to understand it's something we're clearly watching right now. As Google just made their announcement extending kind of return to the offices until the summer of next year. It's something that we'll be watching in the South Bay and the city of San Francisco to see if we see kind of those individuals kind of leave early. But it's also most likely going to put a little pressure on the renewal conversations. And I still think in a week it's too early for us to see any pattern from that. Yeah exactly. So we're being very sensitive to the situation right now especially for those residents that have been financially harm and we're working with residents through this process. So, I think right now just looking into August and even into September, I think our increases are going to stay in this 1%. We have pockets in that suburban portfolio where we can actually start pushing rents up a little bit and those increases will start to grow a little bit. But at the same points you've got pressures that are balancing this out. So I think the process is very fluid and I agree with your point fully. And I think the way we execute is following the mindset that you just shared. Yeah. And I think your other question was regarding tech investments? So I think first we are involved in two different tech funds one with [indiscernible] and one with Navitas, which really kind of just helps us stay on top of the new technologies that are emerging not only in our own industry, but really other industries to see the applicability for us. And I think this is still an area that we're pretty excited about on a go-forward basis that there is still opportunities out there to improve the efficiencies of the operations in these platforms, and it will come from technology. I think later this year, we'll be deploying our sales technology piece, which is moving a 100% of our sales process to a mobile app and we're beginning piloting that shortly. Similar to what we just did on the service side of the business. You'll see us continue to move forward and explore building access, smart home access. So there's still a lot of opportunities for our industry to advance technology to increase efficiencies. Well, I guess I would tell you in the urban cores there. They're are pretty much sitting on most of the unit types there. We are seeing the lowest occupancy in our studios, specifically in like downtown or Manhattan areas, City of Boston. Those unit types are pressured, but the concessions right now are pretty much across the board on Unit types. The ones that are being used I think the demand coming in. We are seeing demand for one-bedroom. We're also seeing demand for two-bedroom. So I think the concessions flowing through to the revenues are probably slanted more toward the one and two bedrooms than the studios, just because the application count on studios is not as high."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. During one of the most challenging periods in our country and industry's history, we feel that our business showed considerable resiliency. We continue to be pleased with the financial strength of our customer base, with our average annual household incomes of $164,000. Data suggests that only 4% of workers, making more than $150,000 a year, have recently lost their jobs compared to the low-teens for lower income categories. We have collected about 97% of our residential rents during the second quarter and attribute this to a customer base that remains well-employed and capable of meeting their obligations. July is trending similarly. We also demonstrated strong expense results, while the pandemic both added and subtracted costs from our operations, the innovations around leasing and service that we described in prior calls have really taken hold and we expect a durable reduction in our expense growth rate even after COVID is in the rear view mirror. And while our 90 basis point decline in same store residential revenue was our first quarterly revenue decline in 10 years, our residential business held up reasonably well under very trying circumstances. We also believe that we have stabilized our physical occupancy at 95%. In a moment, Michael will give you some color on what is going on in each of our markets and Bob will address our expenses, non-residential operations and balance sheet. And then, we will welcome your questions. But before I turn it over, I want to highlight a couple of things. First, in the quarter, we stabilized two development properties, one in Cambridge, Massachusetts and another in Seattle, Washington. The Cambridge asset is a 64-unit property, adjacent to an existing asset of ours and was built for $47 million and stabilize at approximately 5% yield on cost. This property complements our large existing Cambridge portfolio of six properties with about a 1,100 units and is ideally suited to house the biotech employees working in that area. The other property consists of 137 units and is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle and cost $65 million to build. It stabilized at about a 5% yield on cost. In terms of transactions, we're pleased to close on two dispositions during the quarter and have sold more than $750 million in assets during 2020. We feel that we received strong pricing on this quarter sales, as both sold assets were over 50 years old and our combined disposition yield was 4.4%. But we note that these sales were priced prior to the pandemic and so shouldn't be seen as a look through on current pricing. We have not acquired anything this year, but we like to think of ourselves as professional opportunists and have a balance sheet that as strong as it has ever been, which will allow us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. And now a bit about our capital allocation strategy. We have spoken on prior calls about the company broadening its portfolio by expanding into Denver and into the dense suburbs of our markets. For the last few years, we've been actively pruning our exposure in some urban locations, including Manhattan, and buying more dense suburban assets. Our current portfolio mix stands at about 55% urban and 45% suburban. We will continue to build and buy apartments in locations, both urban and dense suburban, where affluent renters wish to live and in markets where we feel long-term returns will be maximized. We believe that our strategy is sufficiently flexible to retain high-quality urban properties, while adding some breath of the portfolio over time, so we can continue to produce a reliable and growing stream of income for our shareholders. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Thanks, Bob. And a final note while we fully acknowledge that the next few quarters will be difficult, the cities in which we operate have shown great resilience over time and while some of them are certainly challenged today, we believe that they will bounce back when we reach the other side of this pandemic. We expect that these cities will remain at the center of the knowledge-based economy and will continue to attract high income renters. We think that the obituaries for the great urban centers have been written much too prematurely. The world's great cities have continued to adapt and thrive over time and they will do so again. We appreciate the continued support we have received from the investment community as we navigate the current storms and look forward to coming out of this pandemic well-positioned for long-term growth. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for the Q&A session. Morning. Wow Rich that's a compound question. Thank you for that. So we'll start by just talking -- That's all right I will just talk about values and we'll start with the private market. I mean in the quarter, there just hasn't been that much activity. We think activity in our markets for our kinds of assets meaning assets with over 50 units that are of our type of quality, we're probably down 70% in the second quarter. So what I'm about to tell you is based on pretty limited volume. But it seems to us that the private market values have held in there. So we've seen a few deals trade in Downtown Seattle stuff in North side of the suburban Denver, Complex in Washington D.C. and the Virginia side then a couple of these New York deals that we've been watching, but they haven't closed. Those are all trading at values that indicate to us that the pandemic has not taken private market values down or not taken them down very much at all. But again, very small sample sizes in fairness. And then you asked about share repurchases. Well certainly the company rarely trades at this significant a discount to NAV. I mean this is very unusual for us. I'm not at all dismissive of share buybacks I would just tell you that you start as a REIT with the inability to retain earnings. So -- and you start also with the ability to return capital through a pretty large dividend. Our annual dividend is $900 million of capital returned to shareholders every year. So I'd say to you that we're open to it, we have a $13 million share allocation on the share buyback side, that's a conversation we'll continue between the Board and myself and we'll think more on that. But I will say this is pretty unprecedented for us to trade at this discount. And I think again as far as I can tell private market value changes don't justify. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for that question, Michael. It's sort of all of the above. I mean, again, not much going on in the transaction market there is not much of an opportunity for us to demonstrate that opportunistic mindset. But historically, this company is an equity company has always been looking for opportunities to purchase assets at prices that we think will create long-term value. About a year or year and a half after the great financial crisis you saw us by a lot of assets you were part of the industry then so you remember that. We are only four months into the pandemic it feels like a lot longer, but it has only been four months. I'd expect that at some point there would be opportunities maybe their development deals that need to be completed or at least stopped we're quite good at that. Maybe there are opportunities in retail where you've got a lots on existing retailer big boxes that have closed that we can knock down and reposition as apartments or whatnot. So we're open to all of that. I mean I just answered the question on the share buyback that's certainly something we'll keep in mind as well. I'll take your question I mean whether we could sell enough assets for example and buy enough stock back to close the gap on NAV. And I guess I'd say to you, I don't see that as possible. I think the company is just too large and when you start selling assets and start implicated large tax gains, you start to create other issues you also need to scale the business differently. So I'd tell you, I don't see as likely that we would do a massive stock buyback in an attempt to kind of close that NAV gap. I think what you're likely to see if we do a share buyback is that we just think it's a good investment and a good trade and doesn't preclude other opportunities because that's the big thing on REITs, because you are using capital that you are rather borrowing or you are selling assets, you are changing your opportunity set. And you might make it harder a year from now to take advantage of some of those opportunities we just spoke about. Yeah I think... So we think about that is both the short-term and a long-term question. I mean in the short run in some of these dense urban centers, the ones that Michael just mentioned that are pressured, you are certainly seeing people say, these aren't the urban centers I want to live in right now, because they're not energized, they're not as activated. Over time the pandemic will go away, when is a really good question, but if it isn't. I mean, there will be a point where this pandemic will go away or be lessen and then these cities will open up, and there will be an opportunity for people to move back. And I think our sort of resident who again is someone who has an average household income of $164,000, who at a median age of 33, who's going to work a long day in the biotech industry or as a lawyer or maybe even as a Research Analyst, and they're going to get home at seven or eight o'clock at night, and they're going to say I want to do something with my life, I want to be active and energetic in the market. I don't value just this sedentary lifestyle. So I think the actions that we're seeing that are hurting us right now in our urban centers are all about the here and now. I think as this pandemic wanes, and again, I can't tell you when that is, but it isn't forever then there will be a turn and there will be interest in these markets again, because I don't think anything's changed in the long run. There is still huge network benefits. If you're in the content creation business, there's a lot of benefit being in Los Angeles. If you're in the technology business, there's a lot of benefit to being in Seattle or in San Francisco and the same in the financial field in New York, I think those networks benefits combined with the fact that our demographic tends to value excitement and energy and the urban centers a lot, I think they will be there and work-from-home is a fair question and all of that. And I think I'd answered it by saying, Michael you've been to a lot of our properties even in the middle of the day on a Tuesday before the pandemic, there were plenty of people working from home. I don't think work-from-home and urban living are inconsistent at all. I think when you're done working home, you're happy to wander of and do those exciting things if you like to do culturally and entertainment wise in our markets. So, I guess, I'd tell you I am very confident in the long run. What I can't tell you is, because it's a public health matter is when the pandemic wanes. Yeah. But we'll see how much fun the Hamptons are in November and how great the Adirondack are in... There you go. And I -- go ahead, I'm sorry. Next question please. Thanks Michael. And John, it's Mark. Just to add, there were something we put on page 3 of the release that we just want to draw your attention to. We mentioned that the July 2020 results were about equal to the June results. What we're trying to talk about the rate of change. We talked first about stabilizing occupancy in April and we did that, then we talked about what's going on with new lease and renewals. And for the most part Michael at least for two months, we've stabilized. Now we're not suggesting it is a permanent plateau, but it feels pretty good. That's what Michael means by stability. Now we're fighting the concession battle, and we're working through that and we're happy to talk about that. But it's sort of a step-by-step and I think the sense that things are in some sort of precipitous decline is not how we feel it feels like here at the company. It feels like one thing as and we've got plenty of demand, so the occupancy feels, okay. We feel okay on what our new lease rate and renewals are going to be give or take from July and June being about the same number. And then now we're going to address these concession issues and again the markets reopening are key to that. Yeah. Thank you for that question Rich. We had a conversation, in fact and it was a bit of an off-hand remark on my part, in the last earnings call about cap rates potentially going down. With treasury rates with 10 year at 60 basis points, when you look at the spread of the 10 year to prevailing cap rates, it's very high on a relative basis. So I do think a case can be made because of that. And because of very significant amount of capital that's to your point because of performance long-term, wants to get into the apartment business. So I think again as we talked to private folks there seems to be no lack of capital still interested they are anxious about their underwriting, they're trying to figure things out. But I think there's a lot of people that when the dust settles, will continue to want to allocate capital into the apartment side. So how that impacts external growth? Well, to get more aggressive on your exit cap rate is what your comment implies. And that means that you got to feel comfortable for us that 10 years from now, cap rates will continue to be low. So you just have to be thoughtful about that. So for us the two main inputs in being more aggressive in acquiring assets, would be our thought about growth rates of NOI and then thinking a lot at the end about exit cap rates. And right now we're not in the situation where a lot of external growth is possible. We are certainly not issuing stock at this stock price. So for us it would be mostly recycling. And I think again, we'll have an opportunity to do that because our assets will trade well. Some of them will have renovation possibilities that maybe we don't believe in but maybe the buyer believes in, which is the case in some of the assets we sold recently. And then, we'll be able to get newer stuff with less CapEx and better growth prospects. In your point have opportunities on the capital -- on the cap rate side. I mean, if cap rates compressed we're already sitting on $40 billion of real estate. I mean, I would hope that would benefit us greatly. Well, I guess I am going to have to ask you to be more specific. I mean the company doesn't lack capital. I mean if we had -- I lack currently opportunities to allocate capital. We have a ton of debt capacity if we could find say it $0.5 billion of things to buy, above what we could sell. We could easily issue debt to do that in which we are very comfortable doing so. So I don't need anybody else's capital. And I feel on that at least in the way you said it. We like joint ventures, we have a couple. We do more, if they made sense in some way. Maybe it's a risk diversification play, maybe it's because the PE firm has an opportunity lined up, they can execute on operationally. But I don't know that our PE firm would help us for example, validate the value of the company. I think people know what the company's worth, I think folks just think that the next couple of quarters we'll be tough. And so that's what the stock price is reacting to. I'm not sure, I feel like there's a lot of folks that are confused about the platforms long-term value. Thank you. Yeah. And I'll just add and this is just anecdotal. There are a lot of folks that as the summer wanes is going to want to be back in their normal routine. It's certainly not a bad thing especially when cities are this deactivated to maybe be it some other remote location for those who can't afford are able to do so. But it is a good number of people and I can tell you test to a 20 year old who is in my house, who is very anxious to get out of mom and dad's house and go back to her life in one of the big cities. So, I think that we're also going to see almost no matter whether the employers want it or not a stream of people that are our kind of residents slowly deciding that they've had enough of where they are and they are interested in again trying to be in a little bit more activated environment to potentially see a little bit more of the city that they move to for a reason. So, again I can't predict maybe the pandemic gets worse and that slows down again. But we've had pretty steady demand and I think Michael and I are of the general opinion without certainty being associated with it that the leasing season we'll extend itself. But it won't necessarily be vigorous going into the Q3 early Q4 period. Thank you. Yeah. I - Rich, we're open to buying urban or suburban. We talked about selling Manhan and we buy Manhan. We bought two assets in the suburbs in New Jersey and it just got to make sense. I mean it may have to make sense two ways the property has to make sense, the underwriting of the actual asset and I have to make sense in terms of our total exposure. If there is any small regret we have is just in some submarkets like the Upper West Side in New York, we just had a lot of units. We like New York we did need them all to be in one little area. So we're just trying to spread out a little. And that's been sort of the theme of the last few years is being in our markets but being spread out a little more. So there was an urban asset that underwrote, we wouldn't hesitate to purchase it. It just has to make sense relative to our allocation in that submarket already. I was hoping that we would grow and that the urban wouldn't shrink as much as the suburban would grow. But I would think, we'll get rid of a few urban assets here. And there are some older suburban stuff. In fact this quarter both the assets we sold were suburban properties. They were older 50 plus year old suburban assets that where renovation place, but weren't -- from our perspective ones that we wanted to undertake. Thank you. All right. Well, in terms of what other folks are underwriting, I would say the first question I had for the Chief Investment Officer over the course of the quarter was are we seeing more from brokers, is there actually shadow stuff going on? And the answer is a very little going on right now. So there doesn't seem to be like there's this pent up desire to sell assets in the apartment business and not a whole bunch of stuff that the brokers are looking at and hoping to get out soon of the marketplace. So I don't know if I have any insight into how other people are underwriting except that when we talked to private equity sponsors and other private real estate investors they continue to be very interested in the space. That whatever turbulence we have right now is not just persuading them from long-term interest in our space. So I think that's good. In terms of hazarding a guess on New York that requires a couple of things, I mean next year you're going to be pretty aggressive on real estate tax appeals in New York because taxes in New York for properties are in part based on their incomes and certainly we're going to all have different incomes than we had hoped for, for 2020, and we'll be looking like we did in the Great Recession for relief and we obtained that relief in our markets and we would hope to do that again. I'm not sure that's going to change 2021. There's a certain trajectory and your question implied it. These quarters, because of the rent roll is deteriorating, the quarters will keep getting worse for a while. And then that sort of rate of change on some of these new lease and renewal numbers will change. And then, the whole thing will turn around, and that just takes time. So, I really can't hazard a guess on when New York changes, especially when you talk about NOI, because that implicates for New York property taxes. So, in New York, it's very hard for me to think about how that might, but I would hope that they would be less of an increase or a little bit of a decrease in 2021. Thank you. So, it's Mark. I guess I like having a variety of these. I mean I think studios have an advantage of being the lowest price ticket. So, the pandemic, again, feels like it's gone on forever and will continue at some point it won't. And then people who are new to a market and new to their job and maybe working their way up as a professional, will look to a studio as a great way to get on trend in the big cities. So, I'm happy to own a little bit of a variety of these products. I wouldn't want to own all two's, all one-bedroom, all of anything. And so we've tried to be thoughtful about low ticket. So we do have a good number of studios and one-bedrooms in the markets. But, we do have plenty of twos and a few threes. These large unit types are hard for us to clear. I'll tell you consistently. We have a harder time renting three and four-bedroom units in our buildings, and they tend to be competing against luxury product and condos and stuff. So, I think studios ones and twos are where it's at for us and I'd like a nice mix of that notwithstanding your comment. And I would point out I mean Gen Z is a very large group as well, and we don't know their preferences, but I have a few of them living with me, and they talk a lot about both moving out to my house and moving to a city. Thank you. So your request is to see renewal rates by market net of renewal concessions? Sure. Yeah. I mean we're still working through things with our retail tenants. We're hopeful we're able to save a few of those folks as the city try to reopen. But one of the conversations we've had as a group several times now is in properties, and this alluded to the question Michael just addressed a moment ago. In these markets where we do have buildings that have studio apartments, could we repurpose of the retail as office space for those studio folks. As amenity space they could go to, a lounge of sorts, is that something that would be useful, you would need to put a lot of TI in that, that's just some lounge furniture and really good Internet connection. And again, not office space for the general public. But could you get a change of use in that retail and that would likely require rezoning and so it's kind of easier said than done. But that is intriguing to me, as you see retail footprint shrink in general. The idea of having unslightly vacant retail isn't very appealing. And the idea of taking on additional retail risk isn't that exciting. So maybe there is an opportunity here to be at service to our existing residents, put our square footage to use. So that's one of the ideas we've been kicking around. Thank you. Yeah. I'd start by saying, for example, in New York City, only 10% of our residents have children. So notwithstanding the age list you had, we also have people in their 20's who are earning a good living, or people in our one-bedrooms who are two people, right, they're a couple of living there. So, I guess, that's certainly a theory, but it's not anything we've sort of seen. I mean, these are really deep. When you look at the number of people in these markets making over $100,000 or $150,000 that's one the thing that's really exciting about our markets. This is a really big group of people. When you go to some of the smaller markets, you have a good growth of that number of high earners as renters. But it's just a small absolute number, Alex, and I worry that most of those folks are going to buy homes anyway. So, I guess, I'd tell you, I appreciate the theory, I've not seen any evidence of it. And our demographic doesn't tend to be like seemingly that anxious to buy a home. I mean, we are seeing a little in New York, as Michael said, folks moving out of New York City and out of New York proper. But they're mostly moving in New Jersey and I wonder if, when they get the all clear sign, some of them don't go back to Manhattan. So I just -- I'm not as convinced as you are that this is some sort of permanent change the pandemic has brought. I think the pandemic has put a lot of people on their heels about living in an urban environment right at the moment, especially in the summer. And I think people will constantly reappraise that decision. I mean, I lived in a city for a reason before. Yeah it's a good question. I put aside the party labels and the rest and just speak to policy. I mean, I do think that additional regulatory burdens and are a fair number of those that are being added in our markets, some of them related to this valid COVID emergency and some of us -- some of them seem almost opportunistic by activist groups to me. These are just going to restrict the amount of investment in housing. And that's the message we're trying to get across, as these limits you're putting in place, which kind of feel emotionally good to some folks, are just not going to work, that they're going to end up with housing at substandard, there is going to be less build, that it's all bad. And some of these ideas, again, and I think it's in the house package, so I believe it's a democrat idea, is to give the state money in bulk grants for the states to pass out directly to landlords or folks that are under stress from COVID. So, again, I don't know what will end up in the final package, but I think the idea of upholding the system and encouraging it to produce additional units. So I'd say what the industry is doing right now, is trying to do a little bit of an education campaign to have conversations with people about what's effective regulation and what isn't. And then, trying to help think that through. Could there be some zoning reform? Could there be more affordable units built with market rate? Could we address it that way, as oppose to these sort of rent regulation, some of the other stuff that folks have floated, that economists universally say, it's going to end up creating more problems than solutions for sure. Thank you, Alex. We thank you all for your time on the call and have a good rest of the summer. Good day."

            "name": "Bob Garechana",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today I will make a couple of brief remarks on same-store expenses, delinquency and bad debt, and conclude with the balance sheet. Same-store expenses declined for the quarter relative to prior year, driven by the advancements in our technology initiatives that Michael mentioned and delay or deferral of certain expenses largely stemming from the pandemic. Page 16 of the release provides detailed color on specific line items. I do want to highlight that expenses in the quarter included approximately $1 million related to one-time bonuses for our frontline workers and another $500,000 from elevated cleaning and other health and safety costs. As evidenced by our strong 97% collection rate for the quarter, our high-quality resident continues to pay their rent. That said, the combination of the small percentage of our residents that have been financially impacted by the pandemic and our conservative accounting policy has led to elevated residential bad debt in the quarter. Residential bad debt reduced revenue growth by approximately $9 million or 150 basis points in the same-store portfolio. That is about 100 basis points higher than the comparable period in 2019, which would have been a more typical level. For the next quarter or so, economic and regulatory uncertainties may lead to continued elevated bad debt. Turning to our non-residential business. I would remind you that the non-residential business is a small part of our overall operations at approximately 4% of revenues historically. But it is likely to have a disproportionate impact on total same store performance for the next few quarters. Retail tenant collections were about 60% for the quarter with collections trending slightly higher in June. Uncollected amounts that were deferred were almost entirely reserved against during the quarter from the financial statement standpoint. About two-thirds of the decline in non-residential revenues quarter-over-quarter stemmed from these reserves and other bad debt related items. Much like in residential, we have applied a relatively conservative accounting policy. This business is likely to continue to face challenges and we expect that the third quarter could be even tougher given likely delays in reopening activity and the potential lack of additional government small business stimulus. If retail performance continues to be stressed, we expect that a significant portion of the straight line non-residential receivable disclosed on page 11 could be at risk and therefore could be written-off. Finally a quick highlight on our fortress-like balance sheet. We enter the pandemic from a position of strength and have further enhanced our position through thoughtful refinancing activity and incremental debt reduction from disposition proceeds. By taking these steps, we have ensured sufficient liquidity and incremental debt capacity for any opportunities that may present themselves. We have limited near-term maturities, modest development spend and incredible access to capital. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Yeah. Hey, John, it's Bob. So for economic occupancy in Los Angeles, specifically and I'm going to give you the quarter numbers so Q2 of 2020, we're at 93.7% that's compared to 94.7% physical occupancy. So about 100 basis point delta. You're correct that Los Angeles is where we've seen the higher delinquency pattern and that corresponded to the higher bad debt write-off. And while we're at it, if you want, I thought I also might talk a little bit about because I know in different notes. We've seen kind of comparability related to both kind of concessions, accounting for concessions and bad debt as well if that makes sense, John to kind of maybe walk the group through that. When looking at bad debt because I think there is some comparability concerns or issues I think it's important that we first kind of take our approach and understand what our policy is so I wanted to take the opportunity to explain that. On the residential side, we continue to apply the same policy we've applied for many years and our policy is as follows; we write-off all of our former resident account balances once they move out. So if you vacated the unit we write it off, a 100% of anything that you owed us and those accounts convert to a cash basis. For residents that continue to occupy the units but still owe us money, we write-off a 100% of their account balance once they reach three times their monthly rent. So from that point forward we convert to a cash basis. So we think that's helpful to understand, we also think it's helpful to understand what the net receivable balance is as of the end of the quarter which we provided in the release. For residential, our net receivable balance before security deposits was about $11.7 million and after security deposit it's about $9 million or a 150 basis points of quarterly revenues. And so in the second quarter, same store reported revenue growth, which I talked about in my prepared remarks, was reduced by about one percentage point overall consistent with this policy. Going into the third quarter, we expect that the bad debt will remain elevated as I mentioned in our residential business. But if collection rates remain the same and consistent, the impact shouldn't be hugely different than the second quarter impact. We continue to be remaining \u2013 we continue to remain diligent on writing off those delinquent accounts. Now non-residential a little bit of a different story and it's more of a tenant-by-tenant analysis. So we continue to account for that on accrual basis but this quarter as you've heard me talk about it, we reserved against pretty much all of the unpaid rent. So effectively converting it to a cash basis and we also wrote-off a portion of the straight line receivable. We continue to monitor that straight line as I mentioned and that's consistent \u2013 that's really more a function of the future prospects of those tenants. And we have a number of those on a watch list and depending on future conditions that could write-off that could result in future write-off. So I thought that be a helpful kind of summary on bad debt because I know as you guys work through the earnings season, you're going to see a difference in kind of how people think about bad debt et cetera. And then finally kind of the other comparability item you might take note on is just concessions. So I wanted to be completely clear that in our same store reported numbers we report in line with GAAP. So what that means is that we run the straight line concession through the reported revenue numbers. And we've done that for a number of years after a general SEC publication, on kind of non-GAAP metrics and encouraging companies to do so. But I'm happy to give you kind of the cash basis numbers by market or in aggregate like I mentioned earlier. So it was a 120 basis points, so we -- so for a residential only, we reported in the second quarter, a 90 basis point decline. If that was on a cash basis, it would have been 120 basis points. If you go to market-by-market that relationship so it be would be a that relationship of being call it 30 basis points down, it's pretty consistent overall. But I'm happy to kind of give you guys those numbers by market. So Boston would have been a negative 1.7%, New York would have been a negative 1.9%, D.C would have been flat, Seattle would have been 1.5%, San Francisco would have been negative 1.4%, L.A. would have been negative 2%, Orange County would have been 90 basis points positive. And San Diego would have been flat. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color in the call, a little bit of color on comparability items. Great. Yeah, that's correct. And I would add that the bad debt reserve isn't just the allowance for doubtful accounts. It's also the write-off of any resident who would have moved out during that period as well. Correct. Yeah. Well I guess I'll point out. So first and foremost, the 20% that I cited that was receiving some form of increase for July and August. Those are residents that are actually kind of below streets today. So that's why those increases are going out. And the willingness to negotiate I mean that is part of our renewal process and we're going to make sure that we are always being cognizant of what that replacement rent is going to be. And as we're working through these negotiations I mean we go back to the fact that listen the largest thing that people want to avoid is moving. The number one reason they tell us they just don't want to move so they want to work with us. Great. I'll start on the dollar piece and I'm going to have to take you back a few months before COVID to give you a good frame of reference to be honest with you, I think to give some color. But we had excellent expense control in the second quarter and as I kind of mentioned in my remarks, a lot of that came from the initiatives that Michael talked about. So it is the ability on our frontline, kind of, leasing and admin and other things to convert to a more digital platform to do virtual tours to be more efficient to understand our employee utilization et cetera, and that certainly helped in us achieving our goals in terms of our on-site payroll, reductions right via attritions. So that was incredibly helpful. We also in R&M experience benefits through the deployment of our mobility for our service personnel and our ability to use them as well. And so that impacts the payroll line and the R&M line, because it helps your decision making in terms of staffing. So you can staff internally as opposed to using contractors et cetera. What gets a little bit tough right is that there were other things going on related to COVID in the quarter. And so there were some deferral of expenses and some incremental expenses that I mentioned in both of those categories. But overall I think from a sustainability standpoint. we're running call it 50 to 75 basis points ahead or lower in expense growth than what we would have thought at the beginning of the year before COVID ever occurred. And that's a real positive and it's really those two items that I was talking about. So we haven't changed the definition. We've always given renewal rate growth excluding concessions, and we also have given new lease excluding concessions as well. What we gave you instead to gave you a concept. And in the past, to be honest with you, the concessions were selling immaterial that, neither one of those numbers or the blended rate would have been any different. What we gave you in addition this quarter is we gave you the effective blended lease rate, which is with the impact of the concessions. So you can see the blended impact with and without concessions. The blended rate. We'll take that. We can take that."

At this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.\nMarty McKenna: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I want to begin today by giving a big thank you to my Equity Residential colleagues for their dedication to serving our 150,000 residents during this difficult time. Whether working on-site performing essential maintenance or concierge duties, whether you\u2019re engaging remotely with prospects using our new touchless leasing process, or whether you are working from home in the many corporate roles that make Equity Residential hum, you are keeping our company rolling. So thank you very much Equity Nation for your amazing work. Now turning to our business. The best way I can describe it in the last seven weeks is resilient. In April, we collected in our residential business about 97% of the cash that we would usually collect. While no part of our country\u2019s economy will be immune from the coming recession, we feel that our portfolio of properties, populated with residents having average annual household incomes of $164,000 and often employed in technology and other knowledge industries, will fare relatively well. Our operations team has also shown resiliency. When the pandemic hit in full force in mid-March, Michael Manelis and his team quickly pivoted, and over a few week period, adjusted our leasing and service operations dramatically. On the leasing side, Michael and his team were able to quickly create a touchless process that made our customers comfortable to lease. And on the service side, we focused on essential maintenance tasks and cleanliness, which helped our existing residents feel safe and comfortable living with us through this pandemic. Michael will give you more details about all of this in a minute. When the lockdowns were initially announced, we saw our leasing activity decline significantly, but demand has since picked up, as we noted in the release. We see our recent pickup in demand as a further indication that our properties and markets will remain attractive places to live for our target demographic. All in all, we think our people and our properties have been resilient, with the capital R going through this crisis. We do fully acknowledge that challenging days remain ahead and are taking steps to weather the storm and prepare for the post-pandemic world. We have further fortified our already strong balance sheet, as Bob Garechana will describe in a moment. We are also preparing in earnest for our properties to operate with fuller staffing as lockdowns across the country are relaxed. We will keep in mind the safety of our employees and residents as we reengineer our business. Equity Residential has historically performed well in these downturns, and we would expect this to be no exception. We are optimistic that we will perform well operationally given these circumstances and that we will find opportunities to add high-quality assets for our platform as the economy works its way through this recession. Finally, we did withdraw guidance in the release. We are unable to estimate with precision the continuing impact of the pandemic and the timing and character of the reopening process on our business. It makes it impossible for us to give you the high-quality estimates of where our business might go in the near-term that you\u2019re used to receiving. We did provide a significant amount of information on April\u2019s preliminary results and hope that is helpful. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark. So today, I\u2019m going to provide a quick recap of operations over the past 45 days. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were off to a very good start for the year. Our occupancy was ahead of expectations, and we were well positioned for the primary leasing season. And then COVID-19 hit, causing us to adjust our operations to this new unprecedented challenge. Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees during these unprecedented times. They inspire me with their ability to quickly adjust operations while keeping an intense focus on our customers, properties, themselves and their families. Shelter-in-place was mandated by governors in our markets in early to mid-March. For us, this means that our more than 150,000 residents began staying at home 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In response to shelter-in-place, we made some key changes to our operations. We closed our common area amenities, we increased cleaning frequency, we quickly modified our website and our artificial intelligent E-Lead responses to pivot the entire sales process to virtual leasing. Capturing video content and conducting the sales process via video conversations allowed the business to continue uninterrupted. This process would have normally taken us several months to accomplish. We also locked the office doors to encourage social distancing but kept the business running as we implemented shift rotations of the staff to reduce the number of employees coming to the property. When we look back to March 15, we saw our traffic and applications drop 50% compared to the same period in 2019. That being said, we continued to receive over 375 new applications each week through the end of March, which we see as a validation of the new leasing process. With reduced traffic coming through the front door, our focus has been on keeping current residents in place. We are currently offering residents the option to renew without increase. Overall, retention in April and May has improved as we are now renewing in the mid to upper 60% range, which is a 300 basis point improvement from last April and an almost 800 basis point improvement from last May. New York is having the strongest renewal percents of nearly 70% for March, April and May. Despite this good retention, our overall occupancy since March 31 has declined by 130 basis points. We expect the occupancy impact to be the most pronounced in the second quarter, setting a new base from which we hope it will improve as shelter-in-place orders are lifted. Let me share some color on the performance in April. At the beginning of April, we began to notice an improvement in demand, with both traffic and leasing activity rebounding by almost 30% and actually now trending on par with last year. In fact, we had over 900 applications last week, which is a significant improvement compared to the 375 that we were averaging in late March and very encouraging for us. Given the activity in the last 45 days, we would like to see that volume grow even more to help offset the lower demand that we experienced in March and to match the increased volume of applications that we usually get in May. What is clear is that our high-quality, well-located portfolio continues to attract future residents. While the pandemic is certainly a deterrent, people have life reasons that require them to move like changes in jobs or partners. On Page 13, we reported the first quarter and included April monthly pricing statistics by market. I would remind everybody this is only one month of data, and that longer periods of time are usually required to show definitive trends. Mark mentioned the strength and quality of our resident base. This is evident by the fact that we received a very strong 97% of the cash collections in April relative to our March collections. This resilience delivered 5.4% delinquency, which is quite good given these unprecedented circumstances. Notably, Seattle and Denver were our markets with the lowest delinquency at below 3% and Los Angeles was the laggard close to 8%. The rest of our markets were centered around the average. We have also taken a cut at looking at property type. And in most of our markets, our garden-style or more suburban assets have experienced higher delinquency than our mid-rise, high-rise more urban locations. As we move through the continued disruptions created by COVID-19, we remain strategic in our pricing efforts. Sitting here today, our base rents are down 4% compared to the same week last year. Let me give you some color on notable markets. Overall, our strongest market is Seattle, which has shown great resilience, with limited delinquency and the best overall revenue growth performance in the portfolio. New York is a bit of a mixed story. On one hand, it has the strongest retention of any market, but it has also not shown the signs of recovery that other markets have with traffic and applications. Long-term, we expect the New York market to benefit from low new supply and technology firms expanding their presence in the city. We are hoping leasing activity will improve as the hard-hit New York area gets through the worst of the pandemic. Finally, we started 2020 anticipating that Los Angeles would have a very challenging year given the new supply pressure. COVID will definitely add to this. Despite recent improvements in applications, we expect this market to remain challenged with meaningful pricing pressure that will continue as supply is delivered. So where do we go from here? Well, we\u2019re now in the early stages of preparing our properties for the new normal. We expect things to shift over time. Right now, the new normal is going to be focused on increased deep cleaning standards at the properties; adjustments to the layout of common areas, including fitness and lounges to accommodate social distancing; balancing the capabilities of virtual leasing with the need to engage with our customers; and ultimately, staggering work shifts to ensure that we limit the number of employees on-site at any given time. These are challenging times, but our business is resilient, and our teams are positioned to deliver. Thank you. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Garechana: Thanks, Michael. This morning, I\u2019ll highlight our enhanced disclosure from last night\u2019s release, give a brief update on non-residential operations and end with our incredibly well-positioned balance sheet. Starting with our new disclosures. We\u2019ve modified our disclosures to help better present our business and where it stands today. We do so by providing April operational and collection statistics, by breaking out our same-store performance between residential and non-residential, a practice that we would expect to continue as the performance from our main residential business, which makes up approximately 96% of total revenues, is likely to diverge meaningfully in the upcoming quarters for our much smaller non-residential business. This includes modifying the schedules on Pages 10 through 12 of the release. And finally, by providing an update on liquidity and balance sheet information. In order to accomplish this, we\u2019ve defined a number of key terms in the back of the release. We hope that these definitions will provide specificity and clarity to our disclosure. Part of the new disclosure includes a breakout of non-residential operations for our same-store portfolio. This is a modest component of our business at 4% of total revenues and consists mostly of ground floor retail and public non-resident parking at our well-located apartment communities. Ground floor retail makes up about two-thirds of this 4% with public non-resident parking making up the rest. As you would suspect, a good portion of the retail tenants that rent our space have been significantly impacted by shelter-in-place orders. This is evidenced by the 58% April collection rate for all retail that we disclosed, which, while certainly below what we would have hoped, may be higher than many other retail landlords. The drugstores, bank branches and national chains that occupy a good portion of these spaces have, for the most part, continued to pay rent, while local small business owners have struggled. With non-resident parking, we\u2019ve seen an approximately 30% decline in parking volume for April, given the lack of public events and increased work-from-home arrangements. We suspect that this may recover as shelter-at-home orders are eventually lifted. Finally, a few highlights on our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with an incredibly strong net debt to normalized EBITDA of 4.9 times and nearly $1.8 billion in liquidity under our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we improved this already strong position by closing on a very attractively priced 2.6% or $195 million 10-year GSE loan and by closing on the sale of an asset in the San Francisco Bay Area. With these steps, we sit here today with over 84% of our total NOI unencumbered, about $150 million in commercial paper outstanding and readily available liquidity of over $2.2 billion under our revolving credit facility, which does not mature until 2024. This liquidity is more than sufficient to address our modest level of anticipated development spend, minimal debt maturities in 2020 and to address our next significant debt maturity, which isn\u2019t until December of 2021. Our balance sheet is in excellent condition to weather the storm and take advantage of opportunities should they present themselves. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to the operator.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll start with Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. I hope you guys are doing well. Just \u2013 first on May rent collections, I recognize we\u2019re still very early in the month, but I\u2019m wondering how collections have been thus far? And maybe you can tie it to where you were in March or this time last year.\nMichael Manelis: So this is Michael. I guess I would just say, so first and foremost, yes, you\u2019re right. This is very early in the month. But right now, looking at kind of how we closed out yesterday, we are identical, like right on par to the way collections kind of played out through the month of April.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And if you think about the delinquency moving up at the end of April, and I recognize there\u2019s always some level of delinquency, it was helpful to put in the March number two. But how do you think about the ability to collect on that rent? And then how are you working with the residents to get repaid?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll start, and then Bob can kind of fill in. So first and foremost, I mean, I think you can see from the release, we\u2019re dealing with about $11 million in total delinquency, and that was above the $5.4 million that we had in the previous month. So the process that we\u2019re going through right now is we\u2019re working through conversations with all of these residents, with both kind of an empathetic mindset as well as an obligation kind of reminder mindset. And that\u2019s a tough balance that our teams are doing, but we\u2019re setting up various payment plans in places, and we\u2019re just documenting kind of the financial hardships that many of our residents have experienced from this. And we\u2019ll be navigating and working through those conversations through the month of May, just like we did in the month of April.\nNick Joseph: But how much of that is like building in? And maybe just to frame, it sounds like the 260 basis points from March was totally in line with the historical nature of where you are on a monthly basis in terms of collections, which obviously accelerated in April given the hardships that a lot of individuals are going through. Is there anything in that increased delinquency bucket that is either geography-based, asset type-based? Is there any color that you can give in terms of that amount? And have you already entered into any sort of deferrals on that amount or outside of the collections that you\u2019ve had?\nMichael Manelis: So I think, first, in the prepared remarks, I kind of identified, right? Seattle and Denver were absolutely the lowest at 3% or below total delinquency. L.A. was the highest at 8%. As far as property types, we definitely saw kind of lower delinquency at the high-rise, kind of mid-rise product versus kind of the more suburban or garden-style. So I think right now, in regard to deferred rent, I mean, the nature of these conversations are all over the place. I mean these are very one-on-one conversations that we\u2019re having. But much of that delinquency or at least the incremental delinquency from hardships is set up in payment plans or set up into deferred rent situations. And I think the varying state of emergency orders that we have around the country are going to dictate when those payment plans are going to allow for payments to reoccur.\nMark Parrell: And I just want to add, Nick, it\u2019s Mark. As you think about building delinquency going forward, you also have to think a little bit, we do have significant security deposits that we haven\u2019t applied in any of these analyses. So generally speaking, you take the security deposit when the resident moves out, but that\u2019s a matter of local law. So we do have a significant amount of security deposits against these obligations. Michael has entered into a bunch of payment plans that the company has, and there\u2019ll be more of those. So I don\u2019t disagree that the economy will get worse before it gets better. But I\u2019d also say we do have these other offsets, both on the security deposit side and with these payment plans, and we\u2019ll just have to feel our way through it.\nNick Joseph: Right. And your April, that \u2013 with the April numbers that you\u2019re quoting, would you \u2013 outside of that 5-point \u2013 $11 million would you have already deferred a certain amount of your monthly rent that was already due? So effectively, there is more sort of delay in cash collections even outside of the $11 million?\nBob Garechana: Yes. It\u2019s Bob. And I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color to that. So if you think about March and kind of the regular or the pre-COVID delinquency levels, it\u2019s very uncommon or would have been very uncommon to have any level of deferral of rental payments. Typically, you would have ended a month at 2% to 3% of delinquency and then through the regular process of having conversations and collecting that rent, et cetera, that would have diminished to the point in time where it converted to a financial statement impact, which would have been write-offs of bad debt, et cetera. And that number would have been something more like 50 basis points of, call it, total income. So very uncommon in this business to have a material amount of delinquency or payment plans, if you will. Obviously, the situation has changed modestly with the COVID-19 and pandemic implications.\nMichael Manelis: And Nick, I want to answer just precisely, delinquency includes everything, including the payment plan. So that number is all-inclusive as it relates to the residential book. There isn\u2019t \u2013 like, if it\u2019s a payment plan, it isn\u2019t suddenly undelinquent. It remains in our books to link. We just aren\u2019t pursuing the resident, we have a deal with them, but we don\u2019t \u2013 we include that in our number.\nNick Joseph: Perfect. Thank you.\nMichael Manelis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead.\nRob Stevenson: Can you guys talk about what level of extra operating expenses you\u2019re incurring from COVID? And how much of that has been offset by reduced hours for employees and other areas?\nMichael Manelis: Sure. So maybe \u2013 this is Michael. I\u2019ll start off. I guess I would tell you, to date, we probably have incurred about $0.5 million of expense specific to COVID, and that would include kind of not only the increased cleaning standards that are occurring at our properties, but also some of the personal protection equipment that we\u2019ve been acquiring. And I think some of the offset has been, obviously, we we\u2019re incurring less overtime expense on our payroll. We\u2019re experiencing less turnover expense. But then on the flip side, having all these residents living with us, we\u2019re also having some increased trash expense that\u2019s mitigating some of those offsets.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And if things begin to spool back up in some markets, how much of that do you expect of the expense side to be sticky? And how much of the offsets do you lose as the hours for employees tick back up and other things? I assume that the trash doesn\u2019t go down anytime soon, et cetera.\nMichael Manelis: Yes, so I mean, I think we\u2019re looking at kind of what it looks like to kind of reopen and what that new normal is going to look and feel like. I think it is clear to expect that we are going to be spending more money on cleaning standards and protocols at our properties. But I think that we\u2019re going to be balancing kind of that out, not only kind of with the labor and the overtime, but trying to figure out more things that we\u2019re going to get done in-house versus relying on contract labor.\nMark Parrell: And I\u2019ll just add, I mean, if we\u2019re \u2013 again, we did withdraw guidance. So I know you\u2019re trying to feel your way through that, so we\u2019ll give you a few other building blocks. Our general instinct here is that our expense numbers will be lower this year than we thought, not higher. So these cleanliness and other costs aren\u2019t zero, but they\u2019re not that significant. And the overtime, the less routine maintenance that\u2019s being done because things are being deferred, all of that is more material. And so over time, again, you could have certain events occur in markets, weather-related or otherwise. But absent that, our general sense is that the expenses will remain pretty tight and this is not going to blow a hole in the expense number for us.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then on the capital side, I mean, how \u2013 I assume that all the dispositions completed year-to-date were under contract before COVID hit. Can you just talk about \u2013 I mean, if you wanted to sell assets today, is there enough demand in pricing to be able \u2013 is that market back to being liquid or people taking a pause there? How are you guys thinking about potentially making acquisitions going forward and also redevelopment spend over the next quarter or two?\nMark Parrell: Yes. There isn\u2019t a lot going on right now. I mean, the last seven weeks with the pandemic, again, talking to the brokers, talking to potential sellers, there really isn\u2019t anything institutional grade in our markets that\u2019s priced and closed or is even very far along in that process. So I don\u2019t have any markers there. As you relate to EQR, I mean we\u2019re always out there. We have teams in our markets, and it\u2019s their job to always be looking at purchase opportunities and such. But right now, there\u2019s just not a lot going on.\nRob Stevenson: And on redevelopment, are you going to be able to get the returns to warrant the spending in the near-term? Or do you guys put a pause on that for now?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Great question. We have a pause on it, but for a little different reason. Our residents don\u2019t really want contractors in the building, our contractors don\u2019t really want to go out right now with the shelter-in-place. So what you\u2019re going to see across our portfolio is a real slowdown in capital spending, including renovation. These projects that we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, we hope to begin those again. We\u2019ll be thoughtful about whether we can get the rents and all of that. But at this point, really, a lot of this capital spending depends on having people on-site. Those people aren\u2019t willing to come. And frankly, our residents are more comfortable with them not being there, so I think there\u2019s going to be a real slowdown there.\nRob Stevenson: How significant have been any of the delays in the development pipeline for those few assets?\nMark Parrell: Yes. That\u2019s a great question. It depends on where you are, so I\u2019ll start by saying that. So for example, in Boston, where we\u2019ve got a tower we\u2019re building, the mayor closed construction March 17, and it still hasn\u2019t reopened, and that\u2019s the sort of city of Boston Rule. But outside the City of Boston in some of the suburbs, construction continues. So it\u2019s really place by place across the country. And I\u2019d say there\u2019s more significant delays in places like Boston and New York in terms of places we do business and to a good extent, Seattle. There\u2019s less of a delay in D.C. and Southern California, where things have just kind of continued. And the delays you\u2019ll see in those places are people working in shifts. General contractors saying, you need to split your shifts up, we need more physical distance between workers. And so you\u2019ll see things slow down a little bit because of that. For example, when you look at our numbers and Axio\u2019s numbers for supply, shifting like what happened between our opinion at the end of 2019 and at the end of the first quarter of 2020 as to what 2020 supply would be, and in markets like Boston and New York, those numbers, we think, are going to move down, supply being lower in 2020 by upwards of 20%. In places like Southern California, it\u2019s more nominal, and the same with D.C. So it\u2019s very much a local law thing.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. So appreciate the April data you gave on renewals, new leases in terms of rate growth. I guess from a timing standpoint, I want to be clear on this because I think it can be confusing at times. If you guys reported renewal rates achieved 2.8% in April, you\u2019re saying that \u2013 I think you said that you\u2019re offering zero renewals, flat renewals across the portfolio now. At what point in the year does that sort of 0% renewal rate growth get kind of fully factored into your rent roll?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So this is Michael. So I think first and foremost, you got to realize the April numbers that we reported on renewals, many of those offers were generated in January and February. So many of those leases were already executed well before kind of COVID-19 pandemic began. When we started issuing those offers in mid to late March, those are really for kind of May, June and now even July offers that are out there. So I think what you could expect to see is May is going to trend down, probably be somewhere between 50 to 100 basis points positive. And then in June is when I would expect that you\u2019ll start to see us kind of deliver flat on the renewal increase percent.\nMark Parrell: And just to add a little to that, we will start to adjust our renewal expectations, our asks, and we\u2019ll try and look at the market and see what we can get done. So as conditions start to normalize, we\u2019ll sort of feel our way through supply and demand conditions, and you will see us increase our renewal asks, I would expect mid to later in the year. Right now, we\u2019re making decisions in some markets as far out as August. So we\u2019ve got to call that Nick, at some point, and make a judgment.\nNick Yulico: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess also on the new lease change side, if we look at the April numbers, I don\u2019t know if you have any data you could share on May so far. But I mean, April seems like it\u2019s unusual month, right? You didn\u2019t have as much traffic. So if we\u2019re looking at down almost 2% on new lease growth in April, I guess May shaping out to be a similar number, maybe you could just talk about how we should think about that new lease growth impact.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Well, I think in the prepared remarks, I kind of stated that base rents or amenitized rents right now are down about 4% compared to the same week last year. So as you kind of just fast-forward your way through May, you could expect that, that new lease change could deteriorate down to that 4%. But again, the numbers that you\u2019re looking on that release, if you go to the footnote of that, you\u2019ll see that the 12 to 12 are the like term actually improves by about 110 basis points, so it\u2019s actually down negative 80 basis points. So I don\u2019t know exactly where we\u2019ll land because, again, this is kind of a lease-by-lease thing that you work through to see these stats, which is why I always caution everybody from looking at just one month. But I think I\u2019d like to just understand where are my amenitized or asking rents relative to last year, and that\u2019s that kind of down 4% level.\nMark Parrell: And I\u2019m just going to take a chance, Nick, to add a little bit to that answer. And that\u2019s we feel and we gave some extra disclosure about, at the moment, demand conditions. We like, on the occupancy side, the momentum we feel like we will pick up. It\u2019s certain \u2013 it\u2019s not certain. We have to see how these unwinds and these various stay-at-home orders go, but we would expect our occupancy to recover. And we feel good about that. And then you have, as Michael said, with the recession, and that will affect new lease and renewal and all the other quotes. But on the occupancy side, I think we\u2019ve shown we\u2019re already having days where we have more move-ins than move-outs. We\u2019re already seeing all that occupancy stuff kind of steady. So as we see these markets open up, our hope is that, again, if it\u2019s done in an orderly fashion, and we don\u2019t slide back into a lockdown again, that we\u2019ll work our way out of occupancy, and then there\u2019ll be just the rate stuff to deal with. So I just want to emphasize, we feel pretty good about demand. Even in the pandemic, we\u2019re seeing good demand for our product. It\u2019s just a matter of figuring out the clearing price at the moment.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Yes, that\u2019s helpful, Mark. I guess just one follow-up on occupancy. And I know you guys did talk about second quarter being the biggest occupancy impact in the portfolio. I mean, April versus March, you already lost 130 basis points of physical occupancy. I mean, is it \u2013 is that kind of the brunt of it? Is it going to get worse than that? I mean any idea on occupancy for the second quarter right now?\nMichael Manelis: Well. And I guess the way to think about is right now is that the fact if our applications like they are right now are on par with last year and my retention continues to improve, it\u2019s already improved. But if it continues to improve, I think you\u2019re going to see occupancy not only stabilized, but possibly start to improve. If our demand continues at this pace and our applications start running above last year with stronger retention, I think you\u2019re going to see this portfolio come back to that 96% level and start kind of optimizing revenue there. But I think it\u2019s still a little bit too early to understand because we really need some of these shelter in places to be lifted to truly understand the longer term kind of demand or impact on traffic for us to kind of optimize revenue offer.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And everything Michael said, absolutely agree with, but would add, we don\u2019t really understand the impact of the recession. I mean it is true that 20 million plus jobs are gone. It\u2019s hard for us to understand that impact on rate and on demand without all these stay at home orders being lifted and once that happens we\u2019ll have a better view for you. But yes, certainly our hope that given the strong demand we\u2019ve seen while we\u2019re still in the shutdown, that we have stemmed the sort of occupancy bleed for the most part. And then we\u2019re just going to have to all-figure out what rate is in a recession like this.\nNick Yulico: Yes. Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Rich Hightower from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRich Hightower: Hey, good morning guys. Hope all is well.\nMark Parrell: Hey, how are you?\nRich Hightower: Yes. Thank you. So just to follow up again on that occupancy question, just to clarify that, that 130 basis point month-over-month loss, were those move outs in April according to sort of normal lease expirations, was it COVID related? What was the sort of composition of the change exactly. If you don\u2019t mind adding a little more color there?\nMark Parrell: Yes, yes, no problem. So it\u2019s a little bit of both, right. So I think when March 15, kind of rolls around, everybody that was scheduled to move out for the balance of the year, for the balance of the month based on lease expirations moved out, people that were scheduled to move in, some of those folks canceled, kind of those move-ins are deferred those move-in. And then we had, call it a couple of hundred of our units basically COVID specific reason leave early, early terminations.\nRich Hightower: Okay.\nMark Parrell: That\u2019s really the impact on the occupancy.\nRich Hightower: Yes. Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. And then maybe, obviously tough to predict, but as you apply the experience from maybe 2008, 2009 and the possibility of sort of the trade down or the doubling up effect coming out of a recession, where do you guys, how do you think about your portfolio given it\u2019s predominant Class A white color composition, how do you think about that dynamic with respect to your own portfolio going forward here?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Hey Rich, it\u2019s Mark. I start by saying the portfolio is similar but not the same as 2008, 2009, I mean we have a higher-end clientele as you acknowledged in your question. I like the income levels, I like the kind of employment our residents have, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re immune to the recession that\u2019s coming, but I think there\u2019ll be less effective than some of the folks in hospitality and other industries got laid-off very quickly and suffered unfortunately very quickly in this recession. So I guess we feel now \u2013 I guess we do feel much better about our resident base. We think they\u2019ve both got skills that will mean they\u2019ll be more readily employable. I mean we worry, I think a little bit about portfolios that depend on workers that have been \u2013 often how many of those workers are really getting those jobs back. In our portfolio, we just don\u2019t see that as much at this point. As I mean a few people won\u2019t lose their jobs in our resident base, but we think being tied to technology and some of these knowledge industry jobs is going to mean that our folks will have more employability, less layoffs coming through this recession.\nRich Hightower: Okay. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to follow-up with some of the comments in terms of the occupancy floor and application volume picking back up. I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around what\u2019s the more important leading indicator for what this spring and summer leasing season? As the applications current being flat or traffic, being down 20% and Michael, what kind of weight do you put on traffic versus applications? Just trying to understand what\u2019s more important for us to focus on?\nMichael Manelis: Well, so I think the improvement in traffic is really telling, right compared to where we were even in the beginning of the month and where we are right now. And then our closing ratios is kind of giving us that sense of this market clearing price. And if I backed up all the way to March, I\u2019ll tell you, I mean we\u2019re looking at how many eyeballs were hitting the website, what was that traffic count looking like? And we were closing 70% to 80% of everybody who expressed interest, so it was not a price issue back then. And right now as you can see, okay, we have an opportunity to kind of make an impact with the traffic improvement that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re going to continue to do what we\u2019re doing with promotion base to go forward and try to recover some of what we gave back in the last 45 days. But I think it\u2019s really the improving trends is what you got to focus on. Because again, the peak leasing season is not going to exist like the peak leasing season has in the past. It\u2019s probably going to shift forward a few months or it may just be kind of more dulled throughout the whole thing. We don\u2019t know that yet. So what we\u2019re watching is week-over-week. Are we seeing the improving traffic? Are we seeing the improvement in apps like you would expect to see through a leasing season? And so far that\u2019s what\u2019s been playing out for the last several weeks for us.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Bob, on the delinquency side. Thanks for the comments on what\u2019s your typical delinquency rate and then as you work through the payments, what does it all come down to in terms of bad debt, 2% to 3% delinquency, eventually getting down to 50 bps. A market like LA, where there\u2019s an 8% delinquency rate and tenants have a year to pay back rent, with 8% delinquency rate, what\u2019s your reasonable bad debt working assumption for rent you\u2019ll never see?\nBob Garechana: I think that\u2019s a hard question to answer in all fairness. We haven\u2019t seen those kinds of levels historically, right. So like I said, this business was very fortunate and has been very fortunate to see very little delinquency historically. So I\u2019m not sure that ratio of that I talked about between 2% to 3% converting itself ultimately to 50 basis points necessarily holds true in the middle of a pandemic. I do think that all the positives that we have in our resident base that Mark outlined in terms of high-quality employment, et cetera, should help in the collections process, but hard to guess any answer to that one right now.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Is it fair to say you probably won\u2019t know until 2021 and we won\u2019t see it in the financials until 2021 the net shortfall?\nBob Garechana: Yes. I mean my \u2013 and that kind of gets towards the kind of bad debt expense policy or kind of what policy we have in terms of write-offs, et cetera. And I think that\u2019s something that in the second quarter we will evaluate with a lot more detail about at what point do you reserve against some of these outstanding deferral programs and payment programs, because certainly there will be some subset of residents that are subject to a payment program that ultimately don\u2019t pay. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re currently evaluating and currently discussing as we have just simply a lack of historical payment history to understand because of the unprecedented nature. So I think you\u2019re correct in assuming that, it\u2019ll \u2013 that is to be told as how it manifests itself in the financial statements.\nMichael Manelis: And again, just to add to that just a little bit, John, we have the security deposits that we need to apply against this amount. It\u2019s not appropriate to apply it against the delinquency. Now you usually by law do it when a resident moves out or near that time or with the residents agreements. So we do have a little bit of an offset there that we need to figure out, but there certainly be more delinquency. Bob, I think maybe you give a little color on what was delinquency in the great financial crisis.\nBob Garechana: Yes. Delinquency and I\u2019m sorry and bad debt expense. So I\u2019ll talk maybe the bad debt expense to give you a frame of reference. So I mentioned earlier that in normal kind of environment, so not in the great financial crisis, we run about 50 basis points of total. In 2009, which would have been the worst year of the great financial crisis that 50 basis points converted itself to slightly over 100 basis points.\nMichael Manelis: Is that helpful, John, giving you a little bit of a frame of reference?\nJohn Pawlowski: Yes, definitely. I know it\u2019s a guessing game right now, but there\u2019s more cities enact a longer payback periods, Seattle, yesterday coming out and saying you have till 2021 imagine more cities along the coast will do the same. Just trying to understand how those historical relationships change in this in this environment. Thank you.\nMichael Manelis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Good morning guys. I\u2019m looking at that 11 million delinquency, is that mostly tied to hardship in your opinion or is it more people electing not to pay rent in more tenant friendly government, which is a coast on the last question.\nMark Parrell: Wow. So just to make sure I understand your question Wes, is it mostly people have hardship issues that they can sort of document or is it folks that have just decided not to pay sort of the moral hazard issue? Is that the question?\nWes Golladay: There on.\nMark Parrell: Yes, I guess that\u2019s a little hard to tell for us. Some of the residents haven\u2019t called us back and we don\u2019t have insight into their thought process not paying us. But that\u2019s a very small number for us given again the quality of the portfolio. We\u2019re talking about a pretty small number of accounts here. So I guess I\u2019d say that most of the conversations that Michael has shared with me have been people saying, Hey, I need another week or two and then they pay it. So that\u2019s been most of the conversations that we\u2019ve had to-date. I\u2019d also point out that, there are people that may benefit from the checks that they\u2019ll receive from the government either through unemployment or through that federal supplementary payment. And I\u2019m not sure how quickly all those are reaching people either. And that could be a benefit to us as well. So I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have a breakdown or anything. We\u2019ve got a few people that have ghosted us, but that\u2019s a pretty small number. And really it\u2019s, most people have been talking to us. I mean, working something out. Again, it\u2019s not more payment plans, it\u2019s often just give me another couple of weeks and I\u2019ll pay you the rent. That\u2019s been a more predominant conversation.\nWes Golladay: Okay. I appreciate you holding rent renewals flat in every portfolio. But you did call out some of your markets are actually doing quite strong, Seattle tech workers in particular. Well, I guess would you phase-in renewals for different segments or is it going to be a blanket kind of special renewals for the whole portfolio? And how you approach that, I guess the increases going forward?\nMichael Manelis: Yes, so I think this is Michael again. So I think we\u2019re now looking at kind of months like August and September renewal offers. And I think, each market always was done strategically with different kinds of parameters being set for kind of how we would issue kind of renewal offers. So I would expect, that there will be markets that will maintain kind of a no increase option for and then there\u2019ll be markets that we start going back to kind of tiring approaches and see kind of what those results are.\nMark Parrell: And add to it isn\u2019t just markets, we priced by unit. So I mean in 2015 when things were great in the industry and great for our company and we had unit types there increases that we could get on renewals. And when you had bad years, like 2009 we had unit types that we did get increased on renewal. So it is a unit-by-unit thing. It is a market thing as it relates to maybe legal restrictions. But Michael and his team starting going forward are going to be looking at this saying, restrictions are removed. How do we now feel about supply and demand in the market and how are we going to think about this and that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re expecting to play it.\nWes Golladay: Okay. One last one. I guess, looking at your platform, probably a little different than many of your competitors in the market. So do you think you\u2019re taking share of new applicants with the special applications and the self showing?\nMichael Manelis: Well I think our closing ratios tell us kind of whether or not we\u2019re kind of taking more market share. I mean historically we would run against what we used to call foot traffic, but that\u2019s got a whole new definition now with virtual leasing. But people that express interest do historically would close somewhere in that 20% range for people that express interest take tours with you. And right now that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been balancing off. So when we\u2019re closing 30%, 35% we\u2019re getting more than kind of the normal share of those applicants.\nWes Golladay: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next move with Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJeff Spector: Great, thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups and then just maybe one big picture question. First on the \u2013 on occupancy in 2Q. I believe you mentioned you do expect 2Q to be the worst. I guess it\u2019s \u2013 just thinking about the applicants and \u2013 figuring out the right rent levels here. Is it just \u2013 it\u2019s going to be hard to convert those applicants into occupancy during 2Q, is that your expectations?\nMichael Manelis: No, I think I would say the impact from what we experienced at the tail end of March and April is really what brought kind of this occupancy down. Right now, even when you look at, call it the 900 applications that we had last week, call it 60% plus of them are moving in before May 22. So that\u2019s going to help kind of balance. So in the world of yield management, I mean you\u2019re optimizing revenue, you\u2019re trading off occupancy and rate and you\u2019re balancing this and that demand part of the equation is going to say whether or not you\u2019re going to optimize revenue at 95%, 95.5% or if you\u2019re going to kind of continue on this path, maybe you bounce back and start optimizing back at 96%. But I still think it\u2019s too early to understand where that sweet spot is for these portfolios.\nJeff Spector: Okay, thanks. And then I was surprised to hear that garden style delinquencies were higher than mid-to-high rise. I believe you made that comment. Can you provide a little bit more color there?\nMichael Manelis: Yes, sure. So it was \u2013 it was almost in every single market that we looked at. We can see that relationship and some of this just has to do with where our kind of rent to income ratios. So it wasn\u2019t surprising, right. When you think about Seattle being the lowest, while Seattle also has our lowest rent as a percent of income. And when you go to LA it was the highest percent of income. And those are markets like, when you start looking at that, where we absolutely had more garden style property versus the high-rise property. But that relationship held true across all of our markets.\nJeff Spector: Okay, thanks. And then in terms of the amenities, I thought it\u2019s encouraging to hear that you are working on, we used to open up the gyms or more open space and just thinking about working from home, is it too early to incorporate changes into buildings to maybe foster we\u2019re working from home environment within the apartment building. Like, can you set up areas that comply with social distancing to offer folks to work with, let say from a lounge within the building or is that just, is it too soon to tell?\nMichael Manelis: So I guess I will just start by saying first we have a whole group of individuals that are focused on what does it look like to be operating in the new normal. So that starts with looking at all of our existing common area space and understanding how are we going to guarantee the safety and wellbeing of our employees as well as our residents, once these spaces start to open up and operate. And I think that there\u2019s occupancy limits, there\u2019s spacing and fitness center, there\u2019s a lot of complexity to this and each one of our jurisdictions is going to have different kind of rules that we\u2019ll be applying to our operations as we think about opening up. But longer-term as we think about the fact that residents may be working from home more, it does create an opportunity for us to look at our common areas spaces and look at any of our available spaces that we may have in our properties and think about how do we make some adjustments to that to allow them the opportunity to work from home as well as adhere to social distancing. So I think you\u2019ll see us start to get creative with how we\u2019re using spaces going forward to allow for more of that to occur.\nJeff Spector: Thanks. And then my last question, just a big picture from Mark, I believe Mark you mentioned there might be opportunities, is it too soon to share with us, your thoughts on just kind of your EQR strategy going-forward? I mean in the New York, New Jersey area and I admit, I am a bit more worried about New York, I heard some optimism there that, tech will still come to New York and hopefully they still do. But, can you share with us some big picture thoughts on your go-forward strategy when you think about opportunities?\nMark Parrell: Great. So there\u2019s kind of two questions in that. Part of it I read is just when might we get active on the investment side and another is sort of a New York question, when that city might function a little better. And I guess I would start on the investment side by saying, as I said in my earlier remarks, there\u2019s just not a lot going on right now. We\u2019re seven weeks in, sellers still remember the price they would have gotten in early March and buyers think about the price they dream of getting right now and it\u2019s going to take a little while for that all to sort itself out. Some of the big deals that you might remember, we did we were quite active coming out of the great financial crisis. So purchasing the big portfolio in New York, and development land, and broken condos both on the East coast and the West coast those were all done 12 months to 18 months after the beginning of the great financial crisis. Those were fourth quarter, 2009 deals at the beginning and then into 2010. When you think about that crisis, the GFC really being at 2000 \u2013 mid-2008, third quarter of 2008 events. So I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s going to be a little while before we really see much to act on. So, I start with that. And the way we are sort of thinking about opportunity is trying to think about replacement costs a little bit, trying to think a little bit about what long-term growth will be in this market, did anything change that matters? And we think and this sort of gets into your New York question a little bit. We think these big cities and I\u2019ll focus a little on New York, are really quite resilient. I mean New York been through, as you\u2019re quite aware, riots, it\u2019s been through wars, it\u2019s been through epidemics before, it\u2019s been through 9/11 and after 9/11 there\u2019s a lot of comment that New York wouldn\u2019t come back and people would decamp from New York in size. And yet, New York had a terrific urbanization trend over the last 20 years and the population in New York city was higher in 2016 than it was in 2001. So I think every morning, millions of owners of businesses throughout the country are waking up trying to figure out how to run their restaurant, their cultural amenities, their nonprofit, their restaurant, whatever. And they\u2019re going to figure that out over time and we\u2019re going to have new rules about distancing and cleanliness, then over time, hopefully there\u2019s some cure to this and we don\u2019t have this top of mind, but I think these cities are going to adjust like they always have. And I think you could expect that we\u2019ll still be focused in our investment efforts on these large cities and these dense suburban areas for our apartment investment.\nJeff Spector: Thank you for your thoughts. I wish everyone well.\nMark Parrell: Yes, same. You stay well.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nHardik Goel: Thanks for the color. I haven\u2019t promised \u2013 market, are you seeing a difference in investor sentiment and the gateway city is versus somewhere like Denver. And what is your thought on, where cap rates might eventually the federal out when buyers and sellers meet in the middle?\nMark Parrell: Great. So I\u2019m going to repeat that back to make sure I understood it. You had a question about where cap rates might end up through this and then investor interest in some of these less dense markets like Denver. The first, the Denver question or the investor interest question. As we look at that, it\u2019s just again, a little early for us to sort that out. I think some types of trades like for example, the value-add trade may be less attractive. I think you\u2019re going to have a hard time doing your renovations, you\u2019re going to have hard time jacking up \u2018rents, all of those things. And a lot of the value-add deals that were done just before the pandemic are likely to perform pretty poorly. So my sense is that you\u2019re going to see investor interest get sorted out. And I think, and we\u2019ve talked about this in the last call. Cap rates had really compressed between all these markets and I think as you go through this recession and you get past some of this government stimulus, you\u2019re going to see people with better resident basis like ours perform better. And you\u2019re going to see those cap rates on those properties be more durable than cap rates than it\u2019s sort of come down on B and C quality stuff and in lesser markets and have lesser employment basis than the ones we\u2019re in. So that is our sense of things in terms of where cap rates end up. Part of this is of course a function of interest rates and rates are incredibly low, but there\u2019s also a limiter because of replacement costs. So I think there\u2019s a bunch of things going on with cap rates. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if cap rates in two or three years weren\u2019t lower, than they were before the pandemic because of the interaction of interest rates. My sense that the apartment sector and our company in particular will perform better than most other real estate and that there\u2019ll be more capital attracted to the area. And then you just got to think about replacement costs, because you\u2019d be careful about paying big premiums to replacement costs no matter what interest rates are when you buy an asset. So I guess I look through it and say, wouldn\u2019t surprise me if cap rates were lower in a few years than what they are now for those reasons.\nHardik Goel: And just as a quick follow-up, could you split out what delinquency is? For just garden style properties versus let\u2019s say you\u2019re high-rise.\nMark Parrell: Yes, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to give quite that level of detail. I think that\u2019s just probably more than we have at our fingertips.\nHardik Goel: Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s all from me.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRich Hill: Hey almost good afternoon guys. At least on the East Coast, just two quick final \u2013 follow-up questions. When we think about the 97% of rents that you collected versus March, I\u2019m sorry if you mentioned this already, but does that 97% include the declining occupancies that you noted or should we think about the declining occupancies on top of the 97% of rents you collected?\nBob Garechana: Let me make sure I understand the question kind of frame of reference and I\u2019m going to rephrase it and hopefully this answers your question. It\u2019s Bob here, Rich. So the 97% is measured half of March, rental payments. In March we had higher occupancy, right. So then we did in April, so if anything, it probably understate that 97% probably understates what the collection percentage is as a whole. Does that answer your question?\nRich Hill: Yes, I think that\u2019s exactly what I was trying to get at. So said another way, if your occupancy went down 1.5 percentage point and that would be included in the percent of rent that you did not collect compared to the month prior.\nBob Garechana: That is correct.\nRich Hill: Okay, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then one bigger picture question. I\u2019ve heard a lot of conversations about the GFC, but I\u2019m curious, why isn\u2019t post 9/11 a better proxy for what this recession might look like? Obviously a big shock to the system, payrolls went down, there were some job losses, but maybe job loss is focused on lower income earners. How do you guys think about that? And I recognize not everyone\u2019s been in the industry since 9/11, but you guys have a long institutional memory. So how do you think about this versus 9/11?\nMichael Manelis: Well, most of us in this room were, so we remember that unfortunate event distinctly. First off, I\u2019d say our portfolio compared to the 2008 great financial crisis is very similar. When you go all the way back to 2001 it\u2019s a very different portfolio. So when you think about what lessons we would pull out of that, when that happened, of course it also created this \u2013 which led to the next problem, created a big boom in purchasing single family homes. And so our markets like Phoenix, where we owned at that point, really suffered. I don\u2019t know how to think about that. Again, rates are really low, but mortgage capital is not that loose. So I appreciate that there are similarities both to the GFC and to the 9/11, because 9/11 was much more of that existential shock like COVID is, but our portfolio was so different, it\u2019s hard for me to draw some lessons to share with you.\nRich Hill: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. All right that\u2019s it for me guys. I appreciate the transparency in this quarter.\nMichael Manelis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could quantify, what do you think the impact is on rent deferrals and reduced fees to the same store revenue?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So the answer for all question, I guess the long-term impact will depend on kind of what bad debt turns out to be John, right. So we\u2019re not providing guidance, but that will factor in deferral, you would recognize your revenue in a normal course. The question is what bad debt ends up being on that piece. Certainly we will be impacted by fee revenue or lack of fee revenue potentially with lower applications and some of tax in our markets, but it\u2019s hard to \u2013 it\u2019s not a meaningful part of the overall top line, so it\u2019s not a huge impact.\nMark Parrell: And I would say even the fact that we\u2019ve been waiving late fees, that\u2019s a short-term kind of impact and even those dollars are not that significant.\nMichael Manelis: Yes.\nJohn Kim: But if the tenant is on a payment plan or deferred rent, it would not impact the FFO and also not impact same store revenue. Is that correct?\nMark Parrell: So if a resident is on \u2013 a tenant on the nonresidential side is on a deferral program, you\u2019re still going to recognize the revenue unless you believe the revenue is not collectible, at which point you\u2019re going to reserve against the revenue or take a bad debt expense against that revenue line items. So all sheer nature of having deferral doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re not going to recognize the revenue. It\u2019s all about collectability.\nMichael Manelis: Debt delinquency is just to tell you where we\u2019ve charged revenue but haven\u2019t received cash. So over time, to be very specific and this will be a discussion with our auditors and the audit committee, and we\u2019ll think about this, because again we\u2019re fortunate not to be either familiar with delinquency, alright. So we\u2019ll get into June and July and we\u2019ll look at these folks and we\u2019ll see if they\u2019re performing per the payment plans, if they\u2019re still in the units and we\u2019ll write things off and that will run through revenue. That\u2019s where bad debt runs through revenue. And then there\u2019ll be a number of people that will effectively have this receivable outstanding and we\u2019ll be getting paid on it. And we\u2019ll be hopefully just as transparent as we are right now with you about all those numbers, whether it be write-off, whether it remains in the account receivable and what\u2019s the status of the payments we\u2019ve received on delinquent accounts.\nJohn Kim: Yes, that makes sense. And then the secondly, I was wondering if you offer to your tenants payment of rent with credit cards and if you\u2019ve seen any trends that in the last couple of months.\nMichael Manelis: Yes, so we did, well. First of all, we\u2019ve always had the option to pay rent with a credit card, it\u2019s just that there were fees associated with that processing fees. So through the process of our conversations, we are allowing residents to pay their delinquent balance with a credit card and we would absorb the processing fee. It just is not a material number at all, right now. The fees are well below even a $100,000 kind of level.\nMark Parrell: Yes, that\u2019s really encouraging because that shows you that our residents aren\u2019t living hand to mouth and having to put a month credit card on their credit card or rental payment. So we think that\u2019s encouraging from our point of view.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMark Parrell: Thank you John. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Good morning. Good morning out there. So two questions: First, can you just go back through the delinquency? So the 5.5% delinquents, number of municipalities, New York, California, et cetera? Have the eviction moratoriums so it would seem like tenants really don\u2019t have any incentive to go on a payment plan for a good period of time as these things are pushed out? But Mark, you said that a lot of people are coming to you voluntarily and not many have been ghosting. So how do we reconcile the two that a lot of your tenants seem to be coming to you and yet the delinquencies are still high? Are people playing the eviction thing, and they just realized that they can skip a few months rent and pay it next year or maybe never pay it? Or how should we think about this?\nMark Parrell: Hey, Alex, it\u2019s Mark. I guess I\u2019m going to take issue with the idea that our delinquency is high. I mean, I \u2013 again you\u2019re talking about a company with $220-plus million, a monthly residential revenue that in \u2013 what is the worst panic of our lifetimes? Maybe as $5 million of rent we\u2019re chasing around and making progress on. So I don\u2019t feel like this is a big number of people. I\u2019m more concerned, frankly, about the recession than I am about delinquency in our portfolio. Listen, we\u2019ve got high-level credit tenants. These obligations aren\u2019t going away. We\u2019re not going anywhere. So these are folks that value their credit that know they\u2019re receiving a great service. I mean I\u2019m lucky I get to read all the feedback that our residents right on our teams on site. And that feedback, Alex, has been really good. They really appreciate that our people, our frontline workers at EQR are keeping the property clean, are maintaining all the essential parts of the building so they can shelter-in-place. They don\u2019t look at this rent as something they need to avoid, they don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not ripping them off, we\u2019re taking care of them in a crisis. So I guess, I\u2019d say I think our resident mindset, at least as far as I can tell is very different than the sort of resident mindset you\u2019re describing. Are there a few people that are taking advantage of the system and creating this moral hazard? Absolutely. And that\u2019s just playing on. I mean we\u2019re turning around and paying their rent in property taxes to these hard press municipalities, to our hard-working frontline workers. I mean that\u2019s just wrong, but I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re not going to stop being persistent pursuing them. We\u2019ll follow the law, but they owe the rent. And sooner or later, there will be a discussion about that. So I guess I\u2019d put it to you that way.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. No, listen, that\u2019s \u2013 Mark, that\u2019s helpful. Yes. And then second question is, just in New York, specifically, obviously, a lot of us are impacted, whether we live in the city or outside of commute. But from what you are hearing from your property from the managers there, are you hearing about what are they saying their residents are looking to do? Are a number looking to leave, are a number looking to move in? Because you say you keep your buildings better maintained than probably a number of your New York neighbors. So what is the sort of mood and expectation for New York this summer through the summer leasing season?\nMark Parrell: Well, I guess I would just start by saying New York, one, it\u2019s always had the strongest retention in the portfolio, but it absolutely is seeing an improved retention with renewals at that 70% level. We\u2019ve never experienced that in the city. So a lot of our residents are staying put. And it\u2019s not like they\u2019re just staying for a month or two months, they\u2019re renewing at those 12-month terms. As far as the front door, that\u2019s a really tough thing to answer right now because it\u2019s not rebounding yet like the other markets have, which understandably, it\u2019s the hardest hit from the COVID. So I think we need to see a little bit of the public health crisis kind of soften or dampen a little bit in New York to get a feel as to what the new folks coming in are saying and what they\u2019re looking for and everything else like that. But I think the retention side of it, short term, is a positive for us.\nMichael Manelis: The other thing, Alex, we\u2019ve been wondering about, and we don\u2019t know. As Mark said, the biggest question mark is just when do the stay at home orders get lifted? And when do people feel comfortable getting out there and looking for apartments and doing virtual tours. I mean there\u2019s going to be more distancing, but are they going to feel comfortable doing a self-guided tour in our property on their own, but they\u2019re able to see the site. Those are more efficient. Those are good marketing techniques. That will improve closing. So we\u2019re trying to balance all that. We\u2019ve also done some extensions of people into the fall. Those people probably want to go somewhere, and it\u2019s probably true that there\u2019s other people and other apartment owners\u2019 portfolios. So we wonder about whether the lease \u2013 this isn\u2019t a leasing season different than any other, where it might go \u2013 might be as high a peak, but kind of go a little bit longer into the shoulder season a bit. But that\u2019s a little speculation on our part we\u2019re trying to sort out, because again, we and no one else has been through this before.\nAlexander Goldfarb: And hopefully, we don\u2019t go through it for another 100 years. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thanks. Stay well.\nOperator: Thank you. We will go next with Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRick Skidmore: Good morning, thank you. Just one quick question. As you think about occupancy and the trade-off of kind of grow occupancy, how do you think about tenant credit quality or the various tenants that you\u2019re looking at? And are you able to perhaps high grade? Or do you move perhaps down the credit quality spectrum as you look to build occupancy? Thank you.\nMichael Manelis: So right now, I will tell you, we\u2019re not changing our models, our criteria for underwriting residents. I mean we have a strong resident base, and I think that\u2019s proven some of the benefits out right now. And I think we\u2019re going to continue down that path. Obviously, if the demand profiles totally change through the summer and all that, we can revisit that and pull some levers and make some changes. But at this point, we don\u2019t expect to do that.\nRick Skidmore: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJohn Guinee: John Guinee here. Question, first, hey Mark, nice \u2013 really nice job today. Give me a little more detail, what does ghosted us exactly mean?\nMark Parrell: Thanks for that comment, and I\u2019m going to hand it over to Michael because we\u2019ve used that term, he and I between us, and maybe that needs more definition.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I think just to give some color to that. Obviously, our on-type, they\u2019re working really hard. And I think I said this before, this is difficult, right, because it\u2019s heavy lifting to go after some of these delinquent balances because you have to have the ear, you have to have the tone of empathy, but you also have to reinforce the obligations that sit with this stuff. So we have outreach programs, right, for folks that we haven\u2019t heard from. We\u2019re trying to do well-being checks on many of our residents that we haven\u2019t heard from as well. And the term ghosting is we\u2019ve left some messages, we\u2019ve sent some e-mails, and we\u2019ve gotten zero response back from those folks. And again, I think Mark alluded to it. It\u2019s a small subset of this group that we\u2019re dealing with. But eventually, we have to have some conversations with these folks.\nJohn Guinee: Okay. So it doesn\u2019t mean they moved out in the dark of night and took half their furniture with them or maybe not? It just means they\u2019re going silent on you?\nMichael Manelis: Goon silent. I mean some of the markets; we\u2019re putting some notices on the door to make sure because we will enter to make sure that it hasn\u2019t been vacated on us, and that is part of a process, but that is one of the things that we would be doing.\nJohn Guinee: Okay. And then second, you obviously have a computer-generated revenue optimization tools and to run like everybody else run to full occupancy. Is there a color, both in good and bad in terms of how far you would drop rents in the next six to 12 months to maintain full occupancy? Or are you not there yet?\nMark Parrell: No. We\u2019re definitely not there yet. I guess I can give you a little bit of context. So first and foremost, in the beginning of March, we changed some of our parameters inside these yield management applications to just lessen the volatility of pricing to begin with. On March 20th, we actually stopped generating prices from the pricing engine. We turned it off in essence and just let all of our prices stay as they were regardless of lease term, regardless duration of lease as well. So at that point, now we\u2019re watching and we\u2019re seeing the kind of the application \u2013 or the traffic come back and the application volume come back. So just a couple of weeks ago, we started to reinitialize kind of that LRO or the yield management application to start sending out the daily price changes as well. So I don\u2019t know exactly, I think I said this before, where we\u2019ll optimize kind of revenue, what level of occupancy it is and what rate decline you\u2019d allow. I think demand is going to tell you where \u2013 what that market clearing price needs to be. But I think you can see right now, I alluded to the fact that the base rents are down 4%, and we\u2019re closing at a higher percentage of what we normally would be. So that, to me, feels like the right level today, and we\u2019ll just see where the demand levels are going forward.\nJohn Guinee: Okay. Great. And then last question, I think you\u2019ve got increased disclosure. Thank you. Any consideration of bringing back your disclosure for your consolidated joint ventures?\nMark Parrell: I mean, so our unconsolidated joint ventures at the moment are really just one asset that\u2019s it\u2019s a garage parking kind of\u2026\nBon Garechana: Did you say consolidated or unconsolidated?\nJohn Guinee: You\u2019re consolidated. You use to carve out your partners\u2019 ownership or economics of the consolidated JVs? I think you stopped doing that?\nMark Parrell: Got it. Yes. It\u2019s a very de-minimis amount. Happy to give you more color, and Marty or I could give you more color about it. But it\u2019s a very small percentage. And it\u2019s also; I think there\u2019s more disclosure in the 10-Q \u2013 in the footnotes in the 10-Q. We just stopped including a whole page in the supplemental of the press release. But in the 10-Q, we can point you to some color on that.\nJohn Guinee: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Haendel Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel Juste: Hello out there.\nMark Parrell: Hey Haendel.\nHaendel Juste: So, I think your comments earlier on potential changes you\u2019re considering to the annual leasing cycle in a post-COVID world interesting that more leasing could be shifted forward out of the second quarter and third quarter periods where I think historically you\u2019ve done 60% plus of your leasing. So just curious on how active some of these considerations are and how that might look? Any color that would be appreciated. Thanks.\nMark Parrell: Yes. So I\u2019m going to start, it\u2019s Mark, and Michael is going to supplement here. This is more of us looking at small sample sizes and seeing a little shifting and trying to figure out the conduct of our customer in this kind of hairy situation. So I can\u2019t tell you, we\u2019re sure that demand will be flattened out. It will just be longer. That\u2019s just; again, we have a few of those. Michael, by turning on the pricing machine, has already begun doing something. We don\u2019t want to do six month leases now and have expirations in the late fourth quarter. So to incentivize us to do that, we are going to raise your rent. If you want a renewal for a one-year term on like-term, we\u2019ll do that flat. So I guess, Haendel, we\u2019re going to still manage our expiration schedule, but there are a few people who took shorter term and our portfolio and we\u2019re guessing others, shorter term extensions in March and April because listen, no one was in a position to really move and so you may see some of those people turn around and go, okay, now I\u2019m ready. It\u2019s August and they would have been ready instead in April or May, right. So there may be a little bit of a shift, but it\u2019s not fully discernible, I\u2019d say at this point.\nHaendel Juste: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just to be clear, the folks who are taking short-term lease extensions here, are they subject to the same premiums that they would have been historically or before COVID or are those also been extended at zero percent?\nMichael Manelis: No. So, everybody basically since March 15 has had flexibility to move to any term at no increase at no increase. We basically froze rents regardless of term and now, we\u2019re starting to pivot and change off of that. And that was our way to kind of help people through these unprecedented times, people that were really nervous about moving. We wanted to give them the opportunity to just stay. So I think the peak leasing season, like we all knew it, is definitely impacted from this. We just don\u2019t understand yet how that impact is going to play out.\nHaendel Juste: Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. Another \"lives in a post-COVID world\" question. I\u2019m curious if your recent experience with virtual and contactless leasing makes you more inclined to accelerate and increase tech investments here near term as you tweak operating platform for a post-COVID world? And what do you think some of the more lasting changes in your leasing and operations approach could be? I\u2019m assuming in that kind of world, you\u2019ll have more virtual leasing, maybe less need for on-site personnel. So just curious on how the business might be changed here, your views on technology investments? And then maybe some thoughts on retail exposure. Is that something that perhaps going forward you would look to have less loss?\nMichael Manelis: So, this is Michael. Maybe I\u2019ll start with just kind of the impact on the operations. I will tell you, I think you\u2019ve heard us talk a lot about what we were doing from a sales process and all the initiatives that we were teeing up before all this. I think this was an accelerator to us. I think this just advanced a lot of the things that we were already kind of teeing up and thinking about. I think it added a new layer with this virtual leasing and having kind of high-content video available, doing FaceTime kind of live tours. That\u2019s a new element to the sales process. And I think going forward, we\u2019re going to continue to have all of the above available as our sales process. It\u2019s just another tool kind of that we\u2019ll have available to close leases and applications. As far as the tech investment side goes, this did not change the tech investment that we were thinking about from the service side of the business. We already deployed that mobile kind of software. And I\u2019ll be honest with you, that was a huge advantage for us in this. It allowed our team to quickly pivot to focus on urgent service requests only. We had complete transparency at the top of the house as to what was happening all the way down to an individual tech. So we knew what needed to get done all from your mobile device. That was a big win. On the sales side of the business, we\u2019ve already made most of the investments in the technology that we\u2019re going to need to run. I think the biggest thing that was out there is you heard us talk about making some investment into the smart home technology, where we were getting ready to move forward with about 10,000 units this year. We already have about 2,500 units deployed. I think that\u2019s one of the areas that we\u2019ll probably pause, and we\u2019re going to see the next-gen of technology come out that probably won\u2019t have keypads that will be Bluetooth-enabled. There\u2019s already some of this technology available. But we\u2019ll just wait to see it kind of get vet out a little bit, and then we\u2019ll continue to move forward with that. But I think as you think about operations going forward, it is very clear that contactless, touch-free, those are kind of things that are going to be with us in this environment, not only immediately but probably even longer term in this world of new normal. And Bob, maybe you want to just hit on the retail?\nBob Garechana: Yes. No. The retail and non-residential pieces, we\u2019ve always focused on minimizing that exposure. We\u2019ve focused on investing in high-quality apartment buildings, right? We\u2019re an apartment company, so that hasn\u2019t changed. That\u2019s how we ended up with the limited exposure that we have here today. So I don\u2019t think from a strategy standpoint, that\u2019s going to change at all. In our markets, particularly in the urban areas, there is typically, with these high-quality assets, some exposure to retail.\nHaendel Juste: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And one more clarification. I think earlier, you guys mentioned that 60% of the new leases you signed recently are set to move in before May 12? I wonder if I heard that correctly. And then I guess I\u2019m more curious how the time between lease approval and movement is being impacted here by COVID? Any noticeable change or delay in that timing on either your part or the customer\u2019s part? And maybe help us put that 60% figure into some context? Thanks.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So first, it\u2019s 60% of the applications last week are scheduled to move in before May 22, not May 12. And I think from a behavior standpoint, as you think about the duration, I think this is the time of the year, right, where you have a lot of people looking to lease future months. Their leases are expiring. That\u2019s typically what you see in a peak leasing season. And I think we\u2019re seeing that. We\u2019re seeing demand for June still, and we\u2019re seeing some of our notice to vacate or units that we will have become vacant in the future, those are being sold today; but not a huge change in their normal behavior.\nHaendel Juste: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will next go with Nick Joseph from Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Mark, I wanted \u2013 and look, I appreciate your comments about the resiliency of New York and other dense urban cities. But I also know that this is a pretty unprecedented time that doesn\u2019t have sort of a marker relative to other times. And I wanted to know what the house view, and I don\u2019t know if this means a TAM\u2019s view, but collectively, as an equity organization about the interplay between office utilization and where you live, whether that\u2019s a rental apartment or a house or a condo or whatever it is. But the whole dynamic, once we get post this, and just from a frame of reference, yes, 9/1 had a massive impact, clearly in New York and organizations\u2019 desires to be in big office towers. This \u2013 what we\u2019re going through now is 100% of Corporate America, except for essential workers, have their organizations working remotely. I would imagine that, that is going to change some element of how corporations will see where their workforces are, who they are and where they may live. And I would have thought that could have significant impacts in terms of how things would play out from a residential perspective. So can you dive a little bit more into that element?\nMark Parrell: Sure. A lot there to unpack. And I certainly think very thoughtful. And I mean, it is an evolving situation. No doubt, this is a 100-year event, we hope, and we\u2019re going to go all go through it together and figure it out. I was trying to get to this thought process about vibrancy and flexibility that these big urban areas have gone through a lot before, and they\u2019ll figure this out too in ways that we can\u2019t yet determine. And you talked just a little bit. And I wonder about that, Michael, about corporate preferences versus individuals. And people could probably always live in different places and telecommute, and now they\u2019ll be able to telecommute even more. I agree with that part of it. But our sorts of people, these affluent renters, they like living in these urban and dense suburban places. And right now, they\u2019re thrown off a little because we\u2019re all trying to figure out how do you run New York City with more social distancing and cleanliness. Is it shift? So how does that all work? But every day, millions of people are waking up trying to figure out how to do that, how to run the transit systems and the restaurants and all of that. So I guess I\u2019d say, I\u2019m certainly not of the mind that that\u2019s something you abandon very quickly, that all of a sudden, we\u2019re all moving to ex-urban and rural settings. That doesn\u2019t make sense to me that the preference for young affluent renters like we have to live in these cities among their peers is pretty durable and pretty strong. So I guess I don\u2019t deny this is unprecedented, but I guess I\u2019d answer by saying the companies may allow more teleworking and almost certainly will, us include. But I think residents \u2013 or excuse me, employees will still choose where they care to reside. And I think our markets will still be very attractive to them and that the denser solutions, especially as we work through new ways to be clean inside buildings and the distance inside buildings, that will kind of work itself out over time. So I guess that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the house view, but that\u2019s the sort of EQR view. And I think Sam has been on record very recently in a big broadcast about the strength of the residential business. So I think we feel good about our business model.\nMichael Bilerman: Right. I just \u2013 I wonder if there is an investment or a future opportunity if corporations are going to have some portion of their workforce, right? The incremental hire they\u2019re going to have, I would believe Corporate America, just as you would look at an employee and say, we can find a really good operations person that may not have to be in Chicago and be in the head office, but given all of our technological improvements, and we\u2019ve all now had this trial it works. You may find that incremental higher, you may want to put in Denver or another local market where you don\u2019t have an office, and that person, if they\u2019re living in an EQR community may lead a certain amount of office. And so is there an opportunity to further the investment in your communities to provide a \u2013 and you\u2019d already started some of this in terms of the need of co-working and things like that. I don\u2019t know if there is a trend there that you started to think about?\nMark Parrell: Yes. I mean Michael had some comments on that. I mean we are trying to figure out how we can make our apartment buildings even more comfortable as these common areas open up in this new distancing and cleanliness environment. I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on right now. And you\u2019re right to ask about, and I think we want to make our properties attractive for people to spend more hours per day than they probably have in the past, at least for a while. And the good news is you\u2019ve been in a lot of our buildings. They have terrific amenities. They have terrific \u2013 most of them have just terrific lounges and large roof decks in places where you can be home but be outside your unit for a period of time and still feel safe. So I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ll market. And again, we\u2019ve got to get the cleanliness and the safety thing right as an industry, and we will. And then I think you\u2019ll have the advantage of being at-home but outside your unit and will feel good to our residents.\nMichael Bilerman: Right. And just last thing in these higher density, higher rent locations, there\u2019s a certain aspect of these cities that have a massive cultural aspect. And while I would think about L.A. and San Francisco, New York, Seattle, all trying to reopen parts of that. You\u2019re not going to reopen it at full force. And the other part of it is the taxes in those locations are very high, and the employment places are not going to bring back 100% of their employees because they can\u2019t in a social distance world. And I just wonder whether more younger, affluent people are going to say, I\u2019m just going to go lease in Denver or Austin or Miami for a year because I don\u2019t \u2013 my office doesn\u2019t need a 100% going back and none of the things that I live in the city for can I enjoy. And so could the occupancies get further in the near term before we sort of come out on the other side?\nMark Parrell: Great question. I can\u2019t give you certainty on any of this. I\u2019ll just say that, so far, we\u2019ve seen demand even in lockdown start to head up again already. I mean it seems to us that our demographic, and this is anecdotal, I have a daughter who\u2019s college age. I know a lot of kids in their mid-20s, and they don\u2019t want to live with their parents anymore. They want to go back to the big cities and be in their apartments and live their lives again. So I guess I\u2019d be more anxious about owning a bunch of apartment buildings in Orlando or Miami, where they\u2019re hospitality-dependent, that\u2019s closed down and you wonder, how many people who work at airports and hotels and theme parks and cruise lines will ever come back to work. I think that\u2019s a pretty salient question to ask. I think you\u2019re right, there\u2019s \u2013 these telecommuting options will be more available to people. But I think people didn\u2019t live in Brooklyn because it was cheap, people live in Brooklyn because they love the cultural amenities, they love the restaurants and all that stuff\u2019s closed down. And now everyone\u2019s figuring out how to reopen it, and I think it will reopen and over a period of time, as you suggested, and make those submarkets that we operate in continue to be pretty attractive.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. All right. Appreciate taking time to answer the questions and for all the details you gave and they are really superb.\nMark Parrell: Stay healthy. Appreciate the big questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will next go with Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nHardik Goel: I just wanted to be respectful of everyone\u2019s time, so I joined back in. Mark, I guess, is \u2013 it\u2019s not so much a question, but I just need your help understanding something. Garden has higher delinquency across your portfolio. The employment basis in some of the markets you are not in is weaker and yet, EQR is trading at a discount to some of its other peers, the greater discount than it\u2019s ever traded at. And there\u2019s this narrative about the future of apartments and suburban living and all that. But right now, we have 30% unemployment. And your portfolio has performed really well through that. And unemployment has got to be in some markets, so I\u2019m a little confused by the investor response, and \u2013 I just don\u2019t get it?\nMark Parrell: Well, I just would ask you to spread the word. I \u2013 listen, I think what we were trying to get across in the release, besides this general feeling of empathy and concern for our communities, which are going through hell and back right now is that we did pretty well in April. We did pretty well as a company in the midst of this pandemic. And when you look long term, a lot of what just happened with COVID, doesn\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t look at our strategy and go, that doesn\u2019t make sense, like you do some other real estate sectors. Our strategy makes a lot of sense. But in between then and now is this recession, and we\u2019re all going to go through that, and we\u2019re going to see how it goes. Our company has been pretty resilient through those. We\u2019ve come out of it historically faster and better. So I think we just need to make our case and continue to be effective and transparent. And we\u2019re confident investors over time, and smart analysts like you will pick it up and people will see the opportunity. So I guess we think about running the business long term, and investors will respond to it over the long run.\nHardik Goel: Thanks. And you know, really appreciate the disclosures you guys put out. I think the reporting and the messaging was really transparent and high quality. Thanks a lot guys.\nMark Parrell: Thank you. All credit to Bob and his team. So thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. This marks the end of the question-and-answer session. I will give the floor back to the moderator.\nMark Parrell: Well, we thank you all for your time today, and we hope everyone stays healthy. Good day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for your participation. You may go ahead and disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. So today, I'm going to provide a quick recap of operations over the past 45 days. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were off to a very good start for the year. Our occupancy was ahead of expectations, and we were well positioned for the primary leasing season. And then COVID-19 hit, causing us to adjust our operations to this new unprecedented challenge. Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees during these unprecedented times. They inspire me with their ability to quickly adjust operations while keeping an intense focus on our customers, properties, themselves and their families. Shelter-in-place was mandated by governors in our markets in early to mid-March. For us, this means that our more than 150,000 residents began staying at home 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In response to shelter-in-place, we made some key changes to our operations. We closed our common area amenities, we increased cleaning frequency, we quickly modified our website and our artificial intelligent E-Lead responses to pivot the entire sales process to virtual leasing. Capturing video content and conducting the sales process via video conversations allowed the business to continue uninterrupted. This process would have normally taken us several months to accomplish. We also locked the office doors to encourage social distancing but kept the business running as we implemented shift rotations of the staff to reduce the number of employees coming to the property. When we look back to March 15, we saw our traffic and applications drop 50% compared to the same period in 2019. That being said, we continued to receive over 375 new applications each week through the end of March, which we see as a validation of the new leasing process. With reduced traffic coming through the front door, our focus has been on keeping current residents in place. We are currently offering residents the option to renew without increase. Overall, retention in April and May has improved as we are now renewing in the mid to upper 60% range, which is a 300 basis point improvement from last April and an almost 800 basis point improvement from last May. New York is having the strongest renewal percents of nearly 70% for March, April and May. Despite this good retention, our overall occupancy since March 31 has declined by 130 basis points. We expect the occupancy impact to be the most pronounced in the second quarter, setting a new base from which we hope it will improve as shelter-in-place orders are lifted. Let me share some color on the performance in April. At the beginning of April, we began to notice an improvement in demand, with both traffic and leasing activity rebounding by almost 30% and actually now trending on par with last year. In fact, we had over 900 applications last week, which is a significant improvement compared to the 375 that we were averaging in late March and very encouraging for us. Given the activity in the last 45 days, we would like to see that volume grow even more to help offset the lower demand that we experienced in March and to match the increased volume of applications that we usually get in May. What is clear is that our high-quality, well-located portfolio continues to attract future residents. While the pandemic is certainly a deterrent, people have life reasons that require them to move like changes in jobs or partners. On Page 13, we reported the first quarter and included April monthly pricing statistics by market. I would remind everybody this is only one month of data, and that longer periods of time are usually required to show definitive trends. Mark mentioned the strength and quality of our resident base. This is evident by the fact that we received a very strong 97% of the cash collections in April relative to our March collections. This resilience delivered 5.4% delinquency, which is quite good given these unprecedented circumstances. Notably, Seattle and Denver were our markets with the lowest delinquency at below 3% and Los Angeles was the laggard close to 8%. The rest of our markets were centered around the average. We have also taken a cut at looking at property type. And in most of our markets, our garden-style or more suburban assets have experienced higher delinquency than our mid-rise, high-rise more urban locations. As we move through the continued disruptions created by COVID-19, we remain strategic in our pricing efforts. Sitting here today, our base rents are down 4% compared to the same week last year. Let me give you some color on notable markets. Overall, our strongest market is Seattle, which has shown great resilience, with limited delinquency and the best overall revenue growth performance in the portfolio. New York is a bit of a mixed story. On one hand, it has the strongest retention of any market, but it has also not shown the signs of recovery that other markets have with traffic and applications. Long-term, we expect the New York market to benefit from low new supply and technology firms expanding their presence in the city. We are hoping leasing activity will improve as the hard-hit New York area gets through the worst of the pandemic. Finally, we started 2020 anticipating that Los Angeles would have a very challenging year given the new supply pressure. COVID will definitely add to this. Despite recent improvements in applications, we expect this market to remain challenged with meaningful pricing pressure that will continue as supply is delivered. So where do we go from here? Well, we're now in the early stages of preparing our properties for the new normal. We expect things to shift over time. Right now, the new normal is going to be focused on increased deep cleaning standards at the properties; adjustments to the layout of common areas, including fitness and lounges to accommodate social distancing; balancing the capabilities of virtual leasing with the need to engage with our customers; and ultimately, staggering work shifts to ensure that we limit the number of employees on-site at any given time. These are challenging times, but our business is resilient, and our teams are positioned to deliver. Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Bob. So this is Michael. I guess I would just say, so first and foremost, yes, you're right. This is very early in the month. But right now, looking at kind of how we closed out yesterday, we are identical, like right on par to the way collections kind of played out through the month of April. Yes. So maybe I'll start, and then Bob can kind of fill in. So first and foremost, I mean, I think you can see from the release, we're dealing with about $11 million in total delinquency, and that was above the $5.4 million that we had in the previous month. So the process that we're going through right now is we're working through conversations with all of these residents, with both kind of an empathetic mindset as well as an obligation kind of reminder mindset. And that's a tough balance that our teams are doing, but we're setting up various payment plans in places, and we're just documenting kind of the financial hardships that many of our residents have experienced from this. And we'll be navigating and working through those conversations through the month of May, just like we did in the month of April. So I think, first, in the prepared remarks, I kind of identified, right? Seattle and Denver were absolutely the lowest at 3% or below total delinquency. L.A. was the highest at 8%. As far as property types, we definitely saw kind of lower delinquency at the high-rise, kind of mid-rise product versus kind of the more suburban or garden-style. So I think right now, in regard to deferred rent, I mean, the nature of these conversations are all over the place. I mean these are very one-on-one conversations that we're having. But much of that delinquency or at least the incremental delinquency from hardships is set up in payment plans or set up into deferred rent situations. And I think the varying state of emergency orders that we have around the country are going to dictate when those payment plans are going to allow for payments to reoccur. And Nick, I want to answer just precisely, delinquency includes everything, including the payment plan. So that number is all-inclusive as it relates to the residential book. There isn't \u2013 like, if it's a payment plan, it isn't suddenly undelinquent. It remains in our books to link. We just aren't pursuing the resident, we have a deal with them, but we don't \u2013 we include that in our number. Thank you. Sure. So maybe \u2013 this is Michael. I'll start off. I guess I would tell you, to date, we probably have incurred about $0.5 million of expense specific to COVID, and that would include kind of not only the increased cleaning standards that are occurring at our properties, but also some of the personal protection equipment that we've been acquiring. And I think some of the offset has been, obviously, we we're incurring less overtime expense on our payroll. We're experiencing less turnover expense. But then on the flip side, having all these residents living with us, we're also having some increased trash expense that's mitigating some of those offsets. Yes, so I mean, I think we're looking at kind of what it looks like to kind of reopen and what that new normal is going to look and feel like. I think it is clear to expect that we are going to be spending more money on cleaning standards and protocols at our properties. But I think that we're going to be balancing kind of that out, not only kind of with the labor and the overtime, but trying to figure out more things that we're going to get done in-house versus relying on contract labor. Yes. So this is Michael. So I think first and foremost, you got to realize the April numbers that we reported on renewals, many of those offers were generated in January and February. So many of those leases were already executed well before kind of COVID-19 pandemic began. When we started issuing those offers in mid to late March, those are really for kind of May, June and now even July offers that are out there. So I think what you could expect to see is May is going to trend down, probably be somewhere between 50 to 100 basis points positive. And then in June is when I would expect that you'll start to see us kind of deliver flat on the renewal increase percent. Yes. Well, I think in the prepared remarks, I kind of stated that base rents or amenitized rents right now are down about 4% compared to the same week last year. So as you kind of just fast-forward your way through May, you could expect that, that new lease change could deteriorate down to that 4%. But again, the numbers that you're looking on that release, if you go to the footnote of that, you'll see that the 12 to 12 are the like term actually improves by about 110 basis points, so it's actually down negative 80 basis points. So I don't know exactly where we'll land because, again, this is kind of a lease-by-lease thing that you work through to see these stats, which is why I always caution everybody from looking at just one month. But I think I'd like to just understand where are my amenitized or asking rents relative to last year, and that's that kind of down 4% level. Well. And I guess the way to think about is right now is that the fact if our applications like they are right now are on par with last year and my retention continues to improve, it's already improved. But if it continues to improve, I think you're going to see occupancy not only stabilized, but possibly start to improve. If our demand continues at this pace and our applications start running above last year with stronger retention, I think you're going to see this portfolio come back to that 96% level and start kind of optimizing revenue there. But I think it's still a little bit too early to understand because we really need some of these shelter in places to be lifted to truly understand the longer term kind of demand or impact on traffic for us to kind of optimize revenue offer. Well, so I think the improvement in traffic is really telling, right compared to where we were even in the beginning of the month and where we are right now. And then our closing ratios is kind of giving us that sense of this market clearing price. And if I backed up all the way to March, I'll tell you, I mean we're looking at how many eyeballs were hitting the website, what was that traffic count looking like? And we were closing 70% to 80% of everybody who expressed interest, so it was not a price issue back then. And right now as you can see, okay, we have an opportunity to kind of make an impact with the traffic improvement that we're seeing and we're going to continue to do what we're doing with promotion base to go forward and try to recover some of what we gave back in the last 45 days. But I think it's really the improving trends is what you got to focus on. Because again, the peak leasing season is not going to exist like the peak leasing season has in the past. It's probably going to shift forward a few months or it may just be kind of more dulled throughout the whole thing. We don't know that yet. So what we're watching is week-over-week. Are we seeing the improving traffic? Are we seeing the improvement in apps like you would expect to see through a leasing season? And so far that's what's been playing out for the last several weeks for us. And again, just to add to that just a little bit, John, we have the security deposits that we need to apply against this amount. It's not appropriate to apply it against the delinquency. Now you usually by law do it when a resident moves out or near that time or with the residents agreements. So we do have a little bit of an offset there that we need to figure out, but there certainly be more delinquency. Bob, I think maybe you give a little color on what was delinquency in the great financial crisis. Is that helpful, John, giving you a little bit of a frame of reference? Thank you. Yes, so I think this is Michael again. So I think we're now looking at kind of months like August and September renewal offers. And I think, each market always was done strategically with different kinds of parameters being set for kind of how we would issue kind of renewal offers. So I would expect, that there will be markets that will maintain kind of a no increase option for and then there'll be markets that we start going back to kind of tiring approaches and see kind of what those results are. Well I think our closing ratios tell us kind of whether or not we're kind of taking more market share. I mean historically we would run against what we used to call foot traffic, but that's got a whole new definition now with virtual leasing. But people that express interest do historically would close somewhere in that 20% range for people that express interest take tours with you. And right now that's kind of what we've been balancing off. So when we're closing 30%, 35% we're getting more than kind of the normal share of those applicants. No, I think I would say the impact from what we experienced at the tail end of March and April is really what brought kind of this occupancy down. Right now, even when you look at, call it the 900 applications that we had last week, call it 60% plus of them are moving in before May 22. So that's going to help kind of balance. So in the world of yield management, I mean you're optimizing revenue, you're trading off occupancy and rate and you're balancing this and that demand part of the equation is going to say whether or not you're going to optimize revenue at 95%, 95.5% or if you're going to kind of continue on this path, maybe you bounce back and start optimizing back at 96%. But I still think it's too early to understand where that sweet spot is for these portfolios. Yes, sure. So it was \u2013 it was almost in every single market that we looked at. We can see that relationship and some of this just has to do with where our kind of rent to income ratios. So it wasn't surprising, right. When you think about Seattle being the lowest, while Seattle also has our lowest rent as a percent of income. And when you go to LA it was the highest percent of income. And those are markets like, when you start looking at that, where we absolutely had more garden style property versus the high-rise property. But that relationship held true across all of our markets. So I guess I will just start by saying first we have a whole group of individuals that are focused on what does it look like to be operating in the new normal. So that starts with looking at all of our existing common area space and understanding how are we going to guarantee the safety and wellbeing of our employees as well as our residents, once these spaces start to open up and operate. And I think that there's occupancy limits, there's spacing and fitness center, there's a lot of complexity to this and each one of our jurisdictions is going to have different kind of rules that we'll be applying to our operations as we think about opening up. But longer-term as we think about the fact that residents may be working from home more, it does create an opportunity for us to look at our common areas spaces and look at any of our available spaces that we may have in our properties and think about how do we make some adjustments to that to allow them the opportunity to work from home as well as adhere to social distancing. So I think you'll see us start to get creative with how we're using spaces going forward to allow for more of that to occur. Well, most of us in this room were, so we remember that unfortunate event distinctly. First off, I'd say our portfolio compared to the 2008 great financial crisis is very similar. When you go all the way back to 2001 it's a very different portfolio. So when you think about what lessons we would pull out of that, when that happened, of course it also created this \u2013 which led to the next problem, created a big boom in purchasing single family homes. And so our markets like Phoenix, where we owned at that point, really suffered. I don't know how to think about that. Again, rates are really low, but mortgage capital is not that loose. So I appreciate that there are similarities both to the GFC and to the 9/11, because 9/11 was much more of that existential shock like COVID is, but our portfolio was so different, it's hard for me to draw some lessons to share with you. Thank you. Yes. So the answer for all question, I guess the long-term impact will depend on kind of what bad debt turns out to be John, right. So we're not providing guidance, but that will factor in deferral, you would recognize your revenue in a normal course. The question is what bad debt ends up being on that piece. Certainly we will be impacted by fee revenue or lack of fee revenue potentially with lower applications and some of tax in our markets, but it's hard to \u2013 it's not a meaningful part of the overall top line, so it's not a huge impact. Yes. Debt delinquency is just to tell you where we've charged revenue but haven't received cash. So over time, to be very specific and this will be a discussion with our auditors and the audit committee, and we'll think about this, because again we're fortunate not to be either familiar with delinquency, alright. So we'll get into June and July and we'll look at these folks and we'll see if they're performing per the payment plans, if they're still in the units and we'll write things off and that will run through revenue. That's where bad debt runs through revenue. And then there'll be a number of people that will effectively have this receivable outstanding and we'll be getting paid on it. And we'll be hopefully just as transparent as we are right now with you about all those numbers, whether it be write-off, whether it remains in the account receivable and what's the status of the payments we've received on delinquent accounts. Yes, so we did, well. First of all, we've always had the option to pay rent with a credit card, it's just that there were fees associated with that processing fees. So through the process of our conversations, we are allowing residents to pay their delinquent balance with a credit card and we would absorb the processing fee. It just is not a material number at all, right now. The fees are well below even a $100,000 kind of level. The other thing, Alex, we've been wondering about, and we don't know. As Mark said, the biggest question mark is just when do the stay at home orders get lifted? And when do people feel comfortable getting out there and looking for apartments and doing virtual tours. I mean there's going to be more distancing, but are they going to feel comfortable doing a self-guided tour in our property on their own, but they're able to see the site. Those are more efficient. Those are good marketing techniques. That will improve closing. So we're trying to balance all that. We've also done some extensions of people into the fall. Those people probably want to go somewhere, and it's probably true that there's other people and other apartment owners' portfolios. So we wonder about whether the lease \u2013 this isn't a leasing season different than any other, where it might go \u2013 might be as high a peak, but kind of go a little bit longer into the shoulder season a bit. But that's a little speculation on our part we're trying to sort out, because again, we and no one else has been through this before. So right now, I will tell you, we're not changing our models, our criteria for underwriting residents. I mean we have a strong resident base, and I think that's proven some of the benefits out right now. And I think we're going to continue down that path. Obviously, if the demand profiles totally change through the summer and all that, we can revisit that and pull some levers and make some changes. But at this point, we don't expect to do that. Yes. I think just to give some color to that. Obviously, our on-type, they're working really hard. And I think I said this before, this is difficult, right, because it's heavy lifting to go after some of these delinquent balances because you have to have the ear, you have to have the tone of empathy, but you also have to reinforce the obligations that sit with this stuff. So we have outreach programs, right, for folks that we haven't heard from. We're trying to do well-being checks on many of our residents that we haven't heard from as well. And the term ghosting is we've left some messages, we've sent some e-mails, and we've gotten zero response back from those folks. And again, I think Mark alluded to it. It's a small subset of this group that we're dealing with. But eventually, we have to have some conversations with these folks. Goon silent. I mean some of the markets; we're putting some notices on the door to make sure because we will enter to make sure that it hasn't been vacated on us, and that is part of a process, but that is one of the things that we would be doing. No. So, everybody basically since March 15 has had flexibility to move to any term at no increase at no increase. We basically froze rents regardless of term and now, we're starting to pivot and change off of that. And that was our way to kind of help people through these unprecedented times, people that were really nervous about moving. We wanted to give them the opportunity to just stay. So I think the peak leasing season, like we all knew it, is definitely impacted from this. We just don't understand yet how that impact is going to play out. So, this is Michael. Maybe I'll start with just kind of the impact on the operations. I will tell you, I think you've heard us talk a lot about what we were doing from a sales process and all the initiatives that we were teeing up before all this. I think this was an accelerator to us. I think this just advanced a lot of the things that we were already kind of teeing up and thinking about. I think it added a new layer with this virtual leasing and having kind of high-content video available, doing FaceTime kind of live tours. That's a new element to the sales process. And I think going forward, we're going to continue to have all of the above available as our sales process. It's just another tool kind of that we'll have available to close leases and applications. As far as the tech investment side goes, this did not change the tech investment that we were thinking about from the service side of the business. We already deployed that mobile kind of software. And I'll be honest with you, that was a huge advantage for us in this. It allowed our team to quickly pivot to focus on urgent service requests only. We had complete transparency at the top of the house as to what was happening all the way down to an individual tech. So we knew what needed to get done all from your mobile device. That was a big win. On the sales side of the business, we've already made most of the investments in the technology that we're going to need to run. I think the biggest thing that was out there is you heard us talk about making some investment into the smart home technology, where we were getting ready to move forward with about 10,000 units this year. We already have about 2,500 units deployed. I think that's one of the areas that we'll probably pause, and we're going to see the next-gen of technology come out that probably won't have keypads that will be Bluetooth-enabled. There's already some of this technology available. But we'll just wait to see it kind of get vet out a little bit, and then we'll continue to move forward with that. But I think as you think about operations going forward, it is very clear that contactless, touch-free, those are kind of things that are going to be with us in this environment, not only immediately but probably even longer term in this world of new normal. And Bob, maybe you want to just hit on the retail? Yes. So first, it's 60% of the applications last week are scheduled to move in before May 22, not May 12. And I think from a behavior standpoint, as you think about the duration, I think this is the time of the year, right, where you have a lot of people looking to lease future months. Their leases are expiring. That's typically what you see in a peak leasing season. And I think we're seeing that. We're seeing demand for June still, and we're seeing some of our notice to vacate or units that we will have become vacant in the future, those are being sold today; but not a huge change in their normal behavior."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I want to begin today by giving a big thank you to my Equity Residential colleagues for their dedication to serving our 150,000 residents during this difficult time. Whether working on-site performing essential maintenance or concierge duties, whether you're engaging remotely with prospects using our new touchless leasing process, or whether you are working from home in the many corporate roles that make Equity Residential hum, you are keeping our company rolling. So thank you very much Equity Nation for your amazing work. Now turning to our business. The best way I can describe it in the last seven weeks is resilient. In April, we collected in our residential business about 97% of the cash that we would usually collect. While no part of our country's economy will be immune from the coming recession, we feel that our portfolio of properties, populated with residents having average annual household incomes of $164,000 and often employed in technology and other knowledge industries, will fare relatively well. Our operations team has also shown resiliency. When the pandemic hit in full force in mid-March, Michael Manelis and his team quickly pivoted, and over a few week period, adjusted our leasing and service operations dramatically. On the leasing side, Michael and his team were able to quickly create a touchless process that made our customers comfortable to lease. And on the service side, we focused on essential maintenance tasks and cleanliness, which helped our existing residents feel safe and comfortable living with us through this pandemic. Michael will give you more details about all of this in a minute. When the lockdowns were initially announced, we saw our leasing activity decline significantly, but demand has since picked up, as we noted in the release. We see our recent pickup in demand as a further indication that our properties and markets will remain attractive places to live for our target demographic. All in all, we think our people and our properties have been resilient, with the capital R going through this crisis. We do fully acknowledge that challenging days remain ahead and are taking steps to weather the storm and prepare for the post-pandemic world. We have further fortified our already strong balance sheet, as Bob Garechana will describe in a moment. We are also preparing in earnest for our properties to operate with fuller staffing as lockdowns across the country are relaxed. We will keep in mind the safety of our employees and residents as we reengineer our business. Equity Residential has historically performed well in these downturns, and we would expect this to be no exception. We are optimistic that we will perform well operationally given these circumstances and that we will find opportunities to add high-quality assets for our platform as the economy works its way through this recession. Finally, we did withdraw guidance in the release. We are unable to estimate with precision the continuing impact of the pandemic and the timing and character of the reopening process on our business. It makes it impossible for us to give you the high-quality estimates of where our business might go in the near-term that you're used to receiving. We did provide a significant amount of information on April's preliminary results and hope that is helpful. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael. And I just want to add, Nick, it's Mark. As you think about building delinquency going forward, you also have to think a little bit, we do have significant security deposits that we haven't applied in any of these analyses. So generally speaking, you take the security deposit when the resident moves out, but that's a matter of local law. So we do have a significant amount of security deposits against these obligations. Michael has entered into a bunch of payment plans that the company has, and there'll be more of those. So I don't disagree that the economy will get worse before it gets better. But I'd also say we do have these other offsets, both on the security deposit side and with these payment plans, and we'll just have to feel our way through it. And I'll just add, I mean, if we're \u2013 again, we did withdraw guidance. So I know you're trying to feel your way through that, so we'll give you a few other building blocks. Our general instinct here is that our expense numbers will be lower this year than we thought, not higher. So these cleanliness and other costs aren't zero, but they're not that significant. And the overtime, the less routine maintenance that's being done because things are being deferred, all of that is more material. And so over time, again, you could have certain events occur in markets, weather-related or otherwise. But absent that, our general sense is that the expenses will remain pretty tight and this is not going to blow a hole in the expense number for us. Yes. There isn't a lot going on right now. I mean, the last seven weeks with the pandemic, again, talking to the brokers, talking to potential sellers, there really isn't anything institutional grade in our markets that's priced and closed or is even very far along in that process. So I don't have any markers there. As you relate to EQR, I mean we're always out there. We have teams in our markets, and it's their job to always be looking at purchase opportunities and such. But right now, there's just not a lot going on. Yes. Great question. We have a pause on it, but for a little different reason. Our residents don't really want contractors in the building, our contractors don't really want to go out right now with the shelter-in-place. So what you're going to see across our portfolio is a real slowdown in capital spending, including renovation. These projects that we've talked about on prior calls, we hope to begin those again. We'll be thoughtful about whether we can get the rents and all of that. But at this point, really, a lot of this capital spending depends on having people on-site. Those people aren't willing to come. And frankly, our residents are more comfortable with them not being there, so I think there's going to be a real slowdown there. Yes. That's a great question. It depends on where you are, so I'll start by saying that. So for example, in Boston, where we've got a tower we're building, the mayor closed construction March 17, and it still hasn't reopened, and that's the sort of city of Boston Rule. But outside the City of Boston in some of the suburbs, construction continues. So it's really place by place across the country. And I'd say there's more significant delays in places like Boston and New York in terms of places we do business and to a good extent, Seattle. There's less of a delay in D.C. and Southern California, where things have just kind of continued. And the delays you'll see in those places are people working in shifts. General contractors saying, you need to split your shifts up, we need more physical distance between workers. And so you'll see things slow down a little bit because of that. For example, when you look at our numbers and Axio's numbers for supply, shifting like what happened between our opinion at the end of 2019 and at the end of the first quarter of 2020 as to what 2020 supply would be, and in markets like Boston and New York, those numbers, we think, are going to move down, supply being lower in 2020 by upwards of 20%. In places like Southern California, it's more nominal, and the same with D.C. So it's very much a local law thing. Thank you. And just to add a little to that, we will start to adjust our renewal expectations, our asks, and we'll try and look at the market and see what we can get done. So as conditions start to normalize, we'll sort of feel our way through supply and demand conditions, and you will see us increase our renewal asks, I would expect mid to later in the year. Right now, we're making decisions in some markets as far out as August. So we've got to call that Nick, at some point, and make a judgment. And I'm just going to take a chance, Nick, to add a little bit to that answer. And that's we feel and we gave some extra disclosure about, at the moment, demand conditions. We like, on the occupancy side, the momentum we feel like we will pick up. It's certain \u2013 it's not certain. We have to see how these unwinds and these various stay-at-home orders go, but we would expect our occupancy to recover. And we feel good about that. And then you have, as Michael said, with the recession, and that will affect new lease and renewal and all the other quotes. But on the occupancy side, I think we've shown we're already having days where we have more move-ins than move-outs. We're already seeing all that occupancy stuff kind of steady. So as we see these markets open up, our hope is that, again, if it's done in an orderly fashion, and we don't slide back into a lockdown again, that we'll work our way out of occupancy, and then there'll be just the rate stuff to deal with. So I just want to emphasize, we feel pretty good about demand. Even in the pandemic, we're seeing good demand for our product. It's just a matter of figuring out the clearing price at the moment. Yes. And everything Michael said, absolutely agree with, but would add, we don't really understand the impact of the recession. I mean it is true that 20 million plus jobs are gone. It's hard for us to understand that impact on rate and on demand without all these stay at home orders being lifted and once that happens we'll have a better view for you. But yes, certainly our hope that given the strong demand we've seen while we're still in the shutdown, that we have stemmed the sort of occupancy bleed for the most part. And then we're just going to have to all-figure out what rate is in a recession like this. Thanks, Nick. Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, no problem. So it's a little bit of both, right. So I think when March 15, kind of rolls around, everybody that was scheduled to move out for the balance of the year, for the balance of the month based on lease expirations moved out, people that were scheduled to move in, some of those folks canceled, kind of those move-ins are deferred those move-in. And then we had, call it a couple of hundred of our units basically COVID specific reason leave early, early terminations. That's really the impact on the occupancy. Yes. Hey Rich, it's Mark. I start by saying the portfolio is similar but not the same as 2008, 2009, I mean we have a higher-end clientele as you acknowledged in your question. I like the income levels, I like the kind of employment our residents have, it doesn't mean they're immune to the recession that's coming, but I think there'll be less effective than some of the folks in hospitality and other industries got laid-off very quickly and suffered unfortunately very quickly in this recession. So I guess we feel now \u2013 I guess we do feel much better about our resident base. We think they've both got skills that will mean they'll be more readily employable. I mean we worry, I think a little bit about portfolios that depend on workers that have been \u2013 often how many of those workers are really getting those jobs back. In our portfolio, we just don't see that as much at this point. As I mean a few people won't lose their jobs in our resident base, but we think being tied to technology and some of these knowledge industry jobs is going to mean that our folks will have more employability, less layoffs coming through this recession. Wow. So just to make sure I understand your question Wes, is it mostly people have hardship issues that they can sort of document or is it folks that have just decided not to pay sort of the moral hazard issue? Is that the question? Yes, I guess that's a little hard to tell for us. Some of the residents haven't called us back and we don't have insight into their thought process not paying us. But that's a very small number for us given again the quality of the portfolio. We're talking about a pretty small number of accounts here. So I guess I'd say that most of the conversations that Michael has shared with me have been people saying, Hey, I need another week or two and then they pay it. So that's been most of the conversations that we've had to-date. I'd also point out that, there are people that may benefit from the checks that they'll receive from the government either through unemployment or through that federal supplementary payment. And I'm not sure how quickly all those are reaching people either. And that could be a benefit to us as well. So I don't \u2013 we don't have a breakdown or anything. We've got a few people that have ghosted us, but that's a pretty small number. And really it's, most people have been talking to us. I mean, working something out. Again, it's not more payment plans, it's often just give me another couple of weeks and I'll pay you the rent. That's been a more predominant conversation. And add to it isn't just markets, we priced by unit. So I mean in 2015 when things were great in the industry and great for our company and we had unit types there increases that we could get on renewals. And when you had bad years, like 2009 we had unit types that we did get increased on renewal. So it is a unit-by-unit thing. It is a market thing as it relates to maybe legal restrictions. But Michael and his team starting going forward are going to be looking at this saying, restrictions are removed. How do we now feel about supply and demand in the market and how are we going to think about this and that's kind of how we're expecting to play it. Great. So there's kind of two questions in that. Part of it I read is just when might we get active on the investment side and another is sort of a New York question, when that city might function a little better. And I guess I would start on the investment side by saying, as I said in my earlier remarks, there's just not a lot going on right now. We're seven weeks in, sellers still remember the price they would have gotten in early March and buyers think about the price they dream of getting right now and it's going to take a little while for that all to sort itself out. Some of the big deals that you might remember, we did we were quite active coming out of the great financial crisis. So purchasing the big portfolio in New York, and development land, and broken condos both on the East coast and the West coast those were all done 12 months to 18 months after the beginning of the great financial crisis. Those were fourth quarter, 2009 deals at the beginning and then into 2010. When you think about that crisis, the GFC really being at 2000 \u2013 mid-2008, third quarter of 2008 events. So I'll tell you, it's going to be a little while before we really see much to act on. So, I start with that. And the way we are sort of thinking about opportunity is trying to think about replacement costs a little bit, trying to think a little bit about what long-term growth will be in this market, did anything change that matters? And we think and this sort of gets into your New York question a little bit. We think these big cities and I'll focus a little on New York, are really quite resilient. I mean New York been through, as you're quite aware, riots, it's been through wars, it's been through epidemics before, it's been through 9/11 and after 9/11 there's a lot of comment that New York wouldn't come back and people would decamp from New York in size. And yet, New York had a terrific urbanization trend over the last 20 years and the population in New York city was higher in 2016 than it was in 2001. So I think every morning, millions of owners of businesses throughout the country are waking up trying to figure out how to run their restaurant, their cultural amenities, their nonprofit, their restaurant, whatever. And they're going to figure that out over time and we're going to have new rules about distancing and cleanliness, then over time, hopefully there's some cure to this and we don't have this top of mind, but I think these cities are going to adjust like they always have. And I think you could expect that we'll still be focused in our investment efforts on these large cities and these dense suburban areas for our apartment investment. Yes, same. You stay well. Great. So I'm going to repeat that back to make sure I understood it. You had a question about where cap rates might end up through this and then investor interest in some of these less dense markets like Denver. The first, the Denver question or the investor interest question. As we look at that, it's just again, a little early for us to sort that out. I think some types of trades like for example, the value-add trade may be less attractive. I think you're going to have a hard time doing your renovations, you're going to have hard time jacking up \u2018rents, all of those things. And a lot of the value-add deals that were done just before the pandemic are likely to perform pretty poorly. So my sense is that you're going to see investor interest get sorted out. And I think, and we've talked about this in the last call. Cap rates had really compressed between all these markets and I think as you go through this recession and you get past some of this government stimulus, you're going to see people with better resident basis like ours perform better. And you're going to see those cap rates on those properties be more durable than cap rates than it's sort of come down on B and C quality stuff and in lesser markets and have lesser employment basis than the ones we're in. So that is our sense of things in terms of where cap rates end up. Part of this is of course a function of interest rates and rates are incredibly low, but there's also a limiter because of replacement costs. So I think there's a bunch of things going on with cap rates. It wouldn't surprise me if cap rates in two or three years weren't lower, than they were before the pandemic because of the interaction of interest rates. My sense that the apartment sector and our company in particular will perform better than most other real estate and that there'll be more capital attracted to the area. And then you just got to think about replacement costs, because you'd be careful about paying big premiums to replacement costs no matter what interest rates are when you buy an asset. So I guess I look through it and say, wouldn't surprise me if cap rates were lower in a few years than what they are now for those reasons. Yes, I'm not sure we're going to give quite that level of detail. I think that's just probably more than we have at our fingertips. Thank you. And I would say even the fact that we've been waiving late fees, that's a short-term kind of impact and even those dollars are not that significant. So if a resident is on \u2013 a tenant on the nonresidential side is on a deferral program, you're still going to recognize the revenue unless you believe the revenue is not collectible, at which point you're going to reserve against the revenue or take a bad debt expense against that revenue line items. So all sheer nature of having deferral doesn't necessarily mean that you're not going to recognize the revenue. It's all about collectability. Yes, that's really encouraging because that shows you that our residents aren't living hand to mouth and having to put a month credit card on their credit card or rental payment. So we think that's encouraging from our point of view. Thank you John. Thank you. Hey, Alex, it's Mark. I guess I'm going to take issue with the idea that our delinquency is high. I mean, I \u2013 again you're talking about a company with $220-plus million, a monthly residential revenue that in \u2013 what is the worst panic of our lifetimes? Maybe as $5 million of rent we're chasing around and making progress on. So I don't feel like this is a big number of people. I'm more concerned, frankly, about the recession than I am about delinquency in our portfolio. Listen, we've got high-level credit tenants. These obligations aren't going away. We're not going anywhere. So these are folks that value their credit that know they're receiving a great service. I mean I'm lucky I get to read all the feedback that our residents right on our teams on site. And that feedback, Alex, has been really good. They really appreciate that our people, our frontline workers at EQR are keeping the property clean, are maintaining all the essential parts of the building so they can shelter-in-place. They don't look at this rent as something they need to avoid, they don't \u2013 we're not ripping them off, we're taking care of them in a crisis. So I guess, I'd say I think our resident mindset, at least as far as I can tell is very different than the sort of resident mindset you're describing. Are there a few people that are taking advantage of the system and creating this moral hazard? Absolutely. And that's just playing on. I mean we're turning around and paying their rent in property taxes to these hard press municipalities, to our hard-working frontline workers. I mean that's just wrong, but I'll tell you, we're not going to stop being persistent pursuing them. We'll follow the law, but they owe the rent. And sooner or later, there will be a discussion about that. So I guess I'd put it to you that way. Well, I guess I would just start by saying New York, one, it's always had the strongest retention in the portfolio, but it absolutely is seeing an improved retention with renewals at that 70% level. We've never experienced that in the city. So a lot of our residents are staying put. And it's not like they're just staying for a month or two months, they're renewing at those 12-month terms. As far as the front door, that's a really tough thing to answer right now because it's not rebounding yet like the other markets have, which understandably, it's the hardest hit from the COVID. So I think we need to see a little bit of the public health crisis kind of soften or dampen a little bit in New York to get a feel as to what the new folks coming in are saying and what they're looking for and everything else like that. But I think the retention side of it, short term, is a positive for us. Thanks. Stay well. Thanks for that comment, and I'm going to hand it over to Michael because we've used that term, he and I between us, and maybe that needs more definition. No. We're definitely not there yet. I guess I can give you a little bit of context. So first and foremost, in the beginning of March, we changed some of our parameters inside these yield management applications to just lessen the volatility of pricing to begin with. On March 20th, we actually stopped generating prices from the pricing engine. We turned it off in essence and just let all of our prices stay as they were regardless of lease term, regardless duration of lease as well. So at that point, now we're watching and we're seeing the kind of the application \u2013 or the traffic come back and the application volume come back. So just a couple of weeks ago, we started to reinitialize kind of that LRO or the yield management application to start sending out the daily price changes as well. So I don't know exactly, I think I said this before, where we'll optimize kind of revenue, what level of occupancy it is and what rate decline you'd allow. I think demand is going to tell you where \u2013 what that market clearing price needs to be. But I think you can see right now, I alluded to the fact that the base rents are down 4%, and we're closing at a higher percentage of what we normally would be. So that, to me, feels like the right level today, and we'll just see where the demand levels are going forward. I mean, so our unconsolidated joint ventures at the moment are really just one asset that's it's a garage parking kind of... Got it. Yes. It's a very de-minimis amount. Happy to give you more color, and Marty or I could give you more color about it. But it's a very small percentage. And it's also; I think there's more disclosure in the 10-Q \u2013 in the footnotes in the 10-Q. We just stopped including a whole page in the supplemental of the press release. But in the 10-Q, we can point you to some color on that. Hey Haendel. Yes. So I'm going to start, it's Mark, and Michael is going to supplement here. This is more of us looking at small sample sizes and seeing a little shifting and trying to figure out the conduct of our customer in this kind of hairy situation. So I can't tell you, we're sure that demand will be flattened out. It will just be longer. That's just; again, we have a few of those. Michael, by turning on the pricing machine, has already begun doing something. We don't want to do six month leases now and have expirations in the late fourth quarter. So to incentivize us to do that, we are going to raise your rent. If you want a renewal for a one-year term on like-term, we'll do that flat. So I guess, Haendel, we're going to still manage our expiration schedule, but there are a few people who took shorter term and our portfolio and we're guessing others, shorter term extensions in March and April because listen, no one was in a position to really move and so you may see some of those people turn around and go, okay, now I'm ready. It's August and they would have been ready instead in April or May, right. So there may be a little bit of a shift, but it's not fully discernible, I'd say at this point. Sure. A lot there to unpack. And I certainly think very thoughtful. And I mean, it is an evolving situation. No doubt, this is a 100-year event, we hope, and we're going to go all go through it together and figure it out. I was trying to get to this thought process about vibrancy and flexibility that these big urban areas have gone through a lot before, and they'll figure this out too in ways that we can't yet determine. And you talked just a little bit. And I wonder about that, Michael, about corporate preferences versus individuals. And people could probably always live in different places and telecommute, and now they'll be able to telecommute even more. I agree with that part of it. But our sorts of people, these affluent renters, they like living in these urban and dense suburban places. And right now, they're thrown off a little because we're all trying to figure out how do you run New York City with more social distancing and cleanliness. Is it shift? So how does that all work? But every day, millions of people are waking up trying to figure out how to do that, how to run the transit systems and the restaurants and all of that. So I guess I'd say, I'm certainly not of the mind that that's something you abandon very quickly, that all of a sudden, we're all moving to ex-urban and rural settings. That doesn't make sense to me that the preference for young affluent renters like we have to live in these cities among their peers is pretty durable and pretty strong. So I guess I don't deny this is unprecedented, but I guess I'd answer by saying the companies may allow more teleworking and almost certainly will, us include. But I think residents \u2013 or excuse me, employees will still choose where they care to reside. And I think our markets will still be very attractive to them and that the denser solutions, especially as we work through new ways to be clean inside buildings and the distance inside buildings, that will kind of work itself out over time. So I guess that's \u2013 I'm not sure if that's the house view, but that's the sort of EQR view. And I think Sam has been on record very recently in a big broadcast about the strength of the residential business. So I think we feel good about our business model. Yes. I mean Michael had some comments on that. I mean we are trying to figure out how we can make our apartment buildings even more comfortable as these common areas open up in this new distancing and cleanliness environment. I think that's something that we're working on right now. And you're right to ask about, and I think we want to make our properties attractive for people to spend more hours per day than they probably have in the past, at least for a while. And the good news is you've been in a lot of our buildings. They have terrific amenities. They have terrific \u2013 most of them have just terrific lounges and large roof decks in places where you can be home but be outside your unit for a period of time and still feel safe. So I think that's something we'll market. And again, we've got to get the cleanliness and the safety thing right as an industry, and we will. And then I think you'll have the advantage of being at-home but outside your unit and will feel good to our residents. Great question. I can't give you certainty on any of this. I'll just say that, so far, we've seen demand even in lockdown start to head up again already. I mean it seems to us that our demographic, and this is anecdotal, I have a daughter who's college age. I know a lot of kids in their mid-20s, and they don't want to live with their parents anymore. They want to go back to the big cities and be in their apartments and live their lives again. So I guess I'd be more anxious about owning a bunch of apartment buildings in Orlando or Miami, where they're hospitality-dependent, that's closed down and you wonder, how many people who work at airports and hotels and theme parks and cruise lines will ever come back to work. I think that's a pretty salient question to ask. I think you're right, there's \u2013 these telecommuting options will be more available to people. But I think people didn't live in Brooklyn because it was cheap, people live in Brooklyn because they love the cultural amenities, they love the restaurants and all that stuff's closed down. And now everyone's figuring out how to reopen it, and I think it will reopen and over a period of time, as you suggested, and make those submarkets that we operate in continue to be pretty attractive. Stay healthy. Appreciate the big questions. Thank you. Well, I just would ask you to spread the word. I \u2013 listen, I think what we were trying to get across in the release, besides this general feeling of empathy and concern for our communities, which are going through hell and back right now is that we did pretty well in April. We did pretty well as a company in the midst of this pandemic. And when you look long term, a lot of what just happened with COVID, doesn't \u2013 you don't look at our strategy and go, that doesn't make sense, like you do some other real estate sectors. Our strategy makes a lot of sense. But in between then and now is this recession, and we're all going to go through that, and we're going to see how it goes. Our company has been pretty resilient through those. We've come out of it historically faster and better. So I think we just need to make our case and continue to be effective and transparent. And we're confident investors over time, and smart analysts like you will pick it up and people will see the opportunity. So I guess we think about running the business long term, and investors will respond to it over the long run. Thank you. All credit to Bob and his team. So thank you for that. Well, we thank you all for your time today, and we hope everyone stays healthy. Good day. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. This morning, I'll highlight our enhanced disclosure from last night's release, give a brief update on non-residential operations and end with our incredibly well-positioned balance sheet. Starting with our new disclosures. We've modified our disclosures to help better present our business and where it stands today. We do so by providing April operational and collection statistics, by breaking out our same-store performance between residential and non-residential, a practice that we would expect to continue as the performance from our main residential business, which makes up approximately 96% of total revenues, is likely to diverge meaningfully in the upcoming quarters for our much smaller non-residential business. This includes modifying the schedules on Pages 10 through 12 of the release. And finally, by providing an update on liquidity and balance sheet information. In order to accomplish this, we've defined a number of key terms in the back of the release. We hope that these definitions will provide specificity and clarity to our disclosure. Part of the new disclosure includes a breakout of non-residential operations for our same-store portfolio. This is a modest component of our business at 4% of total revenues and consists mostly of ground floor retail and public non-resident parking at our well-located apartment communities. Ground floor retail makes up about two-thirds of this 4% with public non-resident parking making up the rest. As you would suspect, a good portion of the retail tenants that rent our space have been significantly impacted by shelter-in-place orders. This is evidenced by the 58% April collection rate for all retail that we disclosed, which, while certainly below what we would have hoped, may be higher than many other retail landlords. The drugstores, bank branches and national chains that occupy a good portion of these spaces have, for the most part, continued to pay rent, while local small business owners have struggled. With non-resident parking, we've seen an approximately 30% decline in parking volume for April, given the lack of public events and increased work-from-home arrangements. We suspect that this may recover as shelter-at-home orders are eventually lifted. Finally, a few highlights on our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with an incredibly strong net debt to normalized EBITDA of 4.9 times and nearly $1.8 billion in liquidity under our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we improved this already strong position by closing on a very attractively priced 2.6% or $195 million 10-year GSE loan and by closing on the sale of an asset in the San Francisco Bay Area. With these steps, we sit here today with over 84% of our total NOI unencumbered, about $150 million in commercial paper outstanding and readily available liquidity of over $2.2 billion under our revolving credit facility, which does not mature until 2024. This liquidity is more than sufficient to address our modest level of anticipated development spend, minimal debt maturities in 2020 and to address our next significant debt maturity, which isn't until December of 2021. Our balance sheet is in excellent condition to weather the storm and take advantage of opportunities should they present themselves. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator. Yes. It's Bob. And I'll give you a little bit of color to that. So if you think about March and kind of the regular or the pre-COVID delinquency levels, it's very uncommon or would have been very uncommon to have any level of deferral of rental payments. Typically, you would have ended a month at 2% to 3% of delinquency and then through the regular process of having conversations and collecting that rent, et cetera, that would have diminished to the point in time where it converted to a financial statement impact, which would have been write-offs of bad debt, et cetera. And that number would have been something more like 50 basis points of, call it, total income. So very uncommon in this business to have a material amount of delinquency or payment plans, if you will. Obviously, the situation has changed modestly with the COVID-19 and pandemic implications. I think that's a hard question to answer in all fairness. We haven't seen those kinds of levels historically, right. So like I said, this business was very fortunate and has been very fortunate to see very little delinquency historically. So I'm not sure that ratio of that I talked about between 2% to 3% converting itself ultimately to 50 basis points necessarily holds true in the middle of a pandemic. I do think that all the positives that we have in our resident base that Mark outlined in terms of high-quality employment, et cetera, should help in the collections process, but hard to guess any answer to that one right now. Yes. I mean my \u2013 and that kind of gets towards the kind of bad debt expense policy or kind of what policy we have in terms of write-offs, et cetera. And I think that's something that in the second quarter we will evaluate with a lot more detail about at what point do you reserve against some of these outstanding deferral programs and payment programs, because certainly there will be some subset of residents that are subject to a payment program that ultimately don't pay. That's something that we're currently evaluating and currently discussing as we have just simply a lack of historical payment history to understand because of the unprecedented nature. So I think you're correct in assuming that, it'll \u2013 that is to be told as how it manifests itself in the financial statements. Yes. Delinquency and I'm sorry and bad debt expense. So I'll talk maybe the bad debt expense to give you a frame of reference. So I mentioned earlier that in normal kind of environment, so not in the great financial crisis, we run about 50 basis points of total. In 2009, which would have been the worst year of the great financial crisis that 50 basis points converted itself to slightly over 100 basis points. Let me make sure I understand the question kind of frame of reference and I'm going to rephrase it and hopefully this answers your question. It's Bob here, Rich. So the 97% is measured half of March, rental payments. In March we had higher occupancy, right. So then we did in April, so if anything, it probably understate that 97% probably understates what the collection percentage is as a whole. Does that answer your question? That is correct. Yes. No. The retail and non-residential pieces, we've always focused on minimizing that exposure. We've focused on investing in high-quality apartment buildings, right? We're an apartment company, so that hasn't changed. That's how we ended up with the limited exposure that we have here today. So I don't think from a strategy standpoint, that's going to change at all. In our markets, particularly in the urban areas, there is typically, with these high-quality assets, some exposure to retail."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Equity Residential Four Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\nMarty McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's full year 2021 results and outlook for 2022. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. I will now turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thanks Marty. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. This morning, I'll make some remarks about what we see driving our operating results and cash flow growth this year and going forward. And I will comment on our capital allocation program and what the company will look like when it's complete. After that, Michael Manelis will review our operating performance and outlook for 2022 same-store revenue. Bob Garechana will spend a few moments discussing our innovation activities and their impact on our business. And then we'll go ahead and take your questions. We're very excited about the prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. Our affluent resident base is well employed and receiving healthy raises and they are renewing with us at record levels. The robust demand for Apartment Living in both urban and suburban locations is driving high occupancy and the lowest resident turnover in our history. Our same-store revenue guidance calls for 9% growth at the midpoint, while our normalized funds from operations should grow at about 15%. Both of which would be the best performance in our history. Cash flow from our business is likewise poised to grow strongly. We see this at the beginning of what should be a good run of performance as we welcome the 67 million member strong Generation Z to the rentership world, and as we continue to attract and retain millennials, with our flexible product offerings and a price point that is increasingly affordable relative to surging single-family housing costs. That said, we are aware of the recent storm clouds on the horizon in the general economy, which include high inflation and related concerns about how the Federal Reserve will manage short-term rates in its balance sheet as well as continuing supply chain disruptions and unfortunately, the latest COVID variant. While we are not immune to these pressures, a considerable amount of our expected 2022 revenue growth is already baked into our results in the form of leases recently signed at higher rates as well as an expectation that even if rental rates do not rise in 2022, resetting leases to current market levels will provide a significant revenue boost. In 2023 and beyond, our ability to reset lease rates annually should create a natural hedge in a more inflationary world. We also continue to successfully execute on our expense control management with 3% growth in 2021 and a midpoint expectation of 3% growth in 2022 despite the impact of inflation on many costs in the economy. We run an incredibly efficient platform and continue to harness technology to control expenses, enhance the customer experience and grow our operating margin. Bob will comment on all of this in a moment. Switching over to investments. We had a very active year on that side of the business, with $1.7 billion each in acquisitions and dispositions as well as progress in ramping up our development activities. We continue to optimize our portfolio by successfully recycling out of older assets and deploying capital into newer assets in our expansion markets and the suburbs of our established markets. Our 17 acquired properties have an average age of two years as compared to our 14 disposition assets with an average age of 30 years, and we're recycling all this capital while not diluting earnings. Our 2021 transaction activity on both the buy and sell-side was done at an average cap rate of approximately 3.8%. In 2022, we expect to both sell and buy approximately $2 billion in assets. Our acquisition activity is focused on building out our portfolios in Atlanta, Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver and Austin as well as adding select assets in the suburbs of our existing markets. We continue to see great opportunities in our markets and expect to deploy $2 billion into them in 2022. On the development front, we commenced construction on approximately $450 million in development projects during 2021 and expect to deliver high-quality properties in Denver, suburban New York and Central Washington, D.C. in several years. We also completed the construction of our $400 million Alcott Tower in Central Boston during the quarter, and we're pleased to report that the lease-up is going very well. In terms of the development pipeline. In the quarter, we entered into four separate development joint ventures, in Texas and in Colorado with the Colorado joint venture beginning construction in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the other three expected to do so in 2022. These three parcels are the first in our development program with Toll Brothers. As we have discussed with you before, we are reshaping our portfolio to reflect the demand trend we see of some affluent renters spreading out from the coast and congregating in markets like Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and Denver. We also see a similar but more local dispersion trend in our coastal markets as another group of higher income renters move to the suburbs of our established markets like Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle; and Burlington, Massachusetts near Boston. Now we've always had a presence in the suburban submarkets of our established markets. So what I'm talking about here is just creating a little more balance between urban and suburban markets. We will also continue to have a substantial investment in the urban centers of our markets, and those will continue to attract, we think, high-quality renters seeking to enjoy the many amenities of urban living. Driven by our analytical research and informed by our long experience in the apartment business, we seek to build and buying newer assets in urban and suburban locations in these markets where we see demand from higher renters as being high and likely to grow where single-family housing is expensive relative to renting and where supply is manageable. We expect our refined portfolio to have about one-third of its assets in the three Northeastern markets of Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., with a reduction in exposure coming from New York and Washington, D.C. dispositions. We see approximately one-third or maybe a bit more of the portfolio being in California with divestments there occurring in challenging regulatory locations and of older assets. The remaining third or so of the company will be concentrated in a diagonal from Seattle through Denver, to Austin and Dallas, Texas and over to Atlanta, Georgia. We think this distinct portfolio of newer, less capital-intensive assets in the 12-or-so most desirable metros for more affluent renters to live will provide high and stable long-term returns. We also see reduced regulatory risk and resiliency benefits from this portfolio shift. And finally, before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to give a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You are doing an exceptional job during very unusual times, and we're all very proud and grateful. We're in position for a great 2022, and I look forward to delighting our customers and our investors with you. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark. This morning, I will provide highlights on how we finish the year and give you some color on 2022 revenue guidance and market performance. So first, a big thank you to our teams across the country who have worked so hard during these trying times to deliver these results and are all geared up to make 2022 a terrific year for Equity Residential. The recovery continues despite the presence of the Omicron variant and noise from uncertainty in back-to-the-office plans with tremendous demand to live at our properties, both urban and suburban. We see reopened restaurants, entertainment venues and other lifestyle amenities as attracting our affluent resident base without regard to continuing low office occupancy rates. Absent a government-mandated closure of businesses in cities, which we see is unlikely, the lifestyle that our residents crave is again available in most of our markets and our residents are voting with their feet and pocket books to be in these locations whether they anticipate working fully remote, hybrid or fully in the office. Interestingly, we see a little less of this trend in our tech heavy Seattle and San Francisco markets, which I will discuss in a moment. We are currently 96.5% occupied and are on track to deliver about 13.5% achieved new lease growth in January after posting just over 10.5% in the fourth quarter. We reported the lowest turnover in our history for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021 which reaffirms the desirability of our product as our resident signed renewals at record levels with increases that average nearly 11% in the quarter. In addition, our residents received $32 million in rent relief with $15 million of that received in the fourth quarter. This performance has positioned us well for 2022 and what we believe will be the best same-store revenue growth in our history. The majority of our 9% same-store revenue growth at the midpoint is coming from resetting existing leases at current market rates. As of January 1, 83% of our residents were paying on average rents that are about 11% below our current market prices. As we have discussed in the past, we won't be able to capture all of this loss to lease in 2022 because leases will reset over the course of the year either through new move-ins or renewals, and there are currently a few regulations that cap our allowable increases. In addition to capturing this reset, we are anticipating intra-year growth in rates that is more reflective of typical seasonal growth than the steep growth we experienced during the 2021 pandemic recovery year. Strong, continued physical occupancy, particularly relative to the comparably weaker period in early 2021 is also a contributor with the remaining growth projected to come from lower bad debt, improved nonresidential revenues and other income. So far, we continue to see strong retention with the percent of residents renewing expected to be just over 60% in both January and February. We may see some moderation from this high level as the year goes on. But interestingly, in Q4, we did not see much disparity in renewal percent for deal seekers, those residents who had a concession on their current lease versus non-deal seekers, meaning many of our residents are deciding to stay put regardless of the rent increase. While the world remains an uncertain place, we feel good about this expected pricing power, given our net effective pricing trend is currently 27% over 2021 levels and 7% over the same pre-pandemic week in 2020. A key driver of this improvement is the sizable reduction in concession use in our portfolio, which is nearly nonexistent with the exception of Seattle, that I will get to in a moment as I provide color on the markets and how they are expected to contribute to 2022. Beginning with Boston, which is following a normal seasonal pattern with improving demand and pricing heading towards the spring, overall, we're 96% occupied today with a drag from the urban core at 95.5 versus the remainder of the market, which is above 96%. With strong continued demand from lab and life sciences, financial firms, health care and education and very little competition from new supply, we expect this market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022. Another positive note is that we continue to see a return of international students and workers to the market. After a difficult period early in the pandemic, the quick turnaround of the New York market has been really amazing. We expect New York to be our best-performing market in 2022 with same-store revenue growth of approximately 13% despite some expected pressure from new supply on the Jersey waterfront in Brooklyn. Demand is very strong, and we have been renewing about 65% of our residents. Occupancy remains above 97%, rates continue to improve, concessions are not being used and pricing is currently 11% over pre-pandemic pricing levels. We expect that Washington, D.C. will be a solid performer in 2022, but will end up as one of our lower producing revenue growth markets at about 4%. This market held up the best of our East Coast markets during the pandemic, and so does not have the same ground to make up. This market also continues to deliver 12,000 or so new units each year, absorption of Class A multifamily has been really strong even during the pandemic, making us optimistic that this absorption trend will continue. Occupancy is steady at 97% and rental rates are following a slightly better-than-expected normal seasonal pattern here. Moving to the West Coast. Both of our tech heavy markets, Seattle and San Francisco, have been slower to recover than other markets. While there is certainly demand, the downtown submarkets are 93% and 96% occupied, respectively. The ambiguity and return to office by big tech employers and quality-of-life challenges are deferring a fuller recovery. We expect that the quality of life issues will improve through a combination of civic engagement and having more activated streetscapes. The tech companies have a role to play here as they balance their growth plans versus employee preferences or work from home in a highly competitive job market. It appears likely that the balance will be met by a hybrid work model which should benefit our business in these markets. But until there is more certainty, some employees will be hesitant to make housing decisions. Longer term, the overall drivers of demand remain positive and we would expect the urban centers of these markets to fully recover because they remain attractive to the many affluent renters that want to enjoy in urban lifestyle there. Also, the tech giants continue to accumulate large amounts of office space, whether through leases or whole building purchases, which indicates that their long-term plans involve some level of in office. We're optimistic about Seattle's recovery and expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022. Our expectations are predicated on the CBD, where we have a large concentration of assets recovering in the back half of the year. Demand is improving. Initial lead and tour volume has ramped up past 2021 levels but our on-site teams are reporting a lack of sense of urgency from potential renters to sign leases right now. Occupancy has rebounded slightly to just over 94.5%. This market is the primary user of concessions in our portfolio with currently about a third of our applications receiving on average just over one month free. Heading down to San Francisco, we are seeing good demand but do not yet have a lot of pricing power. We expect to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 7% in 2022. San Francisco continues to be the only market in our portfolio that has not gotten back to pre-pandemic pricing levels as we are currently 6% below the same week in 2020. Occupancy is holding steady at 96.5%, and we are renewing just under 60% of our residents. Los Angeles continues to be a solid performer with demand driven by a robust return of the online content industry. Occupancy is running at 97%, pricing power is strong. We expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 9% for the year. The percent of residents renewing is the highest we have seen likely due to the impact of local regulations. We expect to continue to renew 65% to 70% of our residents here. Both Orange County and San Diego continue to show remarkable performance with high occupancy and strong retention, supporting very good new lease rents. We expect these markets to produce same-store revenue growth of 10% or greater in the year. In Denver, we have very good demand and expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 9% in 2022. Occupancy is strong at 97%, and we're renewing about 50% of our residents. Lastly, a few thoughts on our additional expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Austin. So far, our newly acquired assets are performing well. Demand remains robust and occupancy levels are high. The expansion markets have seen good growth throughout the pandemic, and we expect that growth to continue in 2022. This is an exciting time for the industry and the overall operations of our company. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana.\nBob Garechana: Thanks, Michael. Rather than go through a detailed review of our guidance assumptions, which are laid out on Page 4 and Page 27 of the release. I thought I'd take a moment to elaborate on our approach to innovation, our continued investment in our platform and how that's playing out in our financial statements in 2022 and going forward. Over the last couple of years, we've had impressive results in our innovation journey, and it's not over. A few highlights that our property management and operations teams have been busy rolling out. We brought mobility to both the service and sales teams to enable and enhance flexibility. We have artificial intelligence handling 80% of our communication with prospects to lower cost and provide 24/7 service. We've deployed roommate matching functionality on our website to drive additional revenue, and we've moved 97% of our tours to self-guided or virtual, all while increasing our gross rent potential by using data and analytics to improve our amenity pricing. These are only some of the examples of how we continue to advance our efforts to maximize efficiencies on site and improve revenue while meeting the ever-evolving expectations of our residents. We have done so successfully through adjusting our processes, deploying new technology like the artificial intelligence I mentioned and through advancing our use of data to inform our business decisions. We have most visibly seen financial benefit from these endeavors and our ability to successfully minimize our on-site expense growth, particularly payroll. In 2021, we reported negative on-site payroll after reporting less than 1% growth in the prior two years, and we're just getting started. Our focus moving into 2022 continues to be building upon the success we've already achieved. That means continuing to improve our digital customer experience, our business processes and to advance our sophistication and data-driven decision-making tools. This is an area in which we have historically been a leader and expect to continue to excel at going forward. Our approach remains focused on efficiency, marries technology and data and should reduce exposure to expense pressures while increasing revenue growth. In order to accomplish this, we're making investments in foundational areas like centralized teams, IT infrastructure and licensing and data analytics, which is driving a good portion of our forecasted overhead growth in 2022. These investments enable our progress in our innovation journey and have significant ROI that should continue to garner margin improvement benefits in 2022 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to the operator for the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thank you very much. Maybe starting on the transaction side. Mark, you mentioned the $2 billion this year on acquisitions and dispositions, I think, at a 25 basis point dilutive cap rate. How are you thinking about that trade from an IRR growth perspective over the next few years? I know you're buying newer assets and selling older assets. So I just want to understand how you're underwriting that?\nAlec Brackenridge: Hey Nick, this is Alex Brackenridge. And yes, so we feel like the assets we're buying will have higher IRRs over time. It's a combination of both higher top line rent growth but also less capital demands over time as well. So we feel like we're in a point in time where we have an opportunity to have a really good trade of selling these older properties into newer properties in these markets that are very, very robust.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Are you seeing any difference in the buyer pool or competition for the assets that you're trying to buy versus what you're selling?\nAlec Brackenridge: Just that it keeps getting bigger. The multifamily is clearly a favorite asset class. And we see people that had gone away coming back. And certainly, in our coastal markets that were quiet or like New York, it's full bore. I mean people that we're investing only in office are now investing in apartment, people that went down south have come back north. So it's a competitive bid both for what we're selling and for what we're buying.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then just what does 2022 guidance assume for government rental assistance?\nBob Garechana: Hey Nick, it's Bob. We're roughly assuming maybe slightly below half of what we got in 2021. So in 2021, just to remind the group, we received about $34 million. And so we expect the programs to kind of start tailing off as we go. So about half of what we got in 2021.\nNick Joseph: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to take Nick\u2019s question a step further, Alec, just in terms of how your team is approaching underwriting intermediate-term growth. So if you went and sampled all the deals you've underwritten on the acquisition side in recent months or currently underwriting, would the intermediate-term NOI growth assumptions be higher or lower for the average Sunbelt deal versus the average Coastal acquisition?\nAlec Brackenridge: That's a hard question for me to answer in specific, as on every deal is a little different. Every rent roll, obviously, is different. There's a lot of still to be picked up rent growth in both what we're buying and selling. But you're getting it kind of in a different way and some of the things we're selling, there's still maybe some pandemic recovery. And what we're buying, generally, there wasn't a big pandemic downturn. But there's still \u2013 the market has moved so quickly. You still have leases under. So net-net, we feel really good about the short and medium-term growth of these expansion markets, but it's coming from a different source.\nMark Parrell: Hey John, it's Mark. Just to add to that. And the risks are different in each of these markets. So you get into the intermediate term with some of the markets that we call our established coastal markets. And there is a bit more risk of rent control and things like that interrupting rent growth in those markets. I'd also just say that when you look at the growth in some of these markets, we think of the new portfolio is having a bit of a handoff and this diversification is going to serve us well. We do have supercharged growth this year because of the recovery in our established markets. And as we establish the Sunbelt presence, we're going to have more balance. And I think you're going to see just more balanced growth. So maybe there is a little more growth in the Sunbelt and a little less in established, but we'll pick that up and vice versa. So from our perspective, it's sort of a risk-adjusted thought process and a diversification thought process. So maybe the established markets drive the machine for the next 18 months or two years and maybe some of these diversification markets help add power to the engine in outer years.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you for all thoughts. Final question. Michael, I'm not sure I fully understand why there's been such a large and persistent breakage between net effective pricing trend and the blended reported spreads. So since July, your effective pricing trends been \u2013 over 20% above the year prior. So I would have expected new and renewal \u2013 acknowledging they're very healthy, out of expected, new and renewal to be closer to 20% than 10% eventually. So I'm not sure if it's regulation or just more time is needed. Any comments there?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I think it's a little bit of both of those factors. So one, as that pricing trend improves, it's a lead indicator as to what to expect on that new lease change and renewal in those forward months. But I think clearly, you're subject to who's moving out and who's moving in, a little bit of the timing of when those original leases were written. And then clearly, we are subject to some of these regulations right now that are limiting our ability, mostly on the renewal side of the business with allowable increases which, in my mind, just defers kind of the rent growth that we were going to see in 2022 and pushes it more into 2023 because we're going to recapture that spread again either through that next renewal or at move out and time of a new lease coming in. So I think you're seeing, too, the trend, if you look at that January kind of trend. You're going to continue to see that growth in these first couple of months of this year with both new lease change and the blended. And then you'll start to see us come up against that comp in the back half of the year, and it will start to moderate a little bit. So I think you're seeing us close that gap with that net effective pricing trend, but I don't think you should ever expect that we're going to fully realize those numbers.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about your same-store revenue guidance. You had signed leases at 13% increases in January. You talked about this positive pricing trend of 27% over last year and then 11% loss to lease. And on top of that, your market rental growth, which I'm sure is not really factored into this. But how do you get to the low end of your same-store revenue guidance of 8% just given these other factors?\nBob Garechana: Yes. Hey John, it's Bob. I'll take a stab at this, and I'll piggyback with Michael, if there's anything. I think when you think about the range on the revenue guidance side, and Michael outlined in his script a little bit, most of the growth is coming from rate, right. And there's different flavors that you just outlined in terms of rate. A lot of that rate is kind of, I'll call it, baked in because it's capturing that existing loss to lease, et cetera. The way you get to the low end of the guidance range is that you don't get as much intra-period market rent growth during 2022, right. So if you think about it as we kind of continue on the pricing trend, the low end would imply that we don't get much intra period. The higher end would imply that we get more intra period than what we otherwise anticipated. And the midpoint is slightly above trend, above historical trend intra period growth. And that's how you kind of balance the range. The range is a little wider than what we've historically done because I do think there is a little bit more potential for volatility given what's out there. But those are kind of the low end, the middle and the high.\nJohn Kim: And what do you expect as far as the difference between new and renewal leases? They're basically on top of each other in the fourth quarter. I would have thought that you would have had a higher new lease rates, just given it goes straight to market rather than renewals where you may be more difficult to reduce concessions. How do you think \u2013 how do you think that goes for the rest of the year?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So this is Michael. I think clearly, in the first several months of the year, you're going to see that new lease change starts to outperform the renewal numbers. We got pretty good insight into the renewal performance for the first quarter. You can look at what we're quoting for February and March and see that it's kind of right in line. We've been quoting just around 14%. We're achieving around 12% in these months. I would expect that to continue. But on that new lease side, you're going to see a little bit more momentum kick in here as you go January, February and probably even into March, and then you'll start to see it kind of moderate a little bit. And as you turn the corner and get towards the back half of the year, I think those numbers are going to converge together.\nJohn Kim: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rick Hightower with Evercore.\nRick Hightower: Good morning, guys. So I guess just to dig down a little bit on \u2013 in terms of new and renewals. If we go by market, there are some pretty dramatic differences. I'm looking at San Francisco, but that's not the only example between new lease change and renewal rates in the fourth quarter. But what's interesting, too, is the pattern differs across different markets, right? It's not consistent across the market. So what explains that? Is there something with concessions that's driving that? How do you expect that to trend over the year? I mean, give us maybe a little more detail on some of the market-by-market color there.\nMichael Manelis: Hey, Rick, this is Michael. So I'll just start, I think, maybe, are you focused on the sequential changes that you're seeing across the markets and the differential that you're seeing in the fourth quarter over the third and the momentum?\nRick Hightower: I'm looking at just for the fourth quarter, the differences between new lease growth achieved and renewal lease growth achieved. And again, San Francisco being a good example of, call it, a 900 basis point difference one versus the other. But again, that pattern is not consistent across all markets.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So I think you got to go market by market and you got to understand the retention. You need to understand the regulation limits of the caps that you're bumping up against. And in certain markets like San Francisco or even in New York, you got to understand the concession use that was in play this time last year or in the fourth quarter of 2020 and that comp period is kind of what's driving some of that. So I would be looking more into that January kind of projection and just thinking about where you see those spreads today and know that the renewal number is probably going to stay like I just said, in that similar range, but you're going to get a little bit more momentum out of that new lease change in some of those recovery markets.\nRick Hightower: Okay. Okay. Maybe we can dig into it kind of separately off the call. But that is helpful. And then my second question, just on the 25 basis points of, call it, net investment dilution forecasted this year embedded within guidance? I mean I think you guys did a little bit better than that in 2021, maybe versus original expectations. What are the chances that you can exceed that little bit of dilution in 2022 with your investment activity. What would drive that?\nMark Parrell: Hey Rich, it's Mark. Our goal is not to have any dilution maybe even have accretion, that would be wonderful. But we're trying to do is build a great long-term portfolio, and there are timing issues, too. So I'd just tell you that 25 basis points of dilution is just what's in our model. It's just what's in our guidance. The number could be slightly more or slightly less. Right now, it feels great to be selling these assets in these established markets that are older, they're nice properties, but there are a lot of older assets, they have big capital needs, sometimes regulatory challenges in buying these newer assets in these new markets for us. So that trade even feels like a good deal to us. So I think you'll continue to see us trade even if it's de minimisly dilutive. And again, there are timing issues, too. Sometimes you sell before you buy and things of that nature. So I'll tell you, the goal of Alec and his team is to trade as accretively as possible. But on the other hand, not to be fooled by that initial cap rate and to be thinking hard about the long-term return on the asset.\nRick Hightower: All right, thank Mark. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: Hey good morning, guys, and congrats on a very solid quarter. We run a cash model. And so I wanted to speak a little bit about the same-store revenue guidance on a cash basis. I recognize that you didn't provide that. But I would think that the cash number would be higher than the GAAP number given the rent benefits that you're providing in 1H of 2021. Can you provide what it would be on a cash basis or at least walk us through if our reasoning is correct?\nBob Garechana: Yes, Rich. Let's talk through this a little bit. So let's talk just straight on a cash basis kind of what we're assuming in the 2020 revenue number. So in 2021, right, you had call it, $27 million, which we disclosed on Page 12 of cash concessions. We're assuming at the midpoint of our guidance that we have significantly less concessions in that, right. So this is all cash to cash, right. And so therefore, we're thinking that we're going to normalize something back to normal. It's not quite the 4Q annualized, but it's something in that general ballpark that we're assuming at the midpoint. So what's happening, I think, is the inverse of what you just talked about. So in 2021, the GAAP number was negatively impacted by concessions. In 2022, it will benefit from concessions, right. So the cash number on a year-over-year growth rate basis should be a little bit lower than the midpoint that we had in our guidance range. And based on the numbers that I just outlined to you, it should be, call it, 60 basis points lower at the midpoint than the 9% that we just gave.\nMark Parrell: And Rich, just to add a little bit, it's Mark. The general rule you should think about here is that when you're doing concessions, and we were in a concessionary environment for a while, at the beginning, when you're issuing large amounts of concessions, your concession fully net effective number for revenue will be higher than it would be on a cash basis. We're now at the tail end of that where these concessions are going away, and that means that the opposite is now generally true and that you're doing a little bit better on the other direction. So your GAAP number is generally not doing the same. So that's just so you understand the trade. So when we disclose on Page 12, as Bob said, that for the full year, the difference is 4.6 GAAP versus negative 3.2 cash. You're effectively going to have that thing switch around a little bit. You're not going to have concessions improving your number like you did. You're going to have concessions hurting your numbers slightly. And that's what it does. So I think our cash number is 80 basis points lower.\nBob Garechana: It's about 70 basis points lower than the nine at the midpoint. So you've got more like an 8.3 on a cash basis year-over-year than the nine.\nRich Hill: Got it. That's crystal clear, guys. And I'm really asking the question because it's obviously not uniformity across your peers about how that's reported, which I think is important to understand. I want to come back to the new leases and renewal leases. I appreciate the transparency and the disclosure about why you might not be capturing the whole 20% growth. But I think what I heard from you is next couple of quarters \u2013 next couple of months, you can expect to be a sort of a steady state as to what you showed in January. It will begin to decelerate in the second half of the year. But as we start to look forward to 2023, and I'm not looking forward \u2013 not looking for you to guide here. But what I thought you were telling us was the near-term is never going to be as high as a 20% blended. It's going to be lower, but that probably means you extend some of it out into 2023. And therefore, the blended spread in 2023 can probably be higher than what some people were expecting because it's just pushed out. Is that the right way to think about that?\nMichael Manelis: Yes, absolutely. It defers it and pushes it into the next year.\nMark Parrell: So just to be clear, you will get all of that change. It's just a matter of when. And that depends on, as Michael said, the lease maturity schedule, a little bit of regulatory pressure, those sorts of things. But you'll get the whole thing unless the market changes. It's just whether it's all this year or a little bit falls into 2023.\nRich Hill: Got it. And so said another way, if you're going to put up, let's just say, slightly less than 12.5% blended, we should think about rolling the difference between that 12.5% and that 20% into 2023?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I mean, I think a lot is going to depend on what intra-period growth looks like and the timing of that growth, whether it's early in the year or later. But yes, I mean, I think that's a fair way to model.\nRich Hill: Okay, thank you guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. In terms of San Francisco Bay Area, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about \u2013 you said that good demand but not pricing power, and maybe you could talk about how that's doing in the different submarkets you're in, in the Bay Area?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Hey Nick, this is Michael. So clearly, there's a divergence, right. With the city of San Francisco, is the area that has the most pronounced spread to the pre-pandemic pricing. You actually have pockets as you work your way in through the East Bay that's right on top of it. The peninsula is really approaching kind of that pre-pandemic. And the South Bay, despite the 4,000 units that just came to the market, is also just like that peninsula area, it's right on top of that pre-pandemic pricing. So I think what we're seeing is just when you roll it up at the market level, and we're still that 6% off of the pre-pandemic pricing, it's mostly weighted down from the city of San Francisco. And you have signs of that demand returning in there. You just don't have quite enough of it to get to that pricing power that you need to fully recapture everything. But the signs are there, and the question is just how fast in the year you can get to that price because the earlier we get it, the more it's going to yield the revenue growth this year versus deferring into 2023.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thanks Michael. That's helpful. Going to the bad debt that number that's been just under 2% that on Page 2 of the stuff that is an additive benefit to your same-store revenue growth and it's been the same number over the last two quarters. How should we think about that benefit continuing to play out in 2022 from a timing standpoint, from a quarterly standpoint, are you still getting that for a couple of quarters?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So hey, Nick, it's Bob. Let me talk about the kind of two competing factors that go into that number as we think about how we modeled it in 2022. So one of the competing factors is the rental assistance, right. So rental assistance, which I think we talked about a little bit earlier on the call, we'll reduce that number, and we do expect that to trail into 2022 because the programs are not completely done. And we would expect that to be front half, right. And so that will benefit you on the front half basis. The opposite competing factor is just the actual resident behavior in terms of who's paying, who's not paying and how that kind of progresses. We do expect a benefit for that to occur, but that's probably more back half loaded. So what I think you're going to end up having, depending on how this all plays out is something that's pretty constant, maybe a little sub-2% level that will be kind of throughout the years as you go through the quarter. But those are your two factors that are driving kind of the bad debt. We do think on an absolute basis the bad debt will be lower with both those factors in 2022 relative to 2021.\nMark Parrell: And maybe we'll give a little bit more precision and Bob will help me. It's Mark here because I'm just playing CFO now. I'm not actually doing that job anymore. But our \u2013 in the old days before the pandemic, our bad debt write-offs are generally 40 or 50 basis points of revenues. They obviously went up considerably during the pandemic. And now you're getting these pretty variable numbers because of these \u2013 the great job Michael and the team have been doing with our residents of getting some of this government rental relief money. So the question on the run rate is probably a number that's in the 1.5% range for the year because it's still \u2013 there still are eviction restrictions and where they aren't, there's just slow processes. And there's just still some stuff the system needs to work through, Nick. So our sense is it's higher than a normal year but considerably lower than the 2.7% or so we were feeling through most of 2020. Is that a good enough number, Bob?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So even more specific. So we have, call it, $30-odd million of bad debt net of rental assistance in 2021. A normal year to Mark's point, would have been something more like 10%. We won't get all the way back to the 10%, but we might get close to halfway there in 2022. So we'll add something that's, call it, $15 million to $20 million of bad debt is what we've included in our guidance.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Very helpful, guys. Just one quick follow-up on the renewals. You talked about, you felt pretty good about keeping pricing for renewals this year. I mean should we assume that something over 10% is baked into the guidance for renewal growth this year?\nMichael Manelis: Well, no, I think what you need to remember is that the first part of this year is going to be strong. It's going to be these 12% numbers on the renewal. And then as you turn the corner in the back half of the year, I think you should expect some moderation. So I don't think it's materially below 10%, but I'm not sure we're going to stay at a 12% run throughout the whole year.\nNick Yulico: Okay, thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: Hi, congratulations on a strong quarter. So I'd like to talk about your relationship with Toll Brothers. Builders obviously have been experiencing widespread disruption. They have talked about labor challenges, materials and sort of extending their cycle times. Toll Brothers also in December kind of talked about its own cycle times getting extended. So what are you seeing from your standpoint? And then any change there from a timing perspective, when do you expect to deliver the first set of developments within that relationship?\nAlec Brackenridge: Sure, and this is Alec. So what we're seeing \u2013 and we haven't broken ground on anything in our joint venture with Toll, yes. I don't have any Toll-specific information on something that's under construction. But I can say that for the projects that we're working on with other partners, it's a question of timing, right. So things have pushed out by a matter of months but it's not whether or not the project gets done. And that's true of us and many of our competitors as well. So people are getting around the supply chain challenges, either by finding substitute products or warehousing the inventory that they need. So costing a little more, taking a little more time. But on the other hand, rents have been rising. So I'm not sure yields in most cases, have materially changed. The other thing that we would say is we are in a different business, apartment construction versus single-family home construction. I mean that's more of an assembly line at a moment. You just need 1,000 windows, you need them right now. And for us, we have longer cycle times. It's a lot longer period of time to build an apartment building than a single single-family home. So maybe you don't have the windows, but maybe you have all the dry wall you can do or whatever the situation is. You can kind of manage things a little bit better than I think you probably can if you just can't deliver the house at all because you just don't have a key component. Well in apartments, you can go to a different stage in the process, at least sometimes and knock that out.\nChandni Luthra: Understood. And then I'd like to follow up on your expense outlook. So obviously, if you kind of go back and look at 2019, your expenses were a little over 3.5%. And then 2020 and 2021 were very well controlled and you gave some color on payroll growth in 2021 and sort of how that was a big tailwind. As we think about 2022 with the midpoint of 3%. Besides payroll, what are the other factors that are helping if you think about big categories such as taxes, utilities, repair, et cetera?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So let's start with the biggest category because it is \u2013 we expect it to continue to be a help as it was in 2021, which is real estate taxes. So real estate taxes, we do expect to grow below trend. And a lot of that has to do with timing as well. So some of the real estate jurisdictions are not on calendar years, so they're on different fiscal years. So we've already got like locked and assessed values that are lower or rates that are lower or just the general health of the jurisdiction is better. So we have a little bit of that continuation kind of flowing through. So we'd expect real estate taxes to be more around a 2% kind of growth rate than maybe in 2019 or historical and real estate taxes were more three to four. So that will drive some of the assistance. The payroll, I think you already hit upon. Utilities and R&M will be probably mixed, will probably be a little above average. I think that depends on a variety of factors on how it flows through on utilities with commodity prices and other areas where we've seen a little bit of relief as of late. A lot of the utility price we're able to pass back to the resident. So it's more of a geography than a kind of net-net impact overall. But it's the combo of good expense controls and initiatives associated with payroll, continuing to manage the R&M piece and then also benefiting from real estate taxes.\nChandni Luthra: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, good morning, everyone. On the development front, you have the $450 million and starts in 2021. Can you talk about what that number is expected to be in 2022 and maybe any trajectory over the next few years?\nAlec Brackenridge: This is Alec. Yes, we're working on growing that pipeline. $450 million was a kind of jump-starting our program, which was helpful to that Toll had these three projects ready to go. But we're hoping to grow that to $1 billion or $1.2 billion over time. This year it will probably be somewhere between the $450 million and $1 billion.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then on the transaction front, how do you think broadly the market is likely to respond to these higher rates? Are we going to see eventually cap rates move up with some sort of lag? Or do you think that just the underlying growth expectations have increased enough that things value sort of end up in the same place?\nMark Parrell: Yes. I mean, we're in that latter camp, Brad, it's Mark, about value staying, give or take where they are. I think interest rates going up are pretty manageable for value. So you think about the customary spread, and we talked about this on the last call of between the 10-year treasury and prevailing apartment cap rates of being 200 basis points give or take, and you imagine the Fed moving short rates and long rates responding and you wonder if the cap rates should go up. And I guess \u2013 given how durable multifamily cash flow has proven to be even during what was, I think, the biggest crisis in the industry's history in the last few years. I mean, we were hit pretty hard and we're right back in two years and on a good growth trajectory and the great prospects going forward. I feel like that bit of a risk premium is going to decline a bit. I also think there's a wall of capital that I know you're well familiar with that wants into real estate and specifically into apartments. I heard that number quoted as all sorts of different numbers, but it seems to be at least $100 billion or more. So I think that creates a floor as well. So our sense is that as long as interest rates going up, doesn't crush growth and take the whole economy into a serious recession. Values will remain pretty good. And I also think you're going to get both real and nominal cash flow growth. So I think your NOI that you're applying your cap rate too, is going to improve as well over the next few years.\nBrad Heffern: Great, appreciate the color. Thanks.\nAlec Brackenridge: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning out there. Just going back to the opening comments on the rent increases, and you guys were clear that a lot of this year is going to be driven by the burn off of the free rent from last year. Just based on the rents that you're sending out on a face-to-face sort of apples-to-apples comparison, how much are the new rents going up? So basically, if someone had two months free last year, is it just reflecting that now they're not getting that two months free to whatever they were paying in face last year is what they're paying now. Or are you able to raise that face rate, call it, 5%, 10%, 2%? I'm just trying to get some perspective on the actual rent increase.\nMichael Manelis: Hey Alex, this is Michael. So maybe I'll start with this for a little bit. So there's a couple of ways to look at that. First, you can go into the fourth quarter kind of statistics around like the new lease renewal and the blended and just look at the difference between like a net effective and a gross \u2013 and I'll tell you, you can almost say it's about a 300 basis point impact where outside of concessions that net effective is being kind of lifted up by about a 300 basis point impact from the use of concessions in that prior period. But a better way to kind of think about this is if you look at the loss to lease that we have today in January, and I'd say we are approaching right at around 11%. That's on a net effective basis. And when you look at that on a gross basis, so without any regard to any concession activity either last year or this year, it's about a 75 basis point impact. So you have about a 10.25% loss to lease right now on just rate. And that's the opportunity that allows you to work your way through 2022 and capture that rate, and some of that will fold into 2023.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So then if the bulk of the mark-to-market is really rate, not necessarily concessions, you're saying your inability to capture that is really just purely from markets where you're restricted on your ability to push rents?\nMark Parrell: And timing, right, not all leases expire, Alex, on January 1. That's the other. So you got to \u2013 so it's a little \u2013 it's Mark, it's a little bit of both. I mean certainly, there's some regulatory restrictions, particularly in Southern California, but there's also just timing. We don't \u2013 our leases don't overrule January 1. So what we do is that we get that money the next year. So that is going to contribute to 2023. And just to talk about the concession. I mean we did take all that pain through the system. Our shareholders felt that. So the fact that there is some concession makeup. I mean that is real cash flow we didn't get that we will get. So it isn't \u2013 I don't think you're implying this, but it isn't an accounting charge. It is a true cash flow reduction we had that we're now getting back.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes. Look, look, no landlord wants to not get paid for rent. Totally agree with you, Mark. The second question is on the assets that you're selling. Obviously, great cap rates on the sale. But if you think about your basis on those assets, what's the current yield that you're giving up? So great that you're selling whatever 3.7, awesome. But if you think about the cash yield that you're giving up, is that like a 6? Is that 5? Is that a 7? Because some of these things you've owned a long time with your basis being a lot lower, correct?\nMark Parrell: Well, I'm going to \u2013 it's Mark. Just to ask a question. The 3.7 we quote you, the disposition yield is what we think forward cash flow is based on the price we sold it at. So it is what EQR would have gotten if we had kept these assets. So if you're talking about what our historic book value is, just to give you a sense of perspective because we just had this conversation with our Chief Accounting Officer, I mean, this company is very good at investing in apartments, so we have half the book basis or so of, I guess, compared to the actual sale price and most of that, the vast majority of that is in depreciation. It's actual gain on sale. So I don't know if that's helpful perspective to you, but the book value, it's fair to say is about half. But I'm not sure why the book value is terribly relevant. And the 3.7 is a good reflection of the cash flow EQR gave up. Is that helpful?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes, yes. That's \u2013 because obviously, you had an investment before, Mark, that was yielding you. It sounds like double the 3.7% that you're selling it. So I'm just trying to get that perspective as you're reinvesting the capital.\nMark Parrell: Yes. I don't know about double because, again, you're failing to mark the asset to market. If you \u2013 I mean, we don't operate on a historic basis here. You don't look at an asset and say, it's only worth its net book value. It can be worth more or less. And in our case, it's often worth more. So I'm a little confused by the comparison of net book value using that as your denominator with cash flow as your numerator. I think cash flow forward is your numerator and your denominator is what you sold the asset for you think the asset is worth at the moment, right.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes, yes. You answered my question, so we're all set. Anyway, listen, thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nMarty McKenna: Operator, do we have another question?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays.\nAnthony Powell: Hey, good morning. Question about renewals. You said that your renewal rates were among the highest they've ever been. I'm just curious, what do you think causes that to normalize? And does it matter to you? Do you prefer more renewals or less in the current environment?\nMichael Manelis: So this is Michael. I mean, clearly, we want retention, right. We deliver an outstanding customer service to our residents. We have a market price that we're using as a quote and we want our residents to stay with us. So as I think about that retention right now, you do have a couple of areas that the retention is super high, and that is probably being influenced by some of the regulations that's keeping some of those increases, call it, well below what the current market rate is, again. And that, to us, is just a deferral of the revenue into next year. But I think what you should expect to see is as the year goes on, I'm guessing we could see a little bit of that moderation on that retention or on that percent of residents renewing. But I don't think it's going to be material. I mean our residents are telling us, and you could see by the increases that we've been putting out there and they're signing with us that it's not an affordability issue. You may see a little bit of a tick up based on increase and then moving around. But I think we expect to see strong retention through the year.\nAnthony Powell: Got it, thanks. And one more for me on the cap rates on acquisition and disposition. I asked a few times on the call already. But do you expect to see some expansion in some of your sales activity and maybe some contraction than what you're buying? Or is it given what you talked about in terms of the capital coming into the space, do you expect to see continued low cap rates for even some of those for you target noncore sales that you're selling now?\nAlec Brackenridge: We're seeing flow cap rates kind of across the board. We're also a very tactical seller, right. So if a market has not got a lot of bids in a particular \u2013 last year, we didn't feel like New York \u2013 there was a lot of interest in New York. So we didn't sell. Now we're feeling differently. We have a property under contract, and we'll get a low cap rate on that. And but investor interest is broad across the markets, and we're going to continue to match sources and uses here with the dispositions paying for the acquisitions, as Mark said, at roughly the same cap rates.\nAnthony Powell: Right, thank you.\nAlec Brackenridge: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney.\nRob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Bob, what did you guys spend on new and recurring technology in 2021 that allowed you to have the AI and the self-guided tours and the negative on-site payroll growth? And what are you expecting to spend in 2022?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So in fairness, and I'll let Michael chime in here. Most of the investments that yielded the results in 2021 related to the AI and other things were actually spent in prior years. There's a little bit of chicken and egg thing. So typically, what you see is investment in the overhead or technology like the AI, which by the way, was relatively inexpensive, I think, sub $1 million. You see that investment happen first as the enabler, and then you begin to see the reduction in the on-site kind of payroll or the change in the staffing. And so then when you move forward to 2022, we're in that position where we're once again in a phase of investment in the technology, and that's a lot of what our above-trend overhead growth that I alluded to in my comments is driven on. It's a lot of tech, it's some centralization of staffing, et cetera. So there's, call it, maybe $4 million or $5 million at least embedded in kind of the prop management growth rate. You're seeing some of that come out again in the 2022 numbers. But a lot of it is the investment into 2023 and 2024, and you've seen in some of our presentation decks, what we think the growth potential of that. When we make these investments that are going between geographies, just so you know, it's a very ROI-focused. Geographies don't matter, bottom line and cash flow do. And so what we look to do is to invest in technology or invest in centralization that gets a positive ROI overall regardless of geography.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. Mark, anything incremental from a legislative, regulatory, ballot initiative perspective that you're worried about at this point that could have a significant impact, if enacted?\nMark Parrell: Well, we're probably feeling a little better in a couple of places. I certainly think in New York, the new mayor seems to have been elected by a populist that wants practical problem solving government in New York and is thinking about the crime issue in a good, thoughtful way. So that's \u2013 we think that's positive. The governor has a lot of experience with real estate and understands how market factors work in real estate. So that \u2013 so probably feel smidge better in New York. I would say 1 thing in California, there will be an expiration shortly of a prohibition on local eviction moratoriums. And we do have some concern about that. I mean that is something we do think about. We think the time has passed for those sorts of emergency measures justified by COVID and that the system needs to adjust itself. And if there's going to be a need to keep people in homes of that sort, then the government should fund those kind of programs with enhanced vouchers or whatnot. But that's probably the thing that's foremost in our minds. And like I said, I think I feel a little better about New York, maybe not a lot, but a little in terms of the policymaking and then we'll continue to keep our eye on good cause eviction as well. And in some of our other markets, again, there seems to be more focus on quality of life and concerns of that sort, whether it's in Seattle or the city of San Francisco, and we welcome that as well.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then one last one for me, Bob. What was the $17 million impairment charge in the quarter related to?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So that related to a specific parcel of land and you can notice looking at our balance sheet, we don't have much land at all. But it related to a specific parcel of land in downtown Los Angeles that we no longer anticipate pursuing from a development standpoint. We obviously do a very thorough review of our land bank and all our assets from an impairment standpoint periodically and that change in intent is largely what drove that charge.\nRob Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys.\nBob Garechana: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, there. Thank you. I just wanted to go back. I don't know if you \u2013 did you outline a time line for getting your portfolio to that kind of pro forma balance that you mentioned early in the call that one-third California, one-third the balance you outlined earlier. And then also, it looks like there's a bit more wood to chop in California. So maybe as part of that, can you talk about the level of demand and buy a profile that you're seeing in California. We keep hearing a lot of chatter that end is far less for close to California. I'm just curious on what you're seeing there? Thanks.\nMark Parrell: Haendel, it's Mark. I'm going to start with the timing, and I'm going to leave Alec to talk about what's going on in the California sales side. So it will take a few more years. I mean, $2 billion is our goal on buys and sells. There was a lot of products sold towards the end of 2021. And so 2022 is not yet that busy, that's pretty common for the first quarter to be a little quieter. We'd love to do more than $2 billion, but we'll do only as much as makes sense on both the buy and the sell side. So I think you should expect this to take several more years to fully effectuate. But I'd say, in the meantime, the holders are going to get the benefit of the strong recovery in our established markets. And so again, we're going to continue to own a lot in New York, and New York is going to be a terrific market in 2022. And then you'll see our exposure to that market drop over time. And I think, hopefully, that will be well timed with improvements in performance in some of the Sunbelt markets that we're adding exposure. And so I think it is going to be a couple more years for sure until we get to that balance I've spoken of.\nAlec Brackenridge: And as to investor \u2013 and this is Alec. As investor interest in California, we see both newer transactions that we're typically looking at buying, and it's been a very full bidding tent for that. And also the older stuff that we're selling into such a slightly different buyer in many cases, more value-add focused. Also a lot of interest. The exception to that is really downtown San Francisco. There has not been a significant trade. And right now, I think the market has to continue to recover both from a rent level, which it's starting to do but also from investor appetite. It's somewhat analogous to New York, where 12 months ago, we felt the same way we needed to wait on that before we sold any property there. And San Francisco is a little lagging behind that, but that is the market where you just don't see much sales transaction. Otherwise, it's very robust.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Appreciate that. Mark, assuming you're open to fast-tracking that, should a portfolio present itself and you have identified use of proceeds? Or is this something you just want to manage a bit more rationally here over the next couple of years?\nMark Parrell: I apologize. I didn't \u2013 that broke up a little. Would you repeat that question?\nHaendel St. Juste: I was asking you. Would you \u2013 theoretically, are you open to fast tracking that, the asset recycling out of California should there be maybe a portfolio...\nMark Parrell: Absolutely. If there was an opportunity of that sort, we'd be all over it. But a lot of the portfolios we've seen that have traded or been offered for trade have all sorts of frailties. They're either a lot older product or they're in the wrong place or both. And they may have a few of the assets we want, but we're looking to try and make trades that move that goal along. Listen, we're open to buying assets, frankly, anywhere that makes sense if we get a great price. And this is not a market where you're getting a great price. So otherwise, you need to have it make sense relative to the strategy. So we'd love a portfolio acquisition. Alec and his team are super focused on that. We've not seen a lot of those opportunities that were in our wheelhouse come by.\nHaendel St. Juste: Great. One more question. A bit of a question, but just curious on your thoughts. I was intrigued by your reference to the Gen Z cohort earlier. Looking at the numbers, $65 million there large group but noticeably short of the $72 million of the millennial cohort that preceded it. So I guess just thinking ahead, I'm wondering at some point how this kind of plays itself out maybe in less demand or potentially less rate growth at some point. But also I'm curious kind of what have you learned about that cohort, maybe how they differ perhaps from millennials, and this is impacting anything on kind of like collection or services. And then as a follow-up, would you be enticed perhaps to do a bit more in the single-family rentership side as they appear to be more set up to be a beneficiary of the millennial, the aging of the millennials? Thanks.\nMark Parrell: Well, there's a lot in there, and I don't know if some of the rest of the team might contribute to the answer. I mean I have two Gen Zers sitting in my house that I very much want to get out there launched. And we see that cohort as very large. And I think with \u2013 we hope sensible immigration policies. I'm not sure it will end up being much smaller or smaller at all than the millennial generation was. So besides the raw numbers, there's also what percent of those people are captured in the apartment rentership world versus home ownership or single-family rentership. And I think we're going to capture and continue to capture a fair amount of these millennials. I mean it's been well documented that a lot of those folks have pretty good P&Ls, pretty good earnings power. But not necessarily a lot of savings to put down the purchase homes. And so a lot of those folks are going to stay longer with us, and they value that flexibility from rentership. So our sense, and again, we've seen research on this is that even though the ownership percentages have been going up and millennials are certainly part of that, I think we're going to continue to have a pretty good share of that millennial population even as it ages. Our average renter is 33 years old in our portfolio. So it's a little older than some of our competitors. So I think we are still approaching the high watermark for the millennial generation in terms of the largest single year of population. So that all feels good. I think the runway for demographics and apartments is really good. In terms of going into the single-family business, we're a residential company. We think about all those things all the time. But what we have in front of us is this really good opportunity to build 12-or-so market portfolio in the best places for affluent renters to live in the U.S. We're really good at managing apartments, and we're good at that. We can be good at other things, too. But I think what we have in front of us is an opportunity to really trade out of some of the older product and maybe regulatory challenged product and move into apartments. That seems like that's right in front of us. I wonder if that isn't the opportunity for us right now as opposed to trying some new things, especially since those new things aren't cheap. So I think single-family is certainly analogous property type and plenty of our ex employees have worked there in pretty senior roles. So we know a fair bit about it. And we think about it a fair bit. But it isn't something that, from my perspective, is the immediate opportunity.\nHaendel St. Juste: Great. Well, listen, thank you for the time. Appreciate the thoughts.\nMark Parrell: Thanks Haendel.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. Mark, if we can just stay on this idea of the refined portfolio like it's about, let's call it, $6 billion or $7 billion of assets out of New York and California to rotate into that diagonal line starting up in Seattle. And I recognize $2 billion a year will take you through the three years. You've been selling a lot of assets outright. Have you given any thought or is there an opportunity to maybe do a fund or a larger joint venture because I would assume that there's a fair amount of capital out there that would like equity residential as an operator and just given your presence in these markets, owning 25% of an asset continuing to manage it is better? Or is your mindset, no, I just want to be out completely and not have a stub interest in the market?\nMark Parrell: We're open to joint ventures. There are some places where we're probably more open to them. For example, the city of San Francisco with very high transfer taxes, maybe a place we're selling part is better. Selling twice as much in halves is better than selling one whole. So I guess, Michael, we are open to it. That's a different pocket of money. We have conversations. We know all those people. If an asset just needs to be sold, we want to sell it. We don't want to put a partner into an asset that we think will be challenged, but there are certainly assets we're just overexposed in the submarket and we just like to have a little less exposure. So we're open to that, and we've had those kind of conversations. But honestly, the market to sell 100% has been so darn good. We've just gone ahead and done that. But we're open to that. And the most important part of that is we found more to buy, then we'd like hit the switch on everything, JVs and larger portfolio dispositions and all of that. So the big limiter on doing one of those trades is all of a sudden, Alec, would get $600 million of cash that he need to reinvest in 90 days in a bunch of new great apartments. And that Michael, probably, concerns me most is how we would go about finding that new product, more than anything else.\nMichael Bilerman: I mean how do you think about, I guess, rather than selling assets, just growing the base? I know it takes longer to do. But there's an element that maybe just \u2013 you talked about your rents being back at peak levels, your stock is too, right? So your equity all of a sudden becomes attractive potentially. I don't know how you think about it to issue to grow rather than selling cash flow assets.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Well, I mean, we do intend to grow. The development engine, we hope, will create some growth. We're open to the suggestion you made. It's again finding things to buy. If there was a lot to buy out there, Michael, and we might be very interested in using debt. We have a lot of debt capacity, maybe a little bit of equity and start buying, we'd love to get bigger. That's \u2013 we think this is a great time to be in the apartment business and would love to have both asset and cash flow growth. We'll get a lot of cash flow growth from just the existing business. So I'd tell you on both of your very good questions. The limiter is more our opportunity set not us wanting to pull those levers. We'll pull the JV lever, we'll pull the equity lever, if there was a lot of great things to buy. With it being such a tough market to acquire in, the trading activity has been probably a better way for us to go.\nMichael Bilerman: Right. And just as I think back to EQR history, as they've gone \u2013 as your company has gone through, different times of market repositioning going back to the 2000s and then obviously, the Starwood deal pre-pandemic, that put the company into six core markets. I guess are you thinking at all about a larger transaction, and I know it has to be available for you. But at least relative to some other times, you have culminated the market repositioning with a large \u2013 a much larger transaction versus this sort of just year-by-year methodology?\nMark Parrell: And we'll react to the opportunity set that presents itself. I mean I appreciate the comment because you're right, we are transactionalists. We're good at doing large deals. We know how to integrate assets 50 at a time or more into the portfolio. But again, I don't see that opportunity set out there. So I guess it's hard to react in the abstract to that. But I'd rather be done with this process. That part, I agree with you. EQR would rather be done with the realignment process, but we're not in such a hurry that we'll do it by buying lower quality assets.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay, great. See you in Florida.\nMark Parrell: See you there.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey, guys. I just wanted to ask about a follow-up to an earlier comment where you spoke about same-store guidance ranges and you mentioned trend intra-period rate growth. Can you just remind me what the \u2013 kind of how to think about trend intra-period rate growth is and the seasonality?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So if you think about kind of \u2013 and I'll use maybe 2018, 2019 is like typical, right. So typical for this business kind of trend would have been something in the high 2s, low 3s in terms of rent growth and it tends to start \u2013 you start a little bit in the first quarter. You build in the second quarter at the beginning of the lease season. You peak in the third quarter and then you typically have a little bit of a sequential rent decline as you get to the fourth quarter. So that would be a typical kind of pricing trend as you looked in other years, right. Now from a revenue standpoint, you're obviously not going to capture all of that because we talked about you don't write all your leases on 1:1. You have \u2013 you maybe capture half of it based on the outlook, what I outlined in terms of actual revenue performance in a given year. So that's kind of what I think about in terms of trend. What we've assumed in our 2022 guidance is that we follow that kind of same shape of the curve but that is a little bit above trend, right, that we continue to see that strength and it is a little bit higher than trend. If that is much above trend, right, is something that is approaching more like the mid-single digits or even above, that's going to push your guidance range \u2013 your guidance results to the \u2013 or your actual results to the high end of the guidance range. If you're below that, call it, three that I was saying trend and you get kind of no growth, that will push you down towards the bottom end of the range.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then that 25 basis points drag from capital recycling, is that just a function of timing or maybe a difference in cap rates across what you're buying and selling?\nMark Parrell: Yes, it's Mark. It's kind of just in our model. It can be either one. But like this year, we didn't have any. And our goal with Alec is to not have any again or for it to be accretive. But it can be from either. It can be from selling early in the year and thus having more disposition NOI gone or it could be from buying early in the year and having more accretion just by virtue of that. So either or, I guess, I'd tell you. You just take 25 basis points, multiply it by $2 billion that's the negative drag somewhere in EQR's P&L model on this activity.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Awesome. It sounds like a potential source of upside, last year you had none. So if I'm reading it correctly. Thanks guys.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Mark Parrell for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark Parrell: Well, thank you all for your time today. We look forward to seeing many of you in person at the conferences that are coming up and in your offices over the next few months. Thank you very much. Stay well.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. This morning, I will provide highlights on how we finish the year and give you some color on 2022 revenue guidance and market performance. So first, a big thank you to our teams across the country who have worked so hard during these trying times to deliver these results and are all geared up to make 2022 a terrific year for Equity Residential. The recovery continues despite the presence of the Omicron variant and noise from uncertainty in back-to-the-office plans with tremendous demand to live at our properties, both urban and suburban. We see reopened restaurants, entertainment venues and other lifestyle amenities as attracting our affluent resident base without regard to continuing low office occupancy rates. Absent a government-mandated closure of businesses in cities, which we see is unlikely, the lifestyle that our residents crave is again available in most of our markets and our residents are voting with their feet and pocket books to be in these locations whether they anticipate working fully remote, hybrid or fully in the office. Interestingly, we see a little less of this trend in our tech heavy Seattle and San Francisco markets, which I will discuss in a moment. We are currently 96.5% occupied and are on track to deliver about 13.5% achieved new lease growth in January after posting just over 10.5% in the fourth quarter. We reported the lowest turnover in our history for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021 which reaffirms the desirability of our product as our resident signed renewals at record levels with increases that average nearly 11% in the quarter. In addition, our residents received $32 million in rent relief with $15 million of that received in the fourth quarter. This performance has positioned us well for 2022 and what we believe will be the best same-store revenue growth in our history. The majority of our 9% same-store revenue growth at the midpoint is coming from resetting existing leases at current market rates. As of January 1, 83% of our residents were paying on average rents that are about 11% below our current market prices. As we have discussed in the past, we won't be able to capture all of this loss to lease in 2022 because leases will reset over the course of the year either through new move-ins or renewals, and there are currently a few regulations that cap our allowable increases. In addition to capturing this reset, we are anticipating intra-year growth in rates that is more reflective of typical seasonal growth than the steep growth we experienced during the 2021 pandemic recovery year. Strong, continued physical occupancy, particularly relative to the comparably weaker period in early 2021 is also a contributor with the remaining growth projected to come from lower bad debt, improved nonresidential revenues and other income. So far, we continue to see strong retention with the percent of residents renewing expected to be just over 60% in both January and February. We may see some moderation from this high level as the year goes on. But interestingly, in Q4, we did not see much disparity in renewal percent for deal seekers, those residents who had a concession on their current lease versus non-deal seekers, meaning many of our residents are deciding to stay put regardless of the rent increase. While the world remains an uncertain place, we feel good about this expected pricing power, given our net effective pricing trend is currently 27% over 2021 levels and 7% over the same pre-pandemic week in 2020. A key driver of this improvement is the sizable reduction in concession use in our portfolio, which is nearly nonexistent with the exception of Seattle, that I will get to in a moment as I provide color on the markets and how they are expected to contribute to 2022. Beginning with Boston, which is following a normal seasonal pattern with improving demand and pricing heading towards the spring, overall, we're 96% occupied today with a drag from the urban core at 95.5 versus the remainder of the market, which is above 96%. With strong continued demand from lab and life sciences, financial firms, health care and education and very little competition from new supply, we expect this market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022. Another positive note is that we continue to see a return of international students and workers to the market. After a difficult period early in the pandemic, the quick turnaround of the New York market has been really amazing. We expect New York to be our best-performing market in 2022 with same-store revenue growth of approximately 13% despite some expected pressure from new supply on the Jersey waterfront in Brooklyn. Demand is very strong, and we have been renewing about 65% of our residents. Occupancy remains above 97%, rates continue to improve, concessions are not being used and pricing is currently 11% over pre-pandemic pricing levels. We expect that Washington, D.C. will be a solid performer in 2022, but will end up as one of our lower producing revenue growth markets at about 4%. This market held up the best of our East Coast markets during the pandemic, and so does not have the same ground to make up. This market also continues to deliver 12,000 or so new units each year, absorption of Class A multifamily has been really strong even during the pandemic, making us optimistic that this absorption trend will continue. Occupancy is steady at 97% and rental rates are following a slightly better-than-expected normal seasonal pattern here. Moving to the West Coast. Both of our tech heavy markets, Seattle and San Francisco, have been slower to recover than other markets. While there is certainly demand, the downtown submarkets are 93% and 96% occupied, respectively. The ambiguity and return to office by big tech employers and quality-of-life challenges are deferring a fuller recovery. We expect that the quality of life issues will improve through a combination of civic engagement and having more activated streetscapes. The tech companies have a role to play here as they balance their growth plans versus employee preferences or work from home in a highly competitive job market. It appears likely that the balance will be met by a hybrid work model which should benefit our business in these markets. But until there is more certainty, some employees will be hesitant to make housing decisions. Longer term, the overall drivers of demand remain positive and we would expect the urban centers of these markets to fully recover because they remain attractive to the many affluent renters that want to enjoy in urban lifestyle there. Also, the tech giants continue to accumulate large amounts of office space, whether through leases or whole building purchases, which indicates that their long-term plans involve some level of in office. We're optimistic about Seattle's recovery and expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022. Our expectations are predicated on the CBD, where we have a large concentration of assets recovering in the back half of the year. Demand is improving. Initial lead and tour volume has ramped up past 2021 levels but our on-site teams are reporting a lack of sense of urgency from potential renters to sign leases right now. Occupancy has rebounded slightly to just over 94.5%. This market is the primary user of concessions in our portfolio with currently about a third of our applications receiving on average just over one month free. Heading down to San Francisco, we are seeing good demand but do not yet have a lot of pricing power. We expect to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 7% in 2022. San Francisco continues to be the only market in our portfolio that has not gotten back to pre-pandemic pricing levels as we are currently 6% below the same week in 2020. Occupancy is holding steady at 96.5%, and we are renewing just under 60% of our residents. Los Angeles continues to be a solid performer with demand driven by a robust return of the online content industry. Occupancy is running at 97%, pricing power is strong. We expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 9% for the year. The percent of residents renewing is the highest we have seen likely due to the impact of local regulations. We expect to continue to renew 65% to 70% of our residents here. Both Orange County and San Diego continue to show remarkable performance with high occupancy and strong retention, supporting very good new lease rents. We expect these markets to produce same-store revenue growth of 10% or greater in the year. In Denver, we have very good demand and expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 9% in 2022. Occupancy is strong at 97%, and we're renewing about 50% of our residents. Lastly, a few thoughts on our additional expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Austin. So far, our newly acquired assets are performing well. Demand remains robust and occupancy levels are high. The expansion markets have seen good growth throughout the pandemic, and we expect that growth to continue in 2022. This is an exciting time for the industry and the overall operations of our company. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana. Well, I think it's a little bit of both of those factors. So one, as that pricing trend improves, it's a lead indicator as to what to expect on that new lease change and renewal in those forward months. But I think clearly, you're subject to who's moving out and who's moving in, a little bit of the timing of when those original leases were written. And then clearly, we are subject to some of these regulations right now that are limiting our ability, mostly on the renewal side of the business with allowable increases which, in my mind, just defers kind of the rent growth that we were going to see in 2022 and pushes it more into 2023 because we're going to recapture that spread again either through that next renewal or at move out and time of a new lease coming in. So I think you're seeing, too, the trend, if you look at that January kind of trend. You're going to continue to see that growth in these first couple of months of this year with both new lease change and the blended. And then you'll start to see us come up against that comp in the back half of the year, and it will start to moderate a little bit. So I think you're seeing us close that gap with that net effective pricing trend, but I don't think you should ever expect that we're going to fully realize those numbers. Yes. So this is Michael. I think clearly, in the first several months of the year, you're going to see that new lease change starts to outperform the renewal numbers. We got pretty good insight into the renewal performance for the first quarter. You can look at what we're quoting for February and March and see that it's kind of right in line. We've been quoting just around 14%. We're achieving around 12% in these months. I would expect that to continue. But on that new lease side, you're going to see a little bit more momentum kick in here as you go January, February and probably even into March, and then you'll start to see it kind of moderate a little bit. And as you turn the corner and get towards the back half of the year, I think those numbers are going to converge together. Hey, Rick, this is Michael. So I'll just start, I think, maybe, are you focused on the sequential changes that you're seeing across the markets and the differential that you're seeing in the fourth quarter over the third and the momentum? Yes. So I think you got to go market by market and you got to understand the retention. You need to understand the regulation limits of the caps that you're bumping up against. And in certain markets like San Francisco or even in New York, you got to understand the concession use that was in play this time last year or in the fourth quarter of 2020 and that comp period is kind of what's driving some of that. So I would be looking more into that January kind of projection and just thinking about where you see those spreads today and know that the renewal number is probably going to stay like I just said, in that similar range, but you're going to get a little bit more momentum out of that new lease change in some of those recovery markets. Yes, absolutely. It defers it and pushes it into the next year. Yes. I mean, I think a lot is going to depend on what intra-period growth looks like and the timing of that growth, whether it's early in the year or later. But yes, I mean, I think that's a fair way to model. Yes. Hey Nick, this is Michael. So clearly, there's a divergence, right. With the city of San Francisco, is the area that has the most pronounced spread to the pre-pandemic pricing. You actually have pockets as you work your way in through the East Bay that's right on top of it. The peninsula is really approaching kind of that pre-pandemic. And the South Bay, despite the 4,000 units that just came to the market, is also just like that peninsula area, it's right on top of that pre-pandemic pricing. So I think what we're seeing is just when you roll it up at the market level, and we're still that 6% off of the pre-pandemic pricing, it's mostly weighted down from the city of San Francisco. And you have signs of that demand returning in there. You just don't have quite enough of it to get to that pricing power that you need to fully recapture everything. But the signs are there, and the question is just how fast in the year you can get to that price because the earlier we get it, the more it's going to yield the revenue growth this year versus deferring into 2023. Well, no, I think what you need to remember is that the first part of this year is going to be strong. It's going to be these 12% numbers on the renewal. And then as you turn the corner in the back half of the year, I think you should expect some moderation. So I don't think it's materially below 10%, but I'm not sure we're going to stay at a 12% run throughout the whole year. Hey Alex, this is Michael. So maybe I'll start with this for a little bit. So there's a couple of ways to look at that. First, you can go into the fourth quarter kind of statistics around like the new lease renewal and the blended and just look at the difference between like a net effective and a gross \u2013 and I'll tell you, you can almost say it's about a 300 basis point impact where outside of concessions that net effective is being kind of lifted up by about a 300 basis point impact from the use of concessions in that prior period. But a better way to kind of think about this is if you look at the loss to lease that we have today in January, and I'd say we are approaching right at around 11%. That's on a net effective basis. And when you look at that on a gross basis, so without any regard to any concession activity either last year or this year, it's about a 75 basis point impact. So you have about a 10.25% loss to lease right now on just rate. And that's the opportunity that allows you to work your way through 2022 and capture that rate, and some of that will fold into 2023. So this is Michael. I mean, clearly, we want retention, right. We deliver an outstanding customer service to our residents. We have a market price that we're using as a quote and we want our residents to stay with us. So as I think about that retention right now, you do have a couple of areas that the retention is super high, and that is probably being influenced by some of the regulations that's keeping some of those increases, call it, well below what the current market rate is, again. And that, to us, is just a deferral of the revenue into next year. But I think what you should expect to see is as the year goes on, I'm guessing we could see a little bit of that moderation on that retention or on that percent of residents renewing. But I don't think it's going to be material. I mean our residents are telling us, and you could see by the increases that we've been putting out there and they're signing with us that it's not an affordability issue. You may see a little bit of a tick up based on increase and then moving around. But I think we expect to see strong retention through the year."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thanks Marty. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. This morning, I'll make some remarks about what we see driving our operating results and cash flow growth this year and going forward. And I will comment on our capital allocation program and what the company will look like when it's complete. After that, Michael Manelis will review our operating performance and outlook for 2022 same-store revenue. Bob Garechana will spend a few moments discussing our innovation activities and their impact on our business. And then we'll go ahead and take your questions. We're very excited about the prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. Our affluent resident base is well employed and receiving healthy raises and they are renewing with us at record levels. The robust demand for Apartment Living in both urban and suburban locations is driving high occupancy and the lowest resident turnover in our history. Our same-store revenue guidance calls for 9% growth at the midpoint, while our normalized funds from operations should grow at about 15%. Both of which would be the best performance in our history. Cash flow from our business is likewise poised to grow strongly. We see this at the beginning of what should be a good run of performance as we welcome the 67 million member strong Generation Z to the rentership world, and as we continue to attract and retain millennials, with our flexible product offerings and a price point that is increasingly affordable relative to surging single-family housing costs. That said, we are aware of the recent storm clouds on the horizon in the general economy, which include high inflation and related concerns about how the Federal Reserve will manage short-term rates in its balance sheet as well as continuing supply chain disruptions and unfortunately, the latest COVID variant. While we are not immune to these pressures, a considerable amount of our expected 2022 revenue growth is already baked into our results in the form of leases recently signed at higher rates as well as an expectation that even if rental rates do not rise in 2022, resetting leases to current market levels will provide a significant revenue boost. In 2023 and beyond, our ability to reset lease rates annually should create a natural hedge in a more inflationary world. We also continue to successfully execute on our expense control management with 3% growth in 2021 and a midpoint expectation of 3% growth in 2022 despite the impact of inflation on many costs in the economy. We run an incredibly efficient platform and continue to harness technology to control expenses, enhance the customer experience and grow our operating margin. Bob will comment on all of this in a moment. Switching over to investments. We had a very active year on that side of the business, with $1.7 billion each in acquisitions and dispositions as well as progress in ramping up our development activities. We continue to optimize our portfolio by successfully recycling out of older assets and deploying capital into newer assets in our expansion markets and the suburbs of our established markets. Our 17 acquired properties have an average age of two years as compared to our 14 disposition assets with an average age of 30 years, and we're recycling all this capital while not diluting earnings. Our 2021 transaction activity on both the buy and sell-side was done at an average cap rate of approximately 3.8%. In 2022, we expect to both sell and buy approximately $2 billion in assets. Our acquisition activity is focused on building out our portfolios in Atlanta, Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver and Austin as well as adding select assets in the suburbs of our existing markets. We continue to see great opportunities in our markets and expect to deploy $2 billion into them in 2022. On the development front, we commenced construction on approximately $450 million in development projects during 2021 and expect to deliver high-quality properties in Denver, suburban New York and Central Washington, D.C. in several years. We also completed the construction of our $400 million Alcott Tower in Central Boston during the quarter, and we're pleased to report that the lease-up is going very well. In terms of the development pipeline. In the quarter, we entered into four separate development joint ventures, in Texas and in Colorado with the Colorado joint venture beginning construction in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the other three expected to do so in 2022. These three parcels are the first in our development program with Toll Brothers. As we have discussed with you before, we are reshaping our portfolio to reflect the demand trend we see of some affluent renters spreading out from the coast and congregating in markets like Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and Denver. We also see a similar but more local dispersion trend in our coastal markets as another group of higher income renters move to the suburbs of our established markets like Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle; and Burlington, Massachusetts near Boston. Now we've always had a presence in the suburban submarkets of our established markets. So what I'm talking about here is just creating a little more balance between urban and suburban markets. We will also continue to have a substantial investment in the urban centers of our markets, and those will continue to attract, we think, high-quality renters seeking to enjoy the many amenities of urban living. Driven by our analytical research and informed by our long experience in the apartment business, we seek to build and buying newer assets in urban and suburban locations in these markets where we see demand from higher renters as being high and likely to grow where single-family housing is expensive relative to renting and where supply is manageable. We expect our refined portfolio to have about one-third of its assets in the three Northeastern markets of Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., with a reduction in exposure coming from New York and Washington, D.C. dispositions. We see approximately one-third or maybe a bit more of the portfolio being in California with divestments there occurring in challenging regulatory locations and of older assets. The remaining third or so of the company will be concentrated in a diagonal from Seattle through Denver, to Austin and Dallas, Texas and over to Atlanta, Georgia. We think this distinct portfolio of newer, less capital-intensive assets in the 12-or-so most desirable metros for more affluent renters to live will provide high and stable long-term returns. We also see reduced regulatory risk and resiliency benefits from this portfolio shift. And finally, before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to give a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You are doing an exceptional job during very unusual times, and we're all very proud and grateful. We're in position for a great 2022, and I look forward to delighting our customers and our investors with you. Go ahead, Michael. Hey John, it's Mark. Just to add to that. And the risks are different in each of these markets. So you get into the intermediate term with some of the markets that we call our established coastal markets. And there is a bit more risk of rent control and things like that interrupting rent growth in those markets. I'd also just say that when you look at the growth in some of these markets, we think of the new portfolio is having a bit of a handoff and this diversification is going to serve us well. We do have supercharged growth this year because of the recovery in our established markets. And as we establish the Sunbelt presence, we're going to have more balance. And I think you're going to see just more balanced growth. So maybe there is a little more growth in the Sunbelt and a little less in established, but we'll pick that up and vice versa. So from our perspective, it's sort of a risk-adjusted thought process and a diversification thought process. So maybe the established markets drive the machine for the next 18 months or two years and maybe some of these diversification markets help add power to the engine in outer years. Hey Rich, it's Mark. Our goal is not to have any dilution maybe even have accretion, that would be wonderful. But we're trying to do is build a great long-term portfolio, and there are timing issues, too. So I'd just tell you that 25 basis points of dilution is just what's in our model. It's just what's in our guidance. The number could be slightly more or slightly less. Right now, it feels great to be selling these assets in these established markets that are older, they're nice properties, but there are a lot of older assets, they have big capital needs, sometimes regulatory challenges in buying these newer assets in these new markets for us. So that trade even feels like a good deal to us. So I think you'll continue to see us trade even if it's de minimisly dilutive. And again, there are timing issues, too. Sometimes you sell before you buy and things of that nature. So I'll tell you, the goal of Alec and his team is to trade as accretively as possible. But on the other hand, not to be fooled by that initial cap rate and to be thinking hard about the long-term return on the asset. Thank you, Rich. And Rich, just to add a little bit, it's Mark. The general rule you should think about here is that when you're doing concessions, and we were in a concessionary environment for a while, at the beginning, when you're issuing large amounts of concessions, your concession fully net effective number for revenue will be higher than it would be on a cash basis. We're now at the tail end of that where these concessions are going away, and that means that the opposite is now generally true and that you're doing a little bit better on the other direction. So your GAAP number is generally not doing the same. So that's just so you understand the trade. So when we disclose on Page 12, as Bob said, that for the full year, the difference is 4.6 GAAP versus negative 3.2 cash. You're effectively going to have that thing switch around a little bit. You're not going to have concessions improving your number like you did. You're going to have concessions hurting your numbers slightly. And that's what it does. So I think our cash number is 80 basis points lower. So just to be clear, you will get all of that change. It's just a matter of when. And that depends on, as Michael said, the lease maturity schedule, a little bit of regulatory pressure, those sorts of things. But you'll get the whole thing unless the market changes. It's just whether it's all this year or a little bit falls into 2023. And maybe we'll give a little bit more precision and Bob will help me. It's Mark here because I'm just playing CFO now. I'm not actually doing that job anymore. But our \u2013 in the old days before the pandemic, our bad debt write-offs are generally 40 or 50 basis points of revenues. They obviously went up considerably during the pandemic. And now you're getting these pretty variable numbers because of these \u2013 the great job Michael and the team have been doing with our residents of getting some of this government rental relief money. So the question on the run rate is probably a number that's in the 1.5% range for the year because it's still \u2013 there still are eviction restrictions and where they aren't, there's just slow processes. And there's just still some stuff the system needs to work through, Nick. So our sense is it's higher than a normal year but considerably lower than the 2.7% or so we were feeling through most of 2020. Is that a good enough number, Bob? Yes. I mean, we're in that latter camp, Brad, it's Mark, about value staying, give or take where they are. I think interest rates going up are pretty manageable for value. So you think about the customary spread, and we talked about this on the last call of between the 10-year treasury and prevailing apartment cap rates of being 200 basis points give or take, and you imagine the Fed moving short rates and long rates responding and you wonder if the cap rates should go up. And I guess \u2013 given how durable multifamily cash flow has proven to be even during what was, I think, the biggest crisis in the industry's history in the last few years. I mean, we were hit pretty hard and we're right back in two years and on a good growth trajectory and the great prospects going forward. I feel like that bit of a risk premium is going to decline a bit. I also think there's a wall of capital that I know you're well familiar with that wants into real estate and specifically into apartments. I heard that number quoted as all sorts of different numbers, but it seems to be at least $100 billion or more. So I think that creates a floor as well. So our sense is that as long as interest rates going up, doesn't crush growth and take the whole economy into a serious recession. Values will remain pretty good. And I also think you're going to get both real and nominal cash flow growth. So I think your NOI that you're applying your cap rate too, is going to improve as well over the next few years. And timing, right, not all leases expire, Alex, on January 1. That's the other. So you got to \u2013 so it's a little \u2013 it's Mark, it's a little bit of both. I mean certainly, there's some regulatory restrictions, particularly in Southern California, but there's also just timing. We don't \u2013 our leases don't overrule January 1. So what we do is that we get that money the next year. So that is going to contribute to 2023. And just to talk about the concession. I mean we did take all that pain through the system. Our shareholders felt that. So the fact that there is some concession makeup. I mean that is real cash flow we didn't get that we will get. So it isn't \u2013 I don't think you're implying this, but it isn't an accounting charge. It is a true cash flow reduction we had that we're now getting back. Well, I'm going to \u2013 it's Mark. Just to ask a question. The 3.7 we quote you, the disposition yield is what we think forward cash flow is based on the price we sold it at. So it is what EQR would have gotten if we had kept these assets. So if you're talking about what our historic book value is, just to give you a sense of perspective because we just had this conversation with our Chief Accounting Officer, I mean, this company is very good at investing in apartments, so we have half the book basis or so of, I guess, compared to the actual sale price and most of that, the vast majority of that is in depreciation. It's actual gain on sale. So I don't know if that's helpful perspective to you, but the book value, it's fair to say is about half. But I'm not sure why the book value is terribly relevant. And the 3.7 is a good reflection of the cash flow EQR gave up. Is that helpful? Yes. I don't know about double because, again, you're failing to mark the asset to market. If you \u2013 I mean, we don't operate on a historic basis here. You don't look at an asset and say, it's only worth its net book value. It can be worth more or less. And in our case, it's often worth more. So I'm a little confused by the comparison of net book value using that as your denominator with cash flow as your numerator. I think cash flow forward is your numerator and your denominator is what you sold the asset for you think the asset is worth at the moment, right. Thank you. Well, we're probably feeling a little better in a couple of places. I certainly think in New York, the new mayor seems to have been elected by a populist that wants practical problem solving government in New York and is thinking about the crime issue in a good, thoughtful way. So that's \u2013 we think that's positive. The governor has a lot of experience with real estate and understands how market factors work in real estate. So that \u2013 so probably feel smidge better in New York. I would say 1 thing in California, there will be an expiration shortly of a prohibition on local eviction moratoriums. And we do have some concern about that. I mean that is something we do think about. We think the time has passed for those sorts of emergency measures justified by COVID and that the system needs to adjust itself. And if there's going to be a need to keep people in homes of that sort, then the government should fund those kind of programs with enhanced vouchers or whatnot. But that's probably the thing that's foremost in our minds. And like I said, I think I feel a little better about New York, maybe not a lot, but a little in terms of the policymaking and then we'll continue to keep our eye on good cause eviction as well. And in some of our other markets, again, there seems to be more focus on quality of life and concerns of that sort, whether it's in Seattle or the city of San Francisco, and we welcome that as well. Haendel, it's Mark. I'm going to start with the timing, and I'm going to leave Alec to talk about what's going on in the California sales side. So it will take a few more years. I mean, $2 billion is our goal on buys and sells. There was a lot of products sold towards the end of 2021. And so 2022 is not yet that busy, that's pretty common for the first quarter to be a little quieter. We'd love to do more than $2 billion, but we'll do only as much as makes sense on both the buy and the sell side. So I think you should expect this to take several more years to fully effectuate. But I'd say, in the meantime, the holders are going to get the benefit of the strong recovery in our established markets. And so again, we're going to continue to own a lot in New York, and New York is going to be a terrific market in 2022. And then you'll see our exposure to that market drop over time. And I think, hopefully, that will be well timed with improvements in performance in some of the Sunbelt markets that we're adding exposure. And so I think it is going to be a couple more years for sure until we get to that balance I've spoken of. I apologize. I didn't \u2013 that broke up a little. Would you repeat that question? Absolutely. If there was an opportunity of that sort, we'd be all over it. But a lot of the portfolios we've seen that have traded or been offered for trade have all sorts of frailties. They're either a lot older product or they're in the wrong place or both. And they may have a few of the assets we want, but we're looking to try and make trades that move that goal along. Listen, we're open to buying assets, frankly, anywhere that makes sense if we get a great price. And this is not a market where you're getting a great price. So otherwise, you need to have it make sense relative to the strategy. So we'd love a portfolio acquisition. Alec and his team are super focused on that. We've not seen a lot of those opportunities that were in our wheelhouse come by. Well, there's a lot in there, and I don't know if some of the rest of the team might contribute to the answer. I mean I have two Gen Zers sitting in my house that I very much want to get out there launched. And we see that cohort as very large. And I think with \u2013 we hope sensible immigration policies. I'm not sure it will end up being much smaller or smaller at all than the millennial generation was. So besides the raw numbers, there's also what percent of those people are captured in the apartment rentership world versus home ownership or single-family rentership. And I think we're going to capture and continue to capture a fair amount of these millennials. I mean it's been well documented that a lot of those folks have pretty good P&Ls, pretty good earnings power. But not necessarily a lot of savings to put down the purchase homes. And so a lot of those folks are going to stay longer with us, and they value that flexibility from rentership. So our sense, and again, we've seen research on this is that even though the ownership percentages have been going up and millennials are certainly part of that, I think we're going to continue to have a pretty good share of that millennial population even as it ages. Our average renter is 33 years old in our portfolio. So it's a little older than some of our competitors. So I think we are still approaching the high watermark for the millennial generation in terms of the largest single year of population. So that all feels good. I think the runway for demographics and apartments is really good. In terms of going into the single-family business, we're a residential company. We think about all those things all the time. But what we have in front of us is this really good opportunity to build 12-or-so market portfolio in the best places for affluent renters to live in the U.S. We're really good at managing apartments, and we're good at that. We can be good at other things, too. But I think what we have in front of us is an opportunity to really trade out of some of the older product and maybe regulatory challenged product and move into apartments. That seems like that's right in front of us. I wonder if that isn't the opportunity for us right now as opposed to trying some new things, especially since those new things aren't cheap. So I think single-family is certainly analogous property type and plenty of our ex employees have worked there in pretty senior roles. So we know a fair bit about it. And we think about it a fair bit. But it isn't something that, from my perspective, is the immediate opportunity. Thanks Haendel. We're open to joint ventures. There are some places where we're probably more open to them. For example, the city of San Francisco with very high transfer taxes, maybe a place we're selling part is better. Selling twice as much in halves is better than selling one whole. So I guess, Michael, we are open to it. That's a different pocket of money. We have conversations. We know all those people. If an asset just needs to be sold, we want to sell it. We don't want to put a partner into an asset that we think will be challenged, but there are certainly assets we're just overexposed in the submarket and we just like to have a little less exposure. So we're open to that, and we've had those kind of conversations. But honestly, the market to sell 100% has been so darn good. We've just gone ahead and done that. But we're open to that. And the most important part of that is we found more to buy, then we'd like hit the switch on everything, JVs and larger portfolio dispositions and all of that. So the big limiter on doing one of those trades is all of a sudden, Alec, would get $600 million of cash that he need to reinvest in 90 days in a bunch of new great apartments. And that Michael, probably, concerns me most is how we would go about finding that new product, more than anything else. Yes. Well, I mean, we do intend to grow. The development engine, we hope, will create some growth. We're open to the suggestion you made. It's again finding things to buy. If there was a lot to buy out there, Michael, and we might be very interested in using debt. We have a lot of debt capacity, maybe a little bit of equity and start buying, we'd love to get bigger. That's \u2013 we think this is a great time to be in the apartment business and would love to have both asset and cash flow growth. We'll get a lot of cash flow growth from just the existing business. So I'd tell you on both of your very good questions. The limiter is more our opportunity set not us wanting to pull those levers. We'll pull the JV lever, we'll pull the equity lever, if there was a lot of great things to buy. With it being such a tough market to acquire in, the trading activity has been probably a better way for us to go. And we'll react to the opportunity set that presents itself. I mean I appreciate the comment because you're right, we are transactionalists. We're good at doing large deals. We know how to integrate assets 50 at a time or more into the portfolio. But again, I don't see that opportunity set out there. So I guess it's hard to react in the abstract to that. But I'd rather be done with this process. That part, I agree with you. EQR would rather be done with the realignment process, but we're not in such a hurry that we'll do it by buying lower quality assets. See you there. Yes, it's Mark. It's kind of just in our model. It can be either one. But like this year, we didn't have any. And our goal with Alec is to not have any again or for it to be accretive. But it can be from either. It can be from selling early in the year and thus having more disposition NOI gone or it could be from buying early in the year and having more accretion just by virtue of that. So either or, I guess, I'd tell you. You just take 25 basis points, multiply it by $2 billion that's the negative drag somewhere in EQR's P&L model on this activity. Thank you. Well, thank you all for your time today. We look forward to seeing many of you in person at the conferences that are coming up and in your offices over the next few months. Thank you very much. Stay well."

            "name": "Alec Brackenridge",
            "content": "Hey Nick, this is Alex Brackenridge. And yes, so we feel like the assets we're buying will have higher IRRs over time. It's a combination of both higher top line rent growth but also less capital demands over time as well. So we feel like we're in a point in time where we have an opportunity to have a really good trade of selling these older properties into newer properties in these markets that are very, very robust. Just that it keeps getting bigger. The multifamily is clearly a favorite asset class. And we see people that had gone away coming back. And certainly, in our coastal markets that were quiet or like New York, it's full bore. I mean people that we're investing only in office are now investing in apartment, people that went down south have come back north. So it's a competitive bid both for what we're selling and for what we're buying. That's a hard question for me to answer in specific, as on every deal is a little different. Every rent roll, obviously, is different. There's a lot of still to be picked up rent growth in both what we're buying and selling. But you're getting it kind of in a different way and some of the things we're selling, there's still maybe some pandemic recovery. And what we're buying, generally, there wasn't a big pandemic downturn. But there's still \u2013 the market has moved so quickly. You still have leases under. So net-net, we feel really good about the short and medium-term growth of these expansion markets, but it's coming from a different source. Sure, and this is Alec. So what we're seeing \u2013 and we haven't broken ground on anything in our joint venture with Toll, yes. I don't have any Toll-specific information on something that's under construction. But I can say that for the projects that we're working on with other partners, it's a question of timing, right. So things have pushed out by a matter of months but it's not whether or not the project gets done. And that's true of us and many of our competitors as well. So people are getting around the supply chain challenges, either by finding substitute products or warehousing the inventory that they need. So costing a little more, taking a little more time. But on the other hand, rents have been rising. So I'm not sure yields in most cases, have materially changed. The other thing that we would say is we are in a different business, apartment construction versus single-family home construction. I mean that's more of an assembly line at a moment. You just need 1,000 windows, you need them right now. And for us, we have longer cycle times. It's a lot longer period of time to build an apartment building than a single single-family home. So maybe you don't have the windows, but maybe you have all the dry wall you can do or whatever the situation is. You can kind of manage things a little bit better than I think you probably can if you just can't deliver the house at all because you just don't have a key component. Well in apartments, you can go to a different stage in the process, at least sometimes and knock that out. This is Alec. Yes, we're working on growing that pipeline. $450 million was a kind of jump-starting our program, which was helpful to that Toll had these three projects ready to go. But we're hoping to grow that to $1 billion or $1.2 billion over time. This year it will probably be somewhere between the $450 million and $1 billion. Thank you. We're seeing flow cap rates kind of across the board. We're also a very tactical seller, right. So if a market has not got a lot of bids in a particular \u2013 last year, we didn't feel like New York \u2013 there was a lot of interest in New York. So we didn't sell. Now we're feeling differently. We have a property under contract, and we'll get a low cap rate on that. And but investor interest is broad across the markets, and we're going to continue to match sources and uses here with the dispositions paying for the acquisitions, as Mark said, at roughly the same cap rates. Thank you. And as to investor \u2013 and this is Alec. As investor interest in California, we see both newer transactions that we're typically looking at buying, and it's been a very full bidding tent for that. And also the older stuff that we're selling into such a slightly different buyer in many cases, more value-add focused. Also a lot of interest. The exception to that is really downtown San Francisco. There has not been a significant trade. And right now, I think the market has to continue to recover both from a rent level, which it's starting to do but also from investor appetite. It's somewhat analogous to New York, where 12 months ago, we felt the same way we needed to wait on that before we sold any property there. And San Francisco is a little lagging behind that, but that is the market where you just don't see much sales transaction. Otherwise, it's very robust."

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Rather than go through a detailed review of our guidance assumptions, which are laid out on Page 4 and Page 27 of the release. I thought I'd take a moment to elaborate on our approach to innovation, our continued investment in our platform and how that's playing out in our financial statements in 2022 and going forward. Over the last couple of years, we've had impressive results in our innovation journey, and it's not over. A few highlights that our property management and operations teams have been busy rolling out. We brought mobility to both the service and sales teams to enable and enhance flexibility. We have artificial intelligence handling 80% of our communication with prospects to lower cost and provide 24/7 service. We've deployed roommate matching functionality on our website to drive additional revenue, and we've moved 97% of our tours to self-guided or virtual, all while increasing our gross rent potential by using data and analytics to improve our amenity pricing. These are only some of the examples of how we continue to advance our efforts to maximize efficiencies on site and improve revenue while meeting the ever-evolving expectations of our residents. We have done so successfully through adjusting our processes, deploying new technology like the artificial intelligence I mentioned and through advancing our use of data to inform our business decisions. We have most visibly seen financial benefit from these endeavors and our ability to successfully minimize our on-site expense growth, particularly payroll. In 2021, we reported negative on-site payroll after reporting less than 1% growth in the prior two years, and we're just getting started. Our focus moving into 2022 continues to be building upon the success we've already achieved. That means continuing to improve our digital customer experience, our business processes and to advance our sophistication and data-driven decision-making tools. This is an area in which we have historically been a leader and expect to continue to excel at going forward. Our approach remains focused on efficiency, marries technology and data and should reduce exposure to expense pressures while increasing revenue growth. In order to accomplish this, we're making investments in foundational areas like centralized teams, IT infrastructure and licensing and data analytics, which is driving a good portion of our forecasted overhead growth in 2022. These investments enable our progress in our innovation journey and have significant ROI that should continue to garner margin improvement benefits in 2022 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to the operator for the Q&A session. Hey Nick, it's Bob. We're roughly assuming maybe slightly below half of what we got in 2021. So in 2021, just to remind the group, we received about $34 million. And so we expect the programs to kind of start tailing off as we go. So about half of what we got in 2021. Yes. Hey John, it's Bob. I'll take a stab at this, and I'll piggyback with Michael, if there's anything. I think when you think about the range on the revenue guidance side, and Michael outlined in his script a little bit, most of the growth is coming from rate, right. And there's different flavors that you just outlined in terms of rate. A lot of that rate is kind of, I'll call it, baked in because it's capturing that existing loss to lease, et cetera. The way you get to the low end of the guidance range is that you don't get as much intra-period market rent growth during 2022, right. So if you think about it as we kind of continue on the pricing trend, the low end would imply that we don't get much intra period. The higher end would imply that we get more intra period than what we otherwise anticipated. And the midpoint is slightly above trend, above historical trend intra period growth. And that's how you kind of balance the range. The range is a little wider than what we've historically done because I do think there is a little bit more potential for volatility given what's out there. But those are kind of the low end, the middle and the high. Yes, Rich. Let's talk through this a little bit. So let's talk just straight on a cash basis kind of what we're assuming in the 2020 revenue number. So in 2021, right, you had call it, $27 million, which we disclosed on Page 12 of cash concessions. We're assuming at the midpoint of our guidance that we have significantly less concessions in that, right. So this is all cash to cash, right. And so therefore, we're thinking that we're going to normalize something back to normal. It's not quite the 4Q annualized, but it's something in that general ballpark that we're assuming at the midpoint. So what's happening, I think, is the inverse of what you just talked about. So in 2021, the GAAP number was negatively impacted by concessions. In 2022, it will benefit from concessions, right. So the cash number on a year-over-year growth rate basis should be a little bit lower than the midpoint that we had in our guidance range. And based on the numbers that I just outlined to you, it should be, call it, 60 basis points lower at the midpoint than the 9% that we just gave. It's about 70 basis points lower than the nine at the midpoint. So you've got more like an 8.3 on a cash basis year-over-year than the nine. Yes. So hey, Nick, it's Bob. Let me talk about the kind of two competing factors that go into that number as we think about how we modeled it in 2022. So one of the competing factors is the rental assistance, right. So rental assistance, which I think we talked about a little bit earlier on the call, we'll reduce that number, and we do expect that to trail into 2022 because the programs are not completely done. And we would expect that to be front half, right. And so that will benefit you on the front half basis. The opposite competing factor is just the actual resident behavior in terms of who's paying, who's not paying and how that kind of progresses. We do expect a benefit for that to occur, but that's probably more back half loaded. So what I think you're going to end up having, depending on how this all plays out is something that's pretty constant, maybe a little sub-2% level that will be kind of throughout the years as you go through the quarter. But those are your two factors that are driving kind of the bad debt. We do think on an absolute basis the bad debt will be lower with both those factors in 2022 relative to 2021. Yes. So even more specific. So we have, call it, $30-odd million of bad debt net of rental assistance in 2021. A normal year to Mark's point, would have been something more like 10%. We won't get all the way back to the 10%, but we might get close to halfway there in 2022. So we'll add something that's, call it, $15 million to $20 million of bad debt is what we've included in our guidance. Yes. So let's start with the biggest category because it is \u2013 we expect it to continue to be a help as it was in 2021, which is real estate taxes. So real estate taxes, we do expect to grow below trend. And a lot of that has to do with timing as well. So some of the real estate jurisdictions are not on calendar years, so they're on different fiscal years. So we've already got like locked and assessed values that are lower or rates that are lower or just the general health of the jurisdiction is better. So we have a little bit of that continuation kind of flowing through. So we'd expect real estate taxes to be more around a 2% kind of growth rate than maybe in 2019 or historical and real estate taxes were more three to four. So that will drive some of the assistance. The payroll, I think you already hit upon. Utilities and R&M will be probably mixed, will probably be a little above average. I think that depends on a variety of factors on how it flows through on utilities with commodity prices and other areas where we've seen a little bit of relief as of late. A lot of the utility price we're able to pass back to the resident. So it's more of a geography than a kind of net-net impact overall. But it's the combo of good expense controls and initiatives associated with payroll, continuing to manage the R&M piece and then also benefiting from real estate taxes. Yes. So in fairness, and I'll let Michael chime in here. Most of the investments that yielded the results in 2021 related to the AI and other things were actually spent in prior years. There's a little bit of chicken and egg thing. So typically, what you see is investment in the overhead or technology like the AI, which by the way, was relatively inexpensive, I think, sub $1 million. You see that investment happen first as the enabler, and then you begin to see the reduction in the on-site kind of payroll or the change in the staffing. And so then when you move forward to 2022, we're in that position where we're once again in a phase of investment in the technology, and that's a lot of what our above-trend overhead growth that I alluded to in my comments is driven on. It's a lot of tech, it's some centralization of staffing, et cetera. So there's, call it, maybe $4 million or $5 million at least embedded in kind of the prop management growth rate. You're seeing some of that come out again in the 2022 numbers. But a lot of it is the investment into 2023 and 2024, and you've seen in some of our presentation decks, what we think the growth potential of that. When we make these investments that are going between geographies, just so you know, it's a very ROI-focused. Geographies don't matter, bottom line and cash flow do. And so what we look to do is to invest in technology or invest in centralization that gets a positive ROI overall regardless of geography. Yes. So that related to a specific parcel of land and you can notice looking at our balance sheet, we don't have much land at all. But it related to a specific parcel of land in downtown Los Angeles that we no longer anticipate pursuing from a development standpoint. We obviously do a very thorough review of our land bank and all our assets from an impairment standpoint periodically and that change in intent is largely what drove that charge. Thank you. Yes. So if you think about kind of \u2013 and I'll use maybe 2018, 2019 is like typical, right. So typical for this business kind of trend would have been something in the high 2s, low 3s in terms of rent growth and it tends to start \u2013 you start a little bit in the first quarter. You build in the second quarter at the beginning of the lease season. You peak in the third quarter and then you typically have a little bit of a sequential rent decline as you get to the fourth quarter. So that would be a typical kind of pricing trend as you looked in other years, right. Now from a revenue standpoint, you're obviously not going to capture all of that because we talked about you don't write all your leases on 1:1. You have \u2013 you maybe capture half of it based on the outlook, what I outlined in terms of actual revenue performance in a given year. So that's kind of what I think about in terms of trend. What we've assumed in our 2022 guidance is that we follow that kind of same shape of the curve but that is a little bit above trend, right, that we continue to see that strength and it is a little bit higher than trend. If that is much above trend, right, is something that is approaching more like the mid-single digits or even above, that's going to push your guidance range \u2013 your guidance results to the \u2013 or your actual results to the high end of the guidance range. If you're below that, call it, three that I was saying trend and you get kind of no growth, that will push you down towards the bottom end of the range."

Please go ahead, sir.\nMartin McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Third Quarter 2021 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer are here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release as well as a management presentation regarding our results and outlook are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that one of our peers is hosting their call at 1 pm Central, and so we want to be conscious of everyone's time, and we'll look to finish the call in 1 hour. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Marty, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I'll give some brief remarks on a terrific pace of our operating recovery and our robust investment activity then Michael Manelis will follow with some top-level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see next year playing out, and then we'll take your questions. We have talked about 2021 being a year of recovery for our company. And we are very pleased to report that our operating metrics continue to recover at a faster rate than we assumed back in July with quarter-over-quarter same-store revenues turning positive for the first time since the pandemic began. Strong demand across our markets drove us to achieve physical occupancy of 96.6% in the third quarter, which allowed us to continue to push rental rates. We also benefited from governmental rental relief payments made on behalf of our tenants. As a result of these strong continued operating metrics, we have raised our annual same-store revenue, net operating income and normalized FFO guidance again this quarter. We now expect our same-store revenues to decline 3.7%, our expenses to increase 3.25% and NOI to decline 7% for the full year of 2021. We expect to produce normalized FFO per share of between $2.95 and $2.97, a 2% increase at the midpoint. All of this leaves us very well positioned going into 2022. While we won't provide guidance for next year until our next earnings release in February, in our management presentation you can find the building blocks that point to our business being set up for an extended period of higher-than-trend growth beginning in 2022 as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes resulting from a very strong job market. We expect same-store revenue growth in 2022 to exceed the historical mid-single-digit range that has characterized past recoveries, leading to some of the best same-store revenue numbers we have ever seen. These expectations assume that the economic backdrop remains constructive and the pandemic remains controlled. Please also note that while we expect to do very well next year, we will not be able to make up our entire mark-to-market on our rent roll and regain our entire loss to lease in a single year for a variety of marketing and regulatory reasons that Michael will describe in a moment. Beyond 2022, we see a continuing bright future for our business as the large emerging Gen Z cohort starts their careers and joins the renter population. Also, the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward. Switching to the transaction side of the business. The positive story on fundamentals has not gone unnoticed by the investment community as the overall theme continues to be enormous amounts of capital pursuing all types of apartment investment, driving cap rates to new lows. This has caused the convergence in nominal cap rates in the 3.5% or so range for many markets and has created a positive climate for our strategic repositioning efforts. We continue to aggressively sell our older and less desirable properties at these low cap rates and at prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates, acquiring much newer assets in our expansion markets of Dallas Fort Worth, Austin, Atlanta and Denver and the select suburbs of our established markets at approximately equal cap rates. All of the assets we are acquiring share the common characteristic of being recently built, having no or minimal retail and being attractive to our target affluent renter demographic. We like that these trades are not dilutive to current earnings while adding properties to the portfolio that we believe will have better long-term cash flow growth, lower capital needs and diversification benefits. Year-to-date, we have purchased more than $1 billion of properties and expect to close another $400 million or so in acquisitions mostly in our expansion markets, a good number of which are in various stages of advanced negotiation already, all by year-end. We have funded these buys with an approximately equal amount of dispositions of older and less desirable assets, which we sold at an average premium of 10% to our pre-pandemic estimates of value. Included in these sales are approximately $900 million of California assets. Currently, approximately 42% of our total assets are in California. As we seek to have more balance in our portfolio, you should expect our California exposure to decline over time, but to remain meaningful. Turning to development. We had a lot of great news in the quarter. It all starts with the apartment development joint venture with Toll Brothers, the public homebuilder that we announced in August. We have known and respected the team at Toll for many years and have successfully partnered with them before. They built terrific properties and have a large team spread across our expansion markets and select of our other markets that we expect to leverage in this joint venture to create quality properties for equity residential to own long term. The venture is off to a quick start as we closed already in this fourth quarter on 1 Toll land opportunity and are working with them on many others. We also have a strong internal development team in our company that continues to create opportunities. In this quarter, that team completed the development of our Edge property in Bethesda, Maryland. This high-end asset is adjacent to an existing EQR asset and located very near a metro station as well as the large amount of new office space that has recently been built in downtown Bethesda. They also sourced and structured the 3 new joint venture development deals in Washington, D.C., Denver and suburban New York that began construction this quarter. Each of these joint venture development deals is with a different partner and is not related to the Toll venture. Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You're doing an exceptional job during what was a particularly busy leasing season, and we are all very proud and grateful. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark. The entire peak leasing season delivered consistent high levels of demand that allowed us to continue to grow occupancy as well as rates at a pace that exceeded our expectations. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that position this portfolio well for 2022. Occupancy is 96.9% today which is 60 basis points higher than 2019 and 260 basis points higher than the same week in 2020. At this point, we expect to maintain strong occupancy through the balance of the year. Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions grew throughout the entire peak leasing season and is now 28% higher than it was on January 1. The pandemic caused our net effective pricing to decline by $520 from March to December of 2020. And from January 2021 to today that same pricing trend has grown $637 which demonstrates a V-shaped recovery and shows that we have more than fully recovered what we had lost in price. Concession use, which has been a main topic of discussion for the last 18 months is now being used on a very limited basis and in line with pre-pandemic levels, with less than 1% of our applications in September and October receiving an average concession amount of less than 2 weeks. New lease change was up 10.1% in the third quarter and is on track to be just over 11% in October. We have seen signs of seasonal softening, both in terms of pricing power and application volume but these trends are normal to slightly better than typical seasonality patterns. And more importantly, the volume of traffic and applications currently is more than sufficient given the low levels of available inventory we have in the portfolio. Renewals were a major focus for the quarter given the rapid improvement in market pricing from a year ago as well as the fact that we have slightly more expirations in the back half of 2021 than normal. We have been centralizing negotiations for the San Francisco, New York and Boston markets and our offsite call center group as pricing in these markets were the most impacted by the pandemic and conversations in these markets have become more and more difficult as we are dealing with residents who receive large concessions and much lower rates this time last year. The good news is that the results have been great across all of our markets. We renewed 62% of residents in September and October is on track to be just below 65% which is much better than the 55% historical norm that we thought we were going to stabilize at. At the same time, renewal rate achieved has continued to improve with September at 7.7% and October on track to be 9%. We expect continued growth despite what will likely be challenging negotiations. Perhaps our biggest positive from these negotiations is that so far, we are not seeing any material difference in renewal behaviors from the deal seekers who received very discounted rents last year versus our more tenured residents. Overall, they are renewing at similar paces. This is something we will continue watching very closely. Before providing color on a couple of markets, let me touch on our positioning for 2022. As we think about same-store revenue growth, we have some key drivers that should work in our favor. First, our existing leases are at a material loss to lease. What I mean by that is if we snapshot all of our leases in place today and compare them to current market prices, 86% of our residents are paying on average rent that are significantly below current market prices. The result of this is a net effective loss to lease of 13.6%. This provides us with a significant opportunity to increase our revenue as we move these leases to market rates. That of course does not mean that we will capture the full 13% in 2022 largely because leases expire throughout the year not on January 1. And we currently are subject to renewal restrictions in some jurisdictions which means the change is very dependent upon who actually moves out. Regardless, this is definitely the highest loss to lease we have ever seen with such a large majority of leases below market, and the teams are hyper-focused to recapture as much of the loss to lease as possible. Second, we expect that the significant demand and favorable fundamentals in our business will drive additional revenue growth opportunities in all of our markets in 2022. Remember, we have seen unprecedented demand even with only modest return to office activity. So the backdrop for intra-period rent growth expectations in 2022 is strong. Third, we expect to get a nice lift from occupancy in the first half of the year as we were at 95% in the first quarter and 96.2% in the second quarter of this year. We are currently running above 96.5% and would expect to maintain this level or better in 2022. And finally, we have regulatory restrictions that are beginning to expire. This presents an opportunity to recapture revenue through the reduction of bad debt and increased collection of late fees in 2022. All of these factors combined put us in a position to deliver very strong revenue growth next year, assuming regulatory conditions continue to improve and the general economic conditions remain supportive. Moving to a couple of quick market comments. Starting on the East Coast, the New York market not only has fully rebounded, but it continues to have strong demand for our product despite the broader delays in return to office. At this point, New York is positioned to outperform seasonal trends in the fourth quarter. Boston and D.C. are performing as expected, with great demand and strong occupancy with normal seasonality. On the West Coast, Southern California has been and continues to be very strong. San Francisco and Seattle appear to be the 2 markets most impacted by the delay in return to office in terms of overall demand levels but so far appear to be following normal seasonality trends. San Francisco, while demonstrating a good recovery remains the only market that has not yet fully recovered from a pricing standpoint. Occupancy has been improving in San Francisco over the past month or so. And today, we are 96.5% and should be well positioned to capture demand and pricing power once the tech companies begin to provide more clarity around return-to-office plans. Seattle has been a little more volatile than expected. Current occupancy is 95.6%. And while the overall demand level is holding up, the announcement from Amazon a few weeks ago regarding office return decisions has impacted our leasing velocity. Our on-site teams in Seattle mentioned that prospects definitely have a lack of urgency to lease, but are very interested in options for later this year or early next year. Moving on to expenses. Mark mentioned our same-store expense guidance at 3.25% for the full year. We are seeing increased costs across all utility categories. However, about 65% of these costs are ultimately passed back to residents through the utility reimbursements that run through the revenue line. We are also seeing pressure on wages in this very tight labor market but have been successful in mitigating growth in our on-site payroll numbers by realizing staffing efficiencies. These efficiencies have been achieved through the numerous innovation initiatives that we have rolled out over the past year or so. This includes moving to self-guided tours, online leasing and utilizing our artificial intelligent leasing agent named Ella. On the service side, we also leverage our service mobility platform and new technology to deliver the experience and service that our customers require which is evident by the all-time high online reputation Google rating of 4.2 all while also reducing the expense pressures. We expect these efficiencies and opportunities to accelerate into 2022 as we continue to harness technology to deliver the customer experience that our residents require. Finally, I will end on an update on the rent relief recoveries. Fortunately, our affluent resident was less impacted by the pandemic as they kept their jobs and continue to pay rent. For those that were impacted we have continued to work with them, including assisting them and applying for rent relief. We have received $18.3 million September year-to-date in this rent relief with the majority of that coming to us in the third quarter. This exceeds our prior expectations of $15 million recovered in the full year. Even with some of the eviction moratoriums expiring our goal will be to continue working with residents to gain access to the additional rent relief funds. We continue to have good traction in this process and now expect the full year rental relief recoveries of between $25 million and $30 million in 2021. Let me close by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. I'm hoping you can dive into a little more of your 2022 expectations. I know you said the same-store revenue should be among the best in history. How much of that is locked in today in terms of the earn-in? And then you talked a little about trying to capture some of that loss to lease. It won't all come in through 2022, but how are you thinking about getting to that comment about being among the best in the industry?\nMark Parrell: Nick, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. We're not giving '22 guidance, but as you said we did try to lay out how we're thinking about things what the building blocks are, what the team is trying to figure out as we look towards '22. When we made the comment both in the release and in my prepared remarks that it's setting up to be the best year in the company's history. For same-store revenue growth, I do want to give a little context. So a normal and I'll say a normal meaning the last couple of recessions for us have consisted of 2 years or so of negative same-store revenue growth, and we've certainly had that this time. A year or so where same-store revenue growth was right around zero slightly positive, slightly negative, kind of a transition year. And in a couple of years where we compounded 5%, mid-5% same-store revenue growth numbers for high-4s, those kinds of things. Given the earn-in given this loss to lease that we see, we think we're going to skip that transition year and that's a comment I made on the last call as well. We're going to skip right over that zero and head right into a year that's likely to be a fair bit higher than the 5.5% or so number you would think of as a normal second year recovery. The recovery is V-shaped, just like the decline was V-shaped. And so I think what you see here is the confidence the team has given the demand and the occupancy numbers. That's subject to some regulatory flak here and there. We're going to regain a great deal of that loss to lease, but certainly not all of it. And I think a bit of it is going to end up in 2023. And there's just customer relations issues. There's regulatory issues with some of these increases in the size of them. And Michael has done a great job with the team of retaining our residents giving them great service. So hopefully that helps. In terms of locked in, I can't give you a locked-in number. The team is going to need to work the whole year to do that. But it feels like that 5.5% is a bit of a floor in terms of next year's same-store revenue number.\nNick Joseph: That's very helpful. And then you mentioned the compounding in some of those past cycles and maybe we can tie to development. It seems like you're getting at least more active on development. You mentioned the Toll JV and some of the other opportunities. I mean how are you thinking about the beginning of this cycle and getting more into development as you try to model out some of those out years where you'll actually be delivering?\nMark Parrell: Great question. It's Mark again. In terms of the compounding the compounding is going to start with the operations with the NOI from the same-store portfolio. Look at '22 when we've given you some color. And certainly it's hard to look much further in our business. But we do look at '23 and see less supply. There were a lot of deals that were delayed the starts due to the pandemic. And while supply is likely to pick up in '24 our look at proximity of supply and other things makes us feel like we got at least a couple of years here, pretty good numbers coming at us on the same-store NOI. And that will always be the big engine at EQR. Development to us is just a great complement to our efforts to acquire assets especially in these newer markets, these suburban markets. And we feel like right now, our shareholders are getting paid to take that risk with our ability to underwrite development yields at around 5 on current rents. And all of these acquisitions we're looking at being in the mid-3s. We're trying to be very thoughtful. This is an inflationary climate, and construction costs are far from immune to that. But I think you're going to see growth both from the same-store portfolio and from actual net growth of the company through development that we're likely to fund with a combination of incremental debt, net cash flow, which we'll have more of starting next year and occasional asset sale and a little bit of equity like we did this quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for all the details on the revenue components. I actually have a few questions on the cost structure of the business. Bob, could you give us the expense pressures hitting some other property types in the REIT world. Could you give us a sense on how bracket a reasonable worst-case and best-case scenario for same-store expense growth over the next 12 months?\nRobert Garechana: I mean I'm not going to probably give specifics in terms of a range because we're not providing guidance yet. But maybe a little bit to think about the components that are running through and where they're positioned as we go into 2022 if that helps, John. So you think about the big 4 categories real estate taxes we've had a good amount of success. That's 40% of expenses. We've had a good amount of success so far on appeals. I think we're not seeing a ton of pressure from the municipalities. And I think that could carry over into another pretty good year into 2022. So pretty good year means in my mind kind of sub that 3-ish or 3.5% kind of regular run-rate inclusive of 421as and other things. On the payroll side, we've done an excellent job I think of managing what has been an inflationary kind of pressure over time. We're going on our third year of payroll that is sub 1% in terms of growth. So what Michael is doing sometimes quietly on the side in terms of managing innovation and doing new implementation is really offsetting what I think is something that every company is experiencing, which is payroll pressure. And we've been really good at it thus far. And I don't think there's anything that's likely to change in a significant way. It means that we feel the pressure. We're just doing things in a different way and innovating in a way to really offset that pressure. The last 2 categories, which are R&M and utilities I think, are the ones that we're most focused on outside of like the payroll side. A big chunk of them can be passed back to the residents, but we're certainly all seeing commodity pressures. You saw what that gap has done kind of recently. And that's the one that I think is where you see higher single digits. But put it all into the blender, I don't think that 2022 is that outsized relative to what we've seen historically in this business over time.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. That certainly helps. Maybe Michael, 1 quick one. Just in terms of the posture on renewals. Could you share the renewal rate increases you're signing out today?\nMichael Manelis: Sure. So this is Michael. And I'll tell you that for November, our net effective quotes were coming in or going out at 12.8%. And the December quotes are 13.2% on a net effective basis. And you could see that number is going to continue to grow, and it's going to widen because concession use was really ramping up this time last year. So you're coming up against more and more of those residents that had concessions. About 25% of all the offers that went out for November and December went to residents that had concessions. And I think, as I said in my prepared remarks so far the deal-seeking residents that we took in last year, they've been renewing at the same pace as compared to those that didn't have concessions. So we're really excited about kind of working our way through the renewal performance for the balance of the year.\nJohn Pawlowski: Understood. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower of Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Just a quick follow-up on development. So you started 3 new projects. Last quarter you delivered 1 of them. Obviously, the Toll joint venture is earmarked for several of your expansion markets. So how easy is it to crank up the development machine internally? And what volume of starts do you think that we can sort of expect over the next few years in that regard? And then if you had to peg a mix between on balance sheet or I should say, in-house versus the Toll joint venture? How would you see that breaking out?\nMark Parrell: Hey, Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start. And then I'm going to give it over to Alec. So in terms of how big it can get it will take a little while to ramp up. Our expectation is this could get to $1 billion to $1.2 billion a year of starts in a year or so and maybe $700 million of that is Toll and the rest of it is other JVs and the stuff that we create internally. I think that, that will be funded in a way that will make that a pretty accretive thing. But most importantly for us, it's creating and giving us product again in markets and submarkets we just don't have enough exposure. So I think Alec can speak a little bit to things the internal team is doing because they're very active. They're doing a lot of good stuff. We got some great densification deals we haven't talked a lot about. So I'm going to let him speak to that. And hopefully, that gives you the color you need.\nAlexander Brackenridge: Thanks, Mark. Rich, this is Alex. Yeah, so we look at a lot of deals. We are a selective developer. And whether it's through the Toll JV, which has been off to a great start. They have a great pipeline and we're actively engaged with them on each project and assessing whether it fits for us. And then as Mark mentioned, we have these densifications throughout our portfolio, largely in California but in other markets as well. And we have a great internal expertise on how to assess and execute on. So we're excited about that. And then as we've mentioned in the release, we're continually looking at other joint venture opportunities outside of Toll. So we have a broad range of projects that we look at and are very selective on the ones we pick.\nRich Hightower: Okay. Great. I appreciate the color, guys. And 1 quick follow-up. Just in terms of the recent acquisitions in the expansion markets. Can you give us a sense of where you're acquiring those properties versus replacement cost in addition to the yield which you have provided?\nAlexander Brackenridge: So it's a range, depending a lot on the project. And this concept of replacement cost is an important metric. It's something we look at but it's not an absolute thing. It's actually a little bit more challenging to calculate than you might think because you don't always find an apples-to-apples and may be a location that's really almost impossible to find similar product to build - some of the location to build the same kind of product. Parking is another variable. Surface parked, you may have an existing project that has surface parked, but the municipality won't allow you to do that or the project sites too dense. So that maybe you go to a structured parking, which is more expensive where you go underground which is yet more expensive. On top of which there are code changes that can generally make things more expensive and inclusionary housing requirements. So we look at it as a metric we look at, but we assess all of those things on a project-by-project basis and determine whether or not we think it fits based on that and the typical yield parameters that we assess.\nRich Hightower: Okay. So it's hard to sort of peg a percentage discount or premium given everything you just mentioned.\nAlexander Brackenridge: There's no absolute number.\nRich Hightower: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. So I just want to follow up on 1 of those questions that were just asked around your new development projects that you started this quarter through your internal platform. Could you perhaps talk about what are the markets where you will focus your internal development versus the focus coming in from the Toll Brothers JV? Thank you.\nAlexander Brackenridge: So we have - and Chandni, this is Alec. We have specific markets that we've designated through the Toll program that we're going to focus on. And for example, Atlanta is a market that we're very focused on with them. Dallas is another one. There are other markets where they don't have a presence or they're not part of the venture. And so those are areas where we'd be more likely to invest on our own or with another joint venture partner.\nChandni Luthra: Got it. And talking about supply a little bit into next year and perhaps 2023. What are the markets that you're feeling a little better about versus where do you see there could be more crowding especially as you are sort of foraying into all these newer markets? If perhaps you could give some color on that, that would be great. Thank you.\nMichael Manelis: Chandni, this is Michael. Let me just start. I'll give a little bit of kind of the takeaway from 2021, a little bit about what we're seeing from an operations impact in '22. And then I'll let anybody else kind of pick up on some of the newer markets that we just entered. So I think I would start by saying that the tagline for 2021 on supply would be that strong demand greatly aided the absorption of new supply in our markets. D.C. produced record levels of Class A absorption and the South Bay, which we talked about on previous calls in San Francisco. That submarket at 4,000 new units being delivered. It continues on its path of recovery with strong occupancy and very limited concessions like in the stabilized portfolio. And I think we've talked about this before that we are really focused when we think about supply, and the concentration of the supply and the proximity of that new supply relative to our stable assets on top of when are the first units going to actually begin leasing. So for 2021, the overall supply numbers were elevated in our markets. But we said earlier on the call that the overall level of competitiveness against our portfolio was expected to be less. When we look forward, the data for the expected starts in 2022. So relative to this proximity of within 1 and 2 miles of our locations is less, which is a great indicator that we should continue to feel less pressure in the next year or so from the new supply being delivered right on top of us.\nChandni Luthra: Thank you,\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Spector of Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Good afternoon. My first question, Mark, I guess, what held you back from providing '22 guidance at this point?\nMark Parrell: I guess, 17 years of experience doing this job and the CFO job. I mean a lot - this is a pretty variable world. A lot's going on. Certainly, the actions of the Fed on the taper are super relevant to how the economy recovers. So I would say there's just enough variability here. We told you sort of what we know, Jeff, which is this sort of earn-in, this loss to lease. We gave you I think some pretty specific parameters on where things like bad debt might be able to go. And then the big mysteries really are regulatory pressures, how the intra-period growth feels next year. And then where we end this year? I mean we're going to spend the next 2 months continuing hopefully to close some of that loss to lease by writing terrific new leases with happy customers and locking in revenues for next year. So there's just enough variables where any guidance I'd give you would be too wide to be meaningful on same-store revenue. And I think the conversation in February will be much higher quality.\nJeff Spector: That's fair. Thank you. And then second, I know you touched on supply. I don't think I heard the answer on '23. And we're hearing potentially on the coast, a significant decrease in supply in '23. And I'm sorry, again, if I missed this, any early thoughts on '23 supply in your markets?\nMark Parrell: All right. It's Mark. Thanks for that, Jeff. So what we see is a pretty significant decline in '23 a lot - and this is again in deliveries, just to be clear. And that's really as a result of delays in starts or delays in completions of product that was underway during the pandemic. And so we're going to get a break - more of a break in New York, for example, but even that is a little bit by area. There'll be a fair bit delivered in Brooklyn. There'll be a fair bit delivered in the Jersey Coast, but in Manhattan, almost nothing. D.C. will kind of continue doing what D.C. does and deliver a lot. But we're going to feel a lot better about places like San Francisco and Los Angeles and Seattle. So we feel like we're walking into a pretty good setup. When you start thinking about what might deliver in '24, and those are things that are starting now, there is a lot of development activity. The space is in great demand. The investment community hasn't not seen the strong recovery and the stability of the sector. And so we think there'll be a good amount of demand - or excuse me a good amount of supply, but probably more spread out. The market that's most on the watch list of our new markets for supply is certainly Austin. Austin has a lot. We're being very thoughtful about adding exposure there. You may see us slow that down and add it a little bit later. There's just going to be 30,000 units for some number of years there. Atlanta feels pretty good to us on supply. Dallas has supply, but it's spread out and it's a big demand market. So I guess that's the color we'd give you. Denver has a lot of supply too more downtown than otherwise. But again, we have a portfolio we're building that in Denver will be a pretty diversified portfolio when we're done.\nJeff Spector: Thanks, very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to come back to talk about the disclosure that you provided on rental assistance which was really helpful. If I'm looking at the numbers correctly, does it imply that another $10 million to $12 million of rental recovery is going to come in 4Q?\nRobert Garechana: Hey, Rich, it's Bob. That's probably a little bit on the high end of the range. But yeah, I think you're in the ballpark. So we think, as Michael said, for the full year, we'll be at $25 million to $30 million. And we're already at $18 million so far through 9/30.\nRich Hill: Got it. Helpful. And so as you think about 2022, do you think that's going to be a clean year? Or will it also have some rental assistance in it meaning is the same-store revenue number going to be - will it benefit maybe even to the upside from additional rental assistance?\nRobert Garechana: So I think that it probably will benefit from some of the rental assistance and '22 will likely be kind of a transition year. But it also is going to experience this elevated write-off too. Because you still have that is unlike like '19, similar to what we've seen in '21 and '20, right? There's 2 things that will drive bad debt. One is the rental assistance payments; and two is just the ability to start collecting on the units that haven't been collected. And that's a small number for us. It's been a small number given the high-quality renter base that we have. But those are the 2 driving factors that I think are going to make 2022 as kind of bad debt number between what you would have seen in '19 and what we saw in maybe 2021.\nRich Hill: Got it. And would you be willing to maybe frame how much of a headwind that might be?\nRobert Garechana: I think that we'll have a better idea as we get to kind of providing guidance in general. But just to be clear, I don't think it's a headwind. I think it's a benefit to revenue. I think we kind of alluded to that. I think we should be in a better position in '22 than we were in '21.\nRich Hill: Got it. I understand. That makes perfect sense. I thought it would be a long shot but figured I'd ask. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Thanks, everybody. So when you think about the surprising pace of demand improvements. Obviously, the economy turning on after shutting down so rapidly is a big part of it. But related is the opening up of offices. Of course, and universities and people rushing to get back to be close so they can be present when the time comes that they have to be in the office. So assuming you agree with that. Won't it be true that as things settle and you kind of have this - all this stuff be a wash in terms of year-over-year comps that the cadence of 2022 would be super strong year-over-year growth in the first half but a return to earth in the second half? I'm not looking for a guidance question here just sort of speaking out of logic.\nMark Parrell: So Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start and maybe others will contribute. So the rushing back to the office thing. I'd point out, a lot of people are coming back because the city is reopened. They're not sure when they're employers coming back to full time. But they want to be back because they love the lifestyle in West L.A. and they love living in Downtown Seattle. And they want to go back to their favorite coffee shops. And you and I have had this discussion before. I think it's a little bit about return to office, but it's also about just energized cities attracting our kind of residents. In terms of the shape of the curve, I don't think you're wrong about that. I think the numbers early have to be extraordinary because the comp period is so poor in '21 that that's exactly what will probably occur. But what else will be going in the other direction is the normalized FFO by quarter number. Because as Michael's team writes better and better leases, as Bob does this accounting work and roll those numbers up, you're likely to see the earnings power of the firm in the middle part of the year revert back to what it was in 2019. So again, the quarter-over-quarter numbers are going to be exceptional early and they're going to be merely very strong late in the year. But I think what you're going to see besides those operating statistics, Rich, is that quarterly normalized FFO number get better I think, every quarter of next year.\nRich Anderson: We should be focused on FFO anyway, I think but that's just me. And then second question on - is hybrid office like a perfect setup for multifamily? And the reason I say that is people will be more inclined to choose a nicer place to live with amenities and other conveniences just because they're going to be spending perhaps more time there in the hybrid model. Do you agree that hybrid office would be a particularly good thing in the sense you might get more fee income? And with that in mind, why avoid then retail at the ground floor and your new acquisitions? I guess I understand why. But just throw that question at you too on this topic.\nAlexander Brackenridge: Hey Rich, this is Alec. And I think San Francisco is an example where people aren't back in the office, but they still want to be in the cities. To your first part of your question, I think the hybrid model does work well. Because it enables you to do both, enjoy the city and also be close enough to work to get in when you have to go in. So we're seeing the impact of that. And we are working on making our amenities more suited to that. So we've increased a lot of our co-working space within our amenities. And we haven't said no to retail. We like ground floor retail. We like activated streets. We just would like to have a relatively small amount of it compared to the apartment business that we love.\nRich Anderson: Okay, sounds good. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey good afternoon. So I have 2 questions here. First, I don't think anyone asked about the ATM. You guys are not historically an equity issuer. No offense, but $140 million is almost a pocket change for you guys. So curious on your decision to issue equity, especially as it doesn't settle for another year and half, given that you guys are good assets sellers. You're getting cap rates that are commensurate with where you're buying. So just trying to understand how this ATM fits in and should we expect more of it?\nMark Parrell: Alex, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. So we thought it was prudent to dust off the old ATM as you put it and put it to some use here. And it's really about this increase in development spending. So our typical development spending needs the last 3-4 years have been $300 million to $500 million. And here, I'm talking about spending, not start. So of course, they correspond. And we were funding that out of free cash flow and a little incremental debt that didn't change our ratios because you had the new development assets on your books creating income after they were stabilized. Going forward with the idea that we're likely to start $1 billion or $1.2 billion a year after a ramp-up period, you need to be very thoughtful about how you match fund that. And when you look at 2023 we have a pretty significant amount of debt maturities in that year as well. And that's probably the first year we're going to reach this run rate of starts. And so it seemed prudent to us after consulting with the Board to take a little equity into the mix. I think you're right that it will predominantly be funded with free cash flow. And we expect to have that again next year. And hopefully in some good abundance, incremental debt, occasional asset sales as long as we can stay within our taxable income kind of caps. And then we will. I think we will be issuing a smattering of equity here and there given the size of the development expectations for the company in the next few years.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. But still that's - Mark, it's a pretty big shift. So is that the recent addition of new Board members? Or I'm just curious because, historically you guys really haven't been equity issuers. So it does sort of represent a shift in your financing strategy.\nMark Parrell: I guess I don't view it as a shift. It's the same group of people, maybe in different chairs, but it's the same conversations. I mean we don't want to dilute our current investors. That's an important priority. But we do think that when you're creating new assets having a little equity foundationally makes sense. We know what the cash needs are to fund the development pipeline. So the conversation with the board was very easy on this point. They felt that if you were $300 million, $400 million, $500 million a year spender of development, that was 1 thing. If you're going to double it that was a whole another thing. And so that was the real thing that changed, Alex, it's just this magnitude of what the management team is suggesting development can be.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Great. And then the second question, and you probably could guess it. Local New York press is talking about how Governor Hochul was trying to fend off challenges for her reelection from the left. And good cause rent eviction seems to be back, and it seems to almost be given for Albany. Your view, if that goes through is does that change your plans as far as selling down New York more? Or does that make it say like, New York almost becomes like a stable rent foundation market? Or does this mean like, we could actually see our property taxes go down because if they're going to limit rent increases then it's hard for them to raise property tax. So just sort of curious how - because it does look like there's a pretty good chance good cause does pass this time.\nMark Parrell: Yeah. A lot of parts to that question. So I'll try - I'm going to start though with the policy part. That good cause eviction is just rent control by another name. It's bad policy. New York said rent control, you know you live there for - since World War 2 and the housing situation in New York has not improved. This is just going to cause less housing to be built and more disinvestment in existing housing. And there's a lot of better ideas like SP9 in California and 40 B in Massachusetts and some of these zoning reforms in Minneapolis that should have been thought about. So we're disappointed if it indeed is the direction it's going. And we'll work through our association to suggest other better alternatives. But let's assume it does go. It was our intention to lighten the load in New York. I think New York is going to have extraordinary revenue growth next year as a result of just going back to where it was in '19, frankly. And so the idea of putting good cause eviction in where it's going to affect landlords who have been beaten up by the pandemic have property taxes to pay and all the rest seems like particularly bad timing and is going to particularly discourage production. It doesn't make us want to own more in New York City. That's for sure and in New York State. So I guess I'd say it's a negative to investment in the city and in the state. In terms of lower property taxes, I love that idea. They did come with lower taxes than we expected for the most part this year in general. We'll see. I don't know many municipalities that like to keep their property taxes low if they can raise them. So I'm guessing they won't lower them for us enough, Alex to kind of reimburse for what's about to happen if good cause comes through. But again, it's just a bad policy idea, putting aside the impact on EQR and we can respond to it. We'll lighten the load New York, and that's unfortunate. And a lot of other people will do the same thing and there'll be less capital for housing in New York.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, everyone. You talked a little bit about the Bay Area already, but I was wondering if you could put some more color around your expectations as to how the recovery plays out over time. I'm just thinking about it in the context of in New York, you saw occupancy and pricing come back at basically at the same time. But in the Bay, occupancies come back, but pricing really hasn't. So is it as simple as just people with higher incomes needing to come back to work at their tech jobs? Or is there something else going on?\nMichael Manelis: Hey Brad, this is Michael. So I think you have a little bit of everything going on. I think right now, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're pretty well positioned in San Francisco. There is demand coming back to our product. It's just the pricing power wasn't quite where it needed to be to kind of recapture everything that was lost through the pandemic. So I think right now, when you look at the portfolio and you look at how it's positioned. As there's some, I guess, additional clarity around what return to office looks like, the tech companies have been all over the place in that market. So just a little bit more clarity, probably bring some incremental demand. And that most likely will happen after we get into the New Year. And the portfolio that we own right now is very well positioned to capture that demand and recapture some of that rate. When you look at it from a submarket basis, I said a little bit on the deliveries in the South Bay. We thought we were going to have pressure in the South Bay because of the new supply being delivered. We're really holding up really well there. Now the rate hasn't fully recovered, but the rate recovery in the South Bay is better than the rate recovery in Downtown San Francisco. So I think we need a few more months to just see how some of this ambiguity kind of flushes out, and then we'll have a better feel as to what that means for next year.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Perfect. And then on bad debt, you have on the slide some of the potential there. But you also said you don't expect it to really - fully get recovered in 2022. Can you just talk about what some of the impediments are there? I mean is it strictly just eviction restrictions? Or what else would keep it from - what else would make it play out over a longer period of time?\nRobert Garechana: I think it's - it's Bob, Brad. I think it starts with just getting to the point where these residents that haven't been able to pay start making different housing choices or are in a position to start paying. And so that can come in a few forms. It can come in the form of some of the eviction restrictions being lifted. It can come in the form of residents now being employed again because the economy is in a much better spot and they can start paying again. But there's a process that we're all going to have to go through of kind of unwinding this or moving back to kind of a market level, and that's going to take a little bit of time. That's unlikely to be a light switch like activity, especially as we work with residents' kind of figuring that out. And so as a result, I think '22 is going to be that transition year I alluded to. That's probably the biggest thing. And then to add a little bit - to the financial statements, to add a little bit more noise associated with it or make the forecasting harder as I like to say around here. You're going to have the trickle down of the government rental assistance payments because those programs eventually will come to an end as well. So it's really the unwind part of that, that's likely to occur in 2022.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer of Baird.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Starting with the lots to lease. Are you able to provide that number by region? And then can you also quantify how much of your NOI is subject to those regulatory restrictions you mentioned that would constrain our ability to fully realize that loss to lease next year?\nMichael Manelis: Hi, Amanda. This is Michael. So maybe rather than going by every market, I'll just start by saying that the majority of our markets, so Boston, D.C., Seattle, Southern California and Denver, all fall within a range of a net effective loss to lease between 11% and 15% with about 80% plus of the residents in those markets being below market prices. Not surprising, San Francisco has the lowest with a 5.7% net effective loss to lease with 67% of residents paying below current market prices and New York is the highest with 21% loss to lease with 93% of the residents paying below the current market. And as I stated in my prepared remarks the loss to lease is a snapshot of today. And it never has translated into full year revenue growth because you have to work your way through those expirations. And I guess I'll just stop and just say that all of that being said, this is the best position the portfolio has ever been in for the ability to capture it. But I think you need several months into next year to really understand how you're going to translate that into revenue growth and how much of that is going to roll into 2023. And in regards to kind of thinking about the restrictions or the governors. I guess I would say it's really hard to understand because it's so subject to who is actually going to renew, who's going to move out and what your abilities are and what the caps are in place. And there really are so many different programs out there. So it's really difficult to try to quantify that for you.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Okay. That's helpful and makes sense. And then just given the scale of the Toll Brothers JV, are you able to talk more about how the potential buyout would be structured in terms of the implied acquisition yield versus that 5%-plus stabilized development yield that you cited?\nMark Parrell: Hey, Amanda. It's Mark. I'm going to start and Alec may have something. But we're underwriting these deals and generally for Toll to bring them to us is we said they need to be in that 5% yield range on current rents or better. And so right now, Alec and his team are buying at a 3.5% or so cap rate on existing assets. So that's at 3.5% to 5% difference, that 150 basis points or so of margin that again, we think is compensating us for the risk. So when we buy the asset, we will be paying Toll of promote presumably. And so we'll be buying it at a slightly lower cap rate than that 5% in my example, assuming no intra-period rent growth. But again, because of the way the promote is structured and all of that it's not that meaningful a difference. I mean we're 75% of the capital in the deal or the equity capital in the deal. So is that helpful to you?\nAmanda Sweitzer: It is. Appreciate the color.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Mark, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about cap rate conversions to around 3.5% across your markets. And I realize multifamily is a very hot asset class. But with rates rising and now 20% rental growth achieved in many of the submarkets. Are you seeing any upward pressure in cap rates in your markets?\nMark Parrell: Alec give you detail in a second because I have been a little shift here and there. But it's interest rates matter, but fund flows matter more. And fund flows right now are highly favorable into the space because of the performance matters you mentioned. Though there were significant declines in urban apartments, they came back pretty quick. And because the GSEs existing as a financing option that no other sector has. So I think when we look back at our research, there was generally a 200 basis point difference between whatever cap rate we thought we were underwriting on acquisition whatever the 10-year spot treasury rate was. Right now the 10-year spot treasury rate is 1.5%, a lot of what Alec buying is very much close to that 3.7. So it might be a little lower, but it's not a lot lower. So I don't feel like we're that far out of whack. And I do feel like, generally speaking when we look at the whole sort of situation it generally seems to make sense to me. And I don't think that interest rates rising alone as long as cash flows increase will drive values down. But Alec, I don't know if you want to talk about the bidding cash you're seeing?\nAlexander Brackenridge: So John, this is Alec. There are in some cases, slightly fewer bidders showing up at the auction. That's kind of the feedback we get from brokers. But I'll tell you, the pricing hasn't gone down. In fact, it's continued to edge up. So there are some participants who have kind of stepped back and said, Well, I'm not going to win anyway. So I'm not going to spend my time underwriting this, but there's still enough, as Mark says, funds flowing in to make it for a very competitive bid to be able to prevail. On our end, what we're trying and are doing is matching up the timing of our dispositions and our acquisitions. So we're effectively making a neutral bet. We're not going out on a limb. So that's protecting us. And in the sort of spirit of full disclosure on this. A lot of our buyers are leveraged buyers of our assets. So if the Fed raises floating rates, but if they stay still relatively low compared to the cap rates, these are good leverage buys. So that's one of the other thing that continues to force capital into our space.\nJohn Kim: That's great color. Thank you. In your presentation, you talked about maintaining occupancy at high levels for the remainder of the year. And then Michael talked about renewals out at 13% in November-December. Are you basically saying that you're not seeing much resistance to this level of renewal increase and expecting turnover to increase?\nMichael Manelis: This is Michael. So I would tell you, our expectations are the continued success that we've seen in retention will balance out the rest of the year and probably even next year. We're in the mid-60s right now for October even the trends for November are very promising. The increases are getting more significant. We're having more conversations around negotiations, but just feel really positive about the ability to deliver results from that process.\nJohn Kim: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our last question from Rob Stevenson of Janney.\nRob Stevenson: Good afternoon, guys. Given Prop 13, as you continue to trade $1 billion of California assets for $1 billion of Sunbelt, how much is that going to push property taxes up? And are we going to be at elevated same-store expense level because of that going forward. Presumably, you'll have higher revenues to offset that. But is same-store expenses just going to be higher just simply by trading California for elsewhere?\nMark Parrell: And so it's Mark. Just to clarify that, Rob. You mean that in California because of some of these Prop 13 limits, property taxes can't grow as much going forward. I mean in our - as maybe in Atlanta, they wouldn't be bounded by that. Well, I guess I'd say a couple of things. First, for example, in Texas, there's a whole bunch of property tax limitations that are coming into place on both commercial real estate, residential real estate. Alec and his team underwrite these increases. So if cash flow isn't going up net-net, then those assets aren't going to be appealing to us. So I'm not sure what you said is certain because when you say same-store expenses, maybe property taxes go up more. But I'll tell you, California minimum wage is a lot higher. California, all the other compliance costs that go with owning in California are much higher. So I think if you're talking about holistic same-store expenses, I'm not sure I believe, at least for the first 10 years or so of owning a California asset that there's going to be that much of a difference in same-store expense growth. But Alec, do you have a -\nAlexander Brackenridge: Well, the other thing I'd add, Rob, this is Alec is that we're buying properties at on average 2 years old and selling properties that are 30 years old. And that expense load on the older properties tends to accumulate over time. And so that there is a very significant trade-off there.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then the other 1 for me. I don't - I mean it doesn't sound like that you have an exact number. But are you sort of figuring out as a percentage of revenue that you're still losing today as your loss to regulation, executive orders, eviction restrictions? How material in general is that? Is that 1% of your sort of, call it, $625 million of quarterly revenues? Is that 2%? Is that 0.5% in terms of ballpark, how big is that that you're having that you're either foregoing or you're incurring additional expenses to comply with et cetera? How material is that? Or is that an immaterial amount that we should be focused on?\nMark Parrell: It's Mark. I'm going to start and if Bob or Michael have anything they'll add. But I'm on Page 12 of our press release, we give you a bunch of disclosure about residential bad debt and maybe this will bound this up for you. In 2019, our write-offs, so that would be a direct negative against residential revenues were about 40 basis points. That's a good run rate of delinquency in our portfolio rents we never receive and that burden same-store revenue. When you look at what happened last year in '20, where there were no recoveries and the pandemic was 3 quarters of the year and this year, you see on the bottom of 12, we're talking about numbers that are in the 2%, 2.5% range is a headwind. Now the problem we're having is forecasting for you, where between 40 basis points and 2.5% does next year fall. And that depends on how quickly the court's process evictions, our success in continuing to work with our residents, which is always our first goal whether government revenue - government rent relief programs kind of leak, Robert, into next year or mostly are covered this year. So that - hopefully, that gives you a boundary, but that's what we have to be a little general about because there just isn't certainty in our mind and across so many court systems and so many jurisdictions for us to know how all that stuff plays out.\nRob Stevenson: And part of that is also the remainder of the rental assistance, the other sort of $8 million to $10 million that you guys expect in the fourth quarter?\nMark Parrell: Very much so. And you can see what it did to our Q3 number went down to 70 basis points. So we can have a - but yeah, we told you that we continue to collect all but 2.5% or so of our rents. So when we're - that changed a little. It's getting a little better collections are every month from what is still a very good collection level already. But this government money is definitely hard to predict. And then when we can start working with people more directly and getting them into a housing situation that's stable for them long term, I don't know when that is exactly, but we think it's coming up.\nRob Stevenson: Is there anything of any material substance to you that's expiring either at year-end or over the next 3 or 4 months without renewal by either a governor or legislature?\nMark Parrell: So the New York Eviction moratorium we understand expires in the middle of January '22, both commercial and residential. California's statewide eviction moratorium has expired, but there are some city of Los Angeles rules out there still. Boston instituted an eviction moratorium that has no set expiration date. They have an election in a week and then after that we'll see. Seattle has an expiry of their commercial and residential eviction moratorium in the middle of January of '22 as well. So you could see I'm giving you a hodgepodge of dates, there's local overlay. There's a lot going on here. So that's why you're getting a range from us and not the precision that we usually try and give you.\nRob Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Rob. Well, I think that's the end of the call. We're appreciative for everyone's time and attention on the call today. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. The entire peak leasing season delivered consistent high levels of demand that allowed us to continue to grow occupancy as well as rates at a pace that exceeded our expectations. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that position this portfolio well for 2022. Occupancy is 96.9% today which is 60 basis points higher than 2019 and 260 basis points higher than the same week in 2020. At this point, we expect to maintain strong occupancy through the balance of the year. Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions grew throughout the entire peak leasing season and is now 28% higher than it was on January 1. The pandemic caused our net effective pricing to decline by $520 from March to December of 2020. And from January 2021 to today that same pricing trend has grown $637 which demonstrates a V-shaped recovery and shows that we have more than fully recovered what we had lost in price. Concession use, which has been a main topic of discussion for the last 18 months is now being used on a very limited basis and in line with pre-pandemic levels, with less than 1% of our applications in September and October receiving an average concession amount of less than 2 weeks. New lease change was up 10.1% in the third quarter and is on track to be just over 11% in October. We have seen signs of seasonal softening, both in terms of pricing power and application volume but these trends are normal to slightly better than typical seasonality patterns. And more importantly, the volume of traffic and applications currently is more than sufficient given the low levels of available inventory we have in the portfolio. Renewals were a major focus for the quarter given the rapid improvement in market pricing from a year ago as well as the fact that we have slightly more expirations in the back half of 2021 than normal. We have been centralizing negotiations for the San Francisco, New York and Boston markets and our offsite call center group as pricing in these markets were the most impacted by the pandemic and conversations in these markets have become more and more difficult as we are dealing with residents who receive large concessions and much lower rates this time last year. The good news is that the results have been great across all of our markets. We renewed 62% of residents in September and October is on track to be just below 65% which is much better than the 55% historical norm that we thought we were going to stabilize at. At the same time, renewal rate achieved has continued to improve with September at 7.7% and October on track to be 9%. We expect continued growth despite what will likely be challenging negotiations. Perhaps our biggest positive from these negotiations is that so far, we are not seeing any material difference in renewal behaviors from the deal seekers who received very discounted rents last year versus our more tenured residents. Overall, they are renewing at similar paces. This is something we will continue watching very closely. Before providing color on a couple of markets, let me touch on our positioning for 2022. As we think about same-store revenue growth, we have some key drivers that should work in our favor. First, our existing leases are at a material loss to lease. What I mean by that is if we snapshot all of our leases in place today and compare them to current market prices, 86% of our residents are paying on average rent that are significantly below current market prices. The result of this is a net effective loss to lease of 13.6%. This provides us with a significant opportunity to increase our revenue as we move these leases to market rates. That of course does not mean that we will capture the full 13% in 2022 largely because leases expire throughout the year not on January 1. And we currently are subject to renewal restrictions in some jurisdictions which means the change is very dependent upon who actually moves out. Regardless, this is definitely the highest loss to lease we have ever seen with such a large majority of leases below market, and the teams are hyper-focused to recapture as much of the loss to lease as possible. Second, we expect that the significant demand and favorable fundamentals in our business will drive additional revenue growth opportunities in all of our markets in 2022. Remember, we have seen unprecedented demand even with only modest return to office activity. So the backdrop for intra-period rent growth expectations in 2022 is strong. Third, we expect to get a nice lift from occupancy in the first half of the year as we were at 95% in the first quarter and 96.2% in the second quarter of this year. We are currently running above 96.5% and would expect to maintain this level or better in 2022. And finally, we have regulatory restrictions that are beginning to expire. This presents an opportunity to recapture revenue through the reduction of bad debt and increased collection of late fees in 2022. All of these factors combined put us in a position to deliver very strong revenue growth next year, assuming regulatory conditions continue to improve and the general economic conditions remain supportive. Moving to a couple of quick market comments. Starting on the East Coast, the New York market not only has fully rebounded, but it continues to have strong demand for our product despite the broader delays in return to office. At this point, New York is positioned to outperform seasonal trends in the fourth quarter. Boston and D.C. are performing as expected, with great demand and strong occupancy with normal seasonality. On the West Coast, Southern California has been and continues to be very strong. San Francisco and Seattle appear to be the 2 markets most impacted by the delay in return to office in terms of overall demand levels but so far appear to be following normal seasonality trends. San Francisco, while demonstrating a good recovery remains the only market that has not yet fully recovered from a pricing standpoint. Occupancy has been improving in San Francisco over the past month or so. And today, we are 96.5% and should be well positioned to capture demand and pricing power once the tech companies begin to provide more clarity around return-to-office plans. Seattle has been a little more volatile than expected. Current occupancy is 95.6%. And while the overall demand level is holding up, the announcement from Amazon a few weeks ago regarding office return decisions has impacted our leasing velocity. Our on-site teams in Seattle mentioned that prospects definitely have a lack of urgency to lease, but are very interested in options for later this year or early next year. Moving on to expenses. Mark mentioned our same-store expense guidance at 3.25% for the full year. We are seeing increased costs across all utility categories. However, about 65% of these costs are ultimately passed back to residents through the utility reimbursements that run through the revenue line. We are also seeing pressure on wages in this very tight labor market but have been successful in mitigating growth in our on-site payroll numbers by realizing staffing efficiencies. These efficiencies have been achieved through the numerous innovation initiatives that we have rolled out over the past year or so. This includes moving to self-guided tours, online leasing and utilizing our artificial intelligent leasing agent named Ella. On the service side, we also leverage our service mobility platform and new technology to deliver the experience and service that our customers require which is evident by the all-time high online reputation Google rating of 4.2 all while also reducing the expense pressures. We expect these efficiencies and opportunities to accelerate into 2022 as we continue to harness technology to deliver the customer experience that our residents require. Finally, I will end on an update on the rent relief recoveries. Fortunately, our affluent resident was less impacted by the pandemic as they kept their jobs and continue to pay rent. For those that were impacted we have continued to work with them, including assisting them and applying for rent relief. We have received $18.3 million September year-to-date in this rent relief with the majority of that coming to us in the third quarter. This exceeds our prior expectations of $15 million recovered in the full year. Even with some of the eviction moratoriums expiring our goal will be to continue working with residents to gain access to the additional rent relief funds. We continue to have good traction in this process and now expect the full year rental relief recoveries of between $25 million and $30 million in 2021. Let me close by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Sure. So this is Michael. And I'll tell you that for November, our net effective quotes were coming in or going out at 12.8%. And the December quotes are 13.2% on a net effective basis. And you could see that number is going to continue to grow, and it's going to widen because concession use was really ramping up this time last year. So you're coming up against more and more of those residents that had concessions. About 25% of all the offers that went out for November and December went to residents that had concessions. And I think, as I said in my prepared remarks so far the deal-seeking residents that we took in last year, they've been renewing at the same pace as compared to those that didn't have concessions. So we're really excited about kind of working our way through the renewal performance for the balance of the year. Chandni, this is Michael. Let me just start. I'll give a little bit of kind of the takeaway from 2021, a little bit about what we're seeing from an operations impact in '22. And then I'll let anybody else kind of pick up on some of the newer markets that we just entered. So I think I would start by saying that the tagline for 2021 on supply would be that strong demand greatly aided the absorption of new supply in our markets. D.C. produced record levels of Class A absorption and the South Bay, which we talked about on previous calls in San Francisco. That submarket at 4,000 new units being delivered. It continues on its path of recovery with strong occupancy and very limited concessions like in the stabilized portfolio. And I think we've talked about this before that we are really focused when we think about supply, and the concentration of the supply and the proximity of that new supply relative to our stable assets on top of when are the first units going to actually begin leasing. So for 2021, the overall supply numbers were elevated in our markets. But we said earlier on the call that the overall level of competitiveness against our portfolio was expected to be less. When we look forward, the data for the expected starts in 2022. So relative to this proximity of within 1 and 2 miles of our locations is less, which is a great indicator that we should continue to feel less pressure in the next year or so from the new supply being delivered right on top of us. Hey Brad, this is Michael. So I think you have a little bit of everything going on. I think right now, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're pretty well positioned in San Francisco. There is demand coming back to our product. It's just the pricing power wasn't quite where it needed to be to kind of recapture everything that was lost through the pandemic. So I think right now, when you look at the portfolio and you look at how it's positioned. As there's some, I guess, additional clarity around what return to office looks like, the tech companies have been all over the place in that market. So just a little bit more clarity, probably bring some incremental demand. And that most likely will happen after we get into the New Year. And the portfolio that we own right now is very well positioned to capture that demand and recapture some of that rate. When you look at it from a submarket basis, I said a little bit on the deliveries in the South Bay. We thought we were going to have pressure in the South Bay because of the new supply being delivered. We're really holding up really well there. Now the rate hasn't fully recovered, but the rate recovery in the South Bay is better than the rate recovery in Downtown San Francisco. So I think we need a few more months to just see how some of this ambiguity kind of flushes out, and then we'll have a better feel as to what that means for next year. Hi, Amanda. This is Michael. So maybe rather than going by every market, I'll just start by saying that the majority of our markets, so Boston, D.C., Seattle, Southern California and Denver, all fall within a range of a net effective loss to lease between 11% and 15% with about 80% plus of the residents in those markets being below market prices. Not surprising, San Francisco has the lowest with a 5.7% net effective loss to lease with 67% of residents paying below current market prices and New York is the highest with 21% loss to lease with 93% of the residents paying below the current market. And as I stated in my prepared remarks the loss to lease is a snapshot of today. And it never has translated into full year revenue growth because you have to work your way through those expirations. And I guess I'll just stop and just say that all of that being said, this is the best position the portfolio has ever been in for the ability to capture it. But I think you need several months into next year to really understand how you're going to translate that into revenue growth and how much of that is going to roll into 2023. And in regards to kind of thinking about the restrictions or the governors. I guess I would say it's really hard to understand because it's so subject to who is actually going to renew, who's going to move out and what your abilities are and what the caps are in place. And there really are so many different programs out there. So it's really difficult to try to quantify that for you. This is Michael. So I would tell you, our expectations are the continued success that we've seen in retention will balance out the rest of the year and probably even next year. We're in the mid-60s right now for October even the trends for November are very promising. The increases are getting more significant. We're having more conversations around negotiations, but just feel really positive about the ability to deliver results from that process."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Marty, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I'll give some brief remarks on a terrific pace of our operating recovery and our robust investment activity then Michael Manelis will follow with some top-level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see next year playing out, and then we'll take your questions. We have talked about 2021 being a year of recovery for our company. And we are very pleased to report that our operating metrics continue to recover at a faster rate than we assumed back in July with quarter-over-quarter same-store revenues turning positive for the first time since the pandemic began. Strong demand across our markets drove us to achieve physical occupancy of 96.6% in the third quarter, which allowed us to continue to push rental rates. We also benefited from governmental rental relief payments made on behalf of our tenants. As a result of these strong continued operating metrics, we have raised our annual same-store revenue, net operating income and normalized FFO guidance again this quarter. We now expect our same-store revenues to decline 3.7%, our expenses to increase 3.25% and NOI to decline 7% for the full year of 2021. We expect to produce normalized FFO per share of between $2.95 and $2.97, a 2% increase at the midpoint. All of this leaves us very well positioned going into 2022. While we won't provide guidance for next year until our next earnings release in February, in our management presentation you can find the building blocks that point to our business being set up for an extended period of higher-than-trend growth beginning in 2022 as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes resulting from a very strong job market. We expect same-store revenue growth in 2022 to exceed the historical mid-single-digit range that has characterized past recoveries, leading to some of the best same-store revenue numbers we have ever seen. These expectations assume that the economic backdrop remains constructive and the pandemic remains controlled. Please also note that while we expect to do very well next year, we will not be able to make up our entire mark-to-market on our rent roll and regain our entire loss to lease in a single year for a variety of marketing and regulatory reasons that Michael will describe in a moment. Beyond 2022, we see a continuing bright future for our business as the large emerging Gen Z cohort starts their careers and joins the renter population. Also, the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward. Switching to the transaction side of the business. The positive story on fundamentals has not gone unnoticed by the investment community as the overall theme continues to be enormous amounts of capital pursuing all types of apartment investment, driving cap rates to new lows. This has caused the convergence in nominal cap rates in the 3.5% or so range for many markets and has created a positive climate for our strategic repositioning efforts. We continue to aggressively sell our older and less desirable properties at these low cap rates and at prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates, acquiring much newer assets in our expansion markets of Dallas Fort Worth, Austin, Atlanta and Denver and the select suburbs of our established markets at approximately equal cap rates. All of the assets we are acquiring share the common characteristic of being recently built, having no or minimal retail and being attractive to our target affluent renter demographic. We like that these trades are not dilutive to current earnings while adding properties to the portfolio that we believe will have better long-term cash flow growth, lower capital needs and diversification benefits. Year-to-date, we have purchased more than $1 billion of properties and expect to close another $400 million or so in acquisitions mostly in our expansion markets, a good number of which are in various stages of advanced negotiation already, all by year-end. We have funded these buys with an approximately equal amount of dispositions of older and less desirable assets, which we sold at an average premium of 10% to our pre-pandemic estimates of value. Included in these sales are approximately $900 million of California assets. Currently, approximately 42% of our total assets are in California. As we seek to have more balance in our portfolio, you should expect our California exposure to decline over time, but to remain meaningful. Turning to development. We had a lot of great news in the quarter. It all starts with the apartment development joint venture with Toll Brothers, the public homebuilder that we announced in August. We have known and respected the team at Toll for many years and have successfully partnered with them before. They built terrific properties and have a large team spread across our expansion markets and select of our other markets that we expect to leverage in this joint venture to create quality properties for equity residential to own long term. The venture is off to a quick start as we closed already in this fourth quarter on 1 Toll land opportunity and are working with them on many others. We also have a strong internal development team in our company that continues to create opportunities. In this quarter, that team completed the development of our Edge property in Bethesda, Maryland. This high-end asset is adjacent to an existing EQR asset and located very near a metro station as well as the large amount of new office space that has recently been built in downtown Bethesda. They also sourced and structured the 3 new joint venture development deals in Washington, D.C., Denver and suburban New York that began construction this quarter. Each of these joint venture development deals is with a different partner and is not related to the Toll venture. Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You're doing an exceptional job during what was a particularly busy leasing season, and we are all very proud and grateful. Go ahead, Michael. Nick, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. We're not giving '22 guidance, but as you said we did try to lay out how we're thinking about things what the building blocks are, what the team is trying to figure out as we look towards '22. When we made the comment both in the release and in my prepared remarks that it's setting up to be the best year in the company's history. For same-store revenue growth, I do want to give a little context. So a normal and I'll say a normal meaning the last couple of recessions for us have consisted of 2 years or so of negative same-store revenue growth, and we've certainly had that this time. A year or so where same-store revenue growth was right around zero slightly positive, slightly negative, kind of a transition year. And in a couple of years where we compounded 5%, mid-5% same-store revenue growth numbers for high-4s, those kinds of things. Given the earn-in given this loss to lease that we see, we think we're going to skip that transition year and that's a comment I made on the last call as well. We're going to skip right over that zero and head right into a year that's likely to be a fair bit higher than the 5.5% or so number you would think of as a normal second year recovery. The recovery is V-shaped, just like the decline was V-shaped. And so I think what you see here is the confidence the team has given the demand and the occupancy numbers. That's subject to some regulatory flak here and there. We're going to regain a great deal of that loss to lease, but certainly not all of it. And I think a bit of it is going to end up in 2023. And there's just customer relations issues. There's regulatory issues with some of these increases in the size of them. And Michael has done a great job with the team of retaining our residents giving them great service. So hopefully that helps. In terms of locked in, I can't give you a locked-in number. The team is going to need to work the whole year to do that. But it feels like that 5.5% is a bit of a floor in terms of next year's same-store revenue number. Great question. It's Mark again. In terms of the compounding the compounding is going to start with the operations with the NOI from the same-store portfolio. Look at '22 when we've given you some color. And certainly it's hard to look much further in our business. But we do look at '23 and see less supply. There were a lot of deals that were delayed the starts due to the pandemic. And while supply is likely to pick up in '24 our look at proximity of supply and other things makes us feel like we got at least a couple of years here, pretty good numbers coming at us on the same-store NOI. And that will always be the big engine at EQR. Development to us is just a great complement to our efforts to acquire assets especially in these newer markets, these suburban markets. And we feel like right now, our shareholders are getting paid to take that risk with our ability to underwrite development yields at around 5 on current rents. And all of these acquisitions we're looking at being in the mid-3s. We're trying to be very thoughtful. This is an inflationary climate, and construction costs are far from immune to that. But I think you're going to see growth both from the same-store portfolio and from actual net growth of the company through development that we're likely to fund with a combination of incremental debt, net cash flow, which we'll have more of starting next year and occasional asset sale and a little bit of equity like we did this quarter. Hey, Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start. And then I'm going to give it over to Alec. So in terms of how big it can get it will take a little while to ramp up. Our expectation is this could get to $1 billion to $1.2 billion a year of starts in a year or so and maybe $700 million of that is Toll and the rest of it is other JVs and the stuff that we create internally. I think that, that will be funded in a way that will make that a pretty accretive thing. But most importantly for us, it's creating and giving us product again in markets and submarkets we just don't have enough exposure. So I think Alec can speak a little bit to things the internal team is doing because they're very active. They're doing a lot of good stuff. We got some great densification deals we haven't talked a lot about. So I'm going to let him speak to that. And hopefully, that gives you the color you need. I guess, 17 years of experience doing this job and the CFO job. I mean a lot - this is a pretty variable world. A lot's going on. Certainly, the actions of the Fed on the taper are super relevant to how the economy recovers. So I would say there's just enough variability here. We told you sort of what we know, Jeff, which is this sort of earn-in, this loss to lease. We gave you I think some pretty specific parameters on where things like bad debt might be able to go. And then the big mysteries really are regulatory pressures, how the intra-period growth feels next year. And then where we end this year? I mean we're going to spend the next 2 months continuing hopefully to close some of that loss to lease by writing terrific new leases with happy customers and locking in revenues for next year. So there's just enough variables where any guidance I'd give you would be too wide to be meaningful on same-store revenue. And I think the conversation in February will be much higher quality. All right. It's Mark. Thanks for that, Jeff. So what we see is a pretty significant decline in '23 a lot - and this is again in deliveries, just to be clear. And that's really as a result of delays in starts or delays in completions of product that was underway during the pandemic. And so we're going to get a break - more of a break in New York, for example, but even that is a little bit by area. There'll be a fair bit delivered in Brooklyn. There'll be a fair bit delivered in the Jersey Coast, but in Manhattan, almost nothing. D.C. will kind of continue doing what D.C. does and deliver a lot. But we're going to feel a lot better about places like San Francisco and Los Angeles and Seattle. So we feel like we're walking into a pretty good setup. When you start thinking about what might deliver in '24, and those are things that are starting now, there is a lot of development activity. The space is in great demand. The investment community hasn't not seen the strong recovery and the stability of the sector. And so we think there'll be a good amount of demand - or excuse me a good amount of supply, but probably more spread out. The market that's most on the watch list of our new markets for supply is certainly Austin. Austin has a lot. We're being very thoughtful about adding exposure there. You may see us slow that down and add it a little bit later. There's just going to be 30,000 units for some number of years there. Atlanta feels pretty good to us on supply. Dallas has supply, but it's spread out and it's a big demand market. So I guess that's the color we'd give you. Denver has a lot of supply too more downtown than otherwise. But again, we have a portfolio we're building that in Denver will be a pretty diversified portfolio when we're done. So Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start and maybe others will contribute. So the rushing back to the office thing. I'd point out, a lot of people are coming back because the city is reopened. They're not sure when they're employers coming back to full time. But they want to be back because they love the lifestyle in West L.A. and they love living in Downtown Seattle. And they want to go back to their favorite coffee shops. And you and I have had this discussion before. I think it's a little bit about return to office, but it's also about just energized cities attracting our kind of residents. In terms of the shape of the curve, I don't think you're wrong about that. I think the numbers early have to be extraordinary because the comp period is so poor in '21 that that's exactly what will probably occur. But what else will be going in the other direction is the normalized FFO by quarter number. Because as Michael's team writes better and better leases, as Bob does this accounting work and roll those numbers up, you're likely to see the earnings power of the firm in the middle part of the year revert back to what it was in 2019. So again, the quarter-over-quarter numbers are going to be exceptional early and they're going to be merely very strong late in the year. But I think what you're going to see besides those operating statistics, Rich, is that quarterly normalized FFO number get better I think, every quarter of next year. Alex, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. So we thought it was prudent to dust off the old ATM as you put it and put it to some use here. And it's really about this increase in development spending. So our typical development spending needs the last 3-4 years have been $300 million to $500 million. And here, I'm talking about spending, not start. So of course, they correspond. And we were funding that out of free cash flow and a little incremental debt that didn't change our ratios because you had the new development assets on your books creating income after they were stabilized. Going forward with the idea that we're likely to start $1 billion or $1.2 billion a year after a ramp-up period, you need to be very thoughtful about how you match fund that. And when you look at 2023 we have a pretty significant amount of debt maturities in that year as well. And that's probably the first year we're going to reach this run rate of starts. And so it seemed prudent to us after consulting with the Board to take a little equity into the mix. I think you're right that it will predominantly be funded with free cash flow. And we expect to have that again next year. And hopefully in some good abundance, incremental debt, occasional asset sales as long as we can stay within our taxable income kind of caps. And then we will. I think we will be issuing a smattering of equity here and there given the size of the development expectations for the company in the next few years. I guess I don't view it as a shift. It's the same group of people, maybe in different chairs, but it's the same conversations. I mean we don't want to dilute our current investors. That's an important priority. But we do think that when you're creating new assets having a little equity foundationally makes sense. We know what the cash needs are to fund the development pipeline. So the conversation with the board was very easy on this point. They felt that if you were $300 million, $400 million, $500 million a year spender of development, that was 1 thing. If you're going to double it that was a whole another thing. And so that was the real thing that changed, Alex, it's just this magnitude of what the management team is suggesting development can be. Yeah. A lot of parts to that question. So I'll try - I'm going to start though with the policy part. That good cause eviction is just rent control by another name. It's bad policy. New York said rent control, you know you live there for - since World War 2 and the housing situation in New York has not improved. This is just going to cause less housing to be built and more disinvestment in existing housing. And there's a lot of better ideas like SP9 in California and 40 B in Massachusetts and some of these zoning reforms in Minneapolis that should have been thought about. So we're disappointed if it indeed is the direction it's going. And we'll work through our association to suggest other better alternatives. But let's assume it does go. It was our intention to lighten the load in New York. I think New York is going to have extraordinary revenue growth next year as a result of just going back to where it was in '19, frankly. And so the idea of putting good cause eviction in where it's going to affect landlords who have been beaten up by the pandemic have property taxes to pay and all the rest seems like particularly bad timing and is going to particularly discourage production. It doesn't make us want to own more in New York City. That's for sure and in New York State. So I guess I'd say it's a negative to investment in the city and in the state. In terms of lower property taxes, I love that idea. They did come with lower taxes than we expected for the most part this year in general. We'll see. I don't know many municipalities that like to keep their property taxes low if they can raise them. So I'm guessing they won't lower them for us enough, Alex to kind of reimburse for what's about to happen if good cause comes through. But again, it's just a bad policy idea, putting aside the impact on EQR and we can respond to it. We'll lighten the load New York, and that's unfortunate. And a lot of other people will do the same thing and there'll be less capital for housing in New York. Hey, Amanda. It's Mark. I'm going to start and Alec may have something. But we're underwriting these deals and generally for Toll to bring them to us is we said they need to be in that 5% yield range on current rents or better. And so right now, Alec and his team are buying at a 3.5% or so cap rate on existing assets. So that's at 3.5% to 5% difference, that 150 basis points or so of margin that again, we think is compensating us for the risk. So when we buy the asset, we will be paying Toll of promote presumably. And so we'll be buying it at a slightly lower cap rate than that 5% in my example, assuming no intra-period rent growth. But again, because of the way the promote is structured and all of that it's not that meaningful a difference. I mean we're 75% of the capital in the deal or the equity capital in the deal. So is that helpful to you? Thank you. Alec give you detail in a second because I have been a little shift here and there. But it's interest rates matter, but fund flows matter more. And fund flows right now are highly favorable into the space because of the performance matters you mentioned. Though there were significant declines in urban apartments, they came back pretty quick. And because the GSEs existing as a financing option that no other sector has. So I think when we look back at our research, there was generally a 200 basis point difference between whatever cap rate we thought we were underwriting on acquisition whatever the 10-year spot treasury rate was. Right now the 10-year spot treasury rate is 1.5%, a lot of what Alec buying is very much close to that 3.7. So it might be a little lower, but it's not a lot lower. So I don't feel like we're that far out of whack. And I do feel like, generally speaking when we look at the whole sort of situation it generally seems to make sense to me. And I don't think that interest rates rising alone as long as cash flows increase will drive values down. But Alec, I don't know if you want to talk about the bidding cash you're seeing? And so it's Mark. Just to clarify that, Rob. You mean that in California because of some of these Prop 13 limits, property taxes can't grow as much going forward. I mean in our - as maybe in Atlanta, they wouldn't be bounded by that. Well, I guess I'd say a couple of things. First, for example, in Texas, there's a whole bunch of property tax limitations that are coming into place on both commercial real estate, residential real estate. Alec and his team underwrite these increases. So if cash flow isn't going up net-net, then those assets aren't going to be appealing to us. So I'm not sure what you said is certain because when you say same-store expenses, maybe property taxes go up more. But I'll tell you, California minimum wage is a lot higher. California, all the other compliance costs that go with owning in California are much higher. So I think if you're talking about holistic same-store expenses, I'm not sure I believe, at least for the first 10 years or so of owning a California asset that there's going to be that much of a difference in same-store expense growth. But Alec, do you have a - It's Mark. I'm going to start and if Bob or Michael have anything they'll add. But I'm on Page 12 of our press release, we give you a bunch of disclosure about residential bad debt and maybe this will bound this up for you. In 2019, our write-offs, so that would be a direct negative against residential revenues were about 40 basis points. That's a good run rate of delinquency in our portfolio rents we never receive and that burden same-store revenue. When you look at what happened last year in '20, where there were no recoveries and the pandemic was 3 quarters of the year and this year, you see on the bottom of 12, we're talking about numbers that are in the 2%, 2.5% range is a headwind. Now the problem we're having is forecasting for you, where between 40 basis points and 2.5% does next year fall. And that depends on how quickly the court's process evictions, our success in continuing to work with our residents, which is always our first goal whether government revenue - government rent relief programs kind of leak, Robert, into next year or mostly are covered this year. So that - hopefully, that gives you a boundary, but that's what we have to be a little general about because there just isn't certainty in our mind and across so many court systems and so many jurisdictions for us to know how all that stuff plays out. Very much so. And you can see what it did to our Q3 number went down to 70 basis points. So we can have a - but yeah, we told you that we continue to collect all but 2.5% or so of our rents. So when we're - that changed a little. It's getting a little better collections are every month from what is still a very good collection level already. But this government money is definitely hard to predict. And then when we can start working with people more directly and getting them into a housing situation that's stable for them long term, I don't know when that is exactly, but we think it's coming up. So the New York Eviction moratorium we understand expires in the middle of January '22, both commercial and residential. California's statewide eviction moratorium has expired, but there are some city of Los Angeles rules out there still. Boston instituted an eviction moratorium that has no set expiration date. They have an election in a week and then after that we'll see. Seattle has an expiry of their commercial and residential eviction moratorium in the middle of January of '22 as well. So you could see I'm giving you a hodgepodge of dates, there's local overlay. There's a lot going on here. So that's why you're getting a range from us and not the precision that we usually try and give you. Thanks, Rob. Well, I think that's the end of the call. We're appreciative for everyone's time and attention on the call today. Have a good day."

            "name": "Robert Garechana",
            "content": "I mean I'm not going to probably give specifics in terms of a range because we're not providing guidance yet. But maybe a little bit to think about the components that are running through and where they're positioned as we go into 2022 if that helps, John. So you think about the big 4 categories real estate taxes we've had a good amount of success. That's 40% of expenses. We've had a good amount of success so far on appeals. I think we're not seeing a ton of pressure from the municipalities. And I think that could carry over into another pretty good year into 2022. So pretty good year means in my mind kind of sub that 3-ish or 3.5% kind of regular run-rate inclusive of 421as and other things. On the payroll side, we've done an excellent job I think of managing what has been an inflationary kind of pressure over time. We're going on our third year of payroll that is sub 1% in terms of growth. So what Michael is doing sometimes quietly on the side in terms of managing innovation and doing new implementation is really offsetting what I think is something that every company is experiencing, which is payroll pressure. And we've been really good at it thus far. And I don't think there's anything that's likely to change in a significant way. It means that we feel the pressure. We're just doing things in a different way and innovating in a way to really offset that pressure. The last 2 categories, which are R&M and utilities I think, are the ones that we're most focused on outside of like the payroll side. A big chunk of them can be passed back to the residents, but we're certainly all seeing commodity pressures. You saw what that gap has done kind of recently. And that's the one that I think is where you see higher single digits. But put it all into the blender, I don't think that 2022 is that outsized relative to what we've seen historically in this business over time. Hey, Rich, it's Bob. That's probably a little bit on the high end of the range. But yeah, I think you're in the ballpark. So we think, as Michael said, for the full year, we'll be at $25 million to $30 million. And we're already at $18 million so far through 9/30. So I think that it probably will benefit from some of the rental assistance and '22 will likely be kind of a transition year. But it also is going to experience this elevated write-off too. Because you still have that is unlike like '19, similar to what we've seen in '21 and '20, right? There's 2 things that will drive bad debt. One is the rental assistance payments; and two is just the ability to start collecting on the units that haven't been collected. And that's a small number for us. It's been a small number given the high-quality renter base that we have. But those are the 2 driving factors that I think are going to make 2022 as kind of bad debt number between what you would have seen in '19 and what we saw in maybe 2021. I think that we'll have a better idea as we get to kind of providing guidance in general. But just to be clear, I don't think it's a headwind. I think it's a benefit to revenue. I think we kind of alluded to that. I think we should be in a better position in '22 than we were in '21. I think it's - it's Bob, Brad. I think it starts with just getting to the point where these residents that haven't been able to pay start making different housing choices or are in a position to start paying. And so that can come in a few forms. It can come in the form of some of the eviction restrictions being lifted. It can come in the form of residents now being employed again because the economy is in a much better spot and they can start paying again. But there's a process that we're all going to have to go through of kind of unwinding this or moving back to kind of a market level, and that's going to take a little bit of time. That's unlikely to be a light switch like activity, especially as we work with residents' kind of figuring that out. And so as a result, I think '22 is going to be that transition year I alluded to. That's probably the biggest thing. And then to add a little bit - to the financial statements, to add a little bit more noise associated with it or make the forecasting harder as I like to say around here. You're going to have the trickle down of the government rental assistance payments because those programs eventually will come to an end as well. So it's really the unwind part of that, that's likely to occur in 2022."

            "name": "Alexander Brackenridge",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Rich, this is Alex. Yeah, so we look at a lot of deals. We are a selective developer. And whether it's through the Toll JV, which has been off to a great start. They have a great pipeline and we're actively engaged with them on each project and assessing whether it fits for us. And then as Mark mentioned, we have these densifications throughout our portfolio, largely in California but in other markets as well. And we have a great internal expertise on how to assess and execute on. So we're excited about that. And then as we've mentioned in the release, we're continually looking at other joint venture opportunities outside of Toll. So we have a broad range of projects that we look at and are very selective on the ones we pick. So it's a range, depending a lot on the project. And this concept of replacement cost is an important metric. It's something we look at but it's not an absolute thing. It's actually a little bit more challenging to calculate than you might think because you don't always find an apples-to-apples and may be a location that's really almost impossible to find similar product to build - some of the location to build the same kind of product. Parking is another variable. Surface parked, you may have an existing project that has surface parked, but the municipality won't allow you to do that or the project sites too dense. So that maybe you go to a structured parking, which is more expensive where you go underground which is yet more expensive. On top of which there are code changes that can generally make things more expensive and inclusionary housing requirements. So we look at it as a metric we look at, but we assess all of those things on a project-by-project basis and determine whether or not we think it fits based on that and the typical yield parameters that we assess. There's no absolute number. So we have - and Chandni, this is Alec. We have specific markets that we've designated through the Toll program that we're going to focus on. And for example, Atlanta is a market that we're very focused on with them. Dallas is another one. There are other markets where they don't have a presence or they're not part of the venture. And so those are areas where we'd be more likely to invest on our own or with another joint venture partner. Hey Rich, this is Alec. And I think San Francisco is an example where people aren't back in the office, but they still want to be in the cities. To your first part of your question, I think the hybrid model does work well. Because it enables you to do both, enjoy the city and also be close enough to work to get in when you have to go in. So we're seeing the impact of that. And we are working on making our amenities more suited to that. So we've increased a lot of our co-working space within our amenities. And we haven't said no to retail. We like ground floor retail. We like activated streets. We just would like to have a relatively small amount of it compared to the apartment business that we love. So John, this is Alec. There are in some cases, slightly fewer bidders showing up at the auction. That's kind of the feedback we get from brokers. But I'll tell you, the pricing hasn't gone down. In fact, it's continued to edge up. So there are some participants who have kind of stepped back and said, Well, I'm not going to win anyway. So I'm not going to spend my time underwriting this, but there's still enough, as Mark says, funds flowing in to make it for a very competitive bid to be able to prevail. On our end, what we're trying and are doing is matching up the timing of our dispositions and our acquisitions. So we're effectively making a neutral bet. We're not going out on a limb. So that's protecting us. And in the sort of spirit of full disclosure on this. A lot of our buyers are leveraged buyers of our assets. So if the Fed raises floating rates, but if they stay still relatively low compared to the cap rates, these are good leverage buys. So that's one of the other thing that continues to force capital into our space. Well, the other thing I'd add, Rob, this is Alec is that we're buying properties at on average 2 years old and selling properties that are 30 years old. And that expense load on the older properties tends to accumulate over time. And so that there is a very significant trade-off there."

Now, at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Martin McKenna. Please go ahead.\nMartin McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s second quarter 2021 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release as well as a management presentation regarding our results and outlook are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Marty, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I will give some brief remarks on our operating trajectory and investment activity. Then Michael Manelis will follow with some top level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see the remainder of the year playing out, followed by Bob Garechana adding color on our guidance changes and balance sheet. And then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also, as Marty mentioned, we are pleased to have Alec Brackenridge, EQR\u2019s Chief Investment Officer available during the Q&A period. For those of you who do not know Alec, he\u2019s a 28-year veteran of this company. He literally started work here the day we went public in 1993 and took over as our CIO in 2020. As you can see from the release, he and his team have done exceptional work of late on the transaction side. Turning to operations. All of our operating metrics continue to improve at a faster rate than we assumed earlier in the year. We\u2019re seeing demand levels well above 2019 in all our markets. And this has allowed us to continue growing occupancy while at the same time raising rates. This resulted in the company materially raising annual same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO guidance. While our quarter-over-quarter same-store revenue and NOI results remained negative. The decline was less than what we expected and our sequential same-store revenue and NOI showed positive growth for the first time since the pandemic began. As we have discussed on prior calls improvement are reported quarter-over-quarter same-store numbers will lag the recovery in our operating fundamentals, as we work these now higher rents and lower concessions through our rent roll. We believe that our business is set up for an extended period of higher than trend growth beginning in 2022, as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes in our target demographic. Also the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward. On the investment side, we\u2019re active buyers and sellers in the second quarter and expect to continue being active capital recyclers. Consistent with what I\u2019ve said on prior calls, we are allocating capital to places that are attractive to our affluent renter base, including the suburbs of our established coastal markets, as well as Denver and our two new markets of Austin and Atlanta. We are making these trades with no dilution, even given higher pricing levels for the properties we are targeting, because we\u2019re able to sell our older and less desirable properties at low cap rates and at prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates. Earlier this month, we re-entered the Texas market after an 11-year absence by acquiring two well located new assets in Austin, Texas. These properties are located in a desirable area with high housing costs. That is equidistant between downtown Austin and the domain hub on the North side. We acquired these two properties for $96 million and approximately 3.9% cap rate and about $195,000 per unit. We expect to acquire a mix of urban and suburban assets in the Austin market. During the second quarter, and in July, we acquired two properties in Atlanta, Skyhouse South in Midtown for $115 million at a 3.6% cap rate. This is a deal we did previously disclose. And a few days ago, we acquired a second property in Atlanta and the Bustling Midtown west neighborhood. We acquired this new property for $135 million, and it is about half occupied. And once it completes lease-up, we expect it will stabilize at 4.1% cap rate. We also continued adding our Denver presence by purchasing an asset in the suburban Central Park area of Denver for $95 million. This property is located just west of the large and growing Fitzsimons medical campus and draws residents attracted to its access to abundant outdoor amenities. We expect this property, which is also in lease up currently to stabilize at a 4.2% cap rate. We\u2019re also pleased to add to the portfolio of property each in the suburbs of Boston and Washington, D.C. The Boston property is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, and is a new asset that we acquired for $134.5 million at a 4.1% cap rate. This property is in a difficult to build suburb of Boston with high single family housing costs and good access to high paying jobs. The DC asset is located in Fairfax, Virginia, and is a 2016 asset that we acquired for $70 million at a 4.3% cap rate. This property is well located with both good highway and good metro access and proximity to growing job base in Northern Virginia. Both the Burlington and Fairfax assets are located in sub markets or our existing assets have performed particularly well. Year-to-date, we have bought $645 million of properties and expect to close on another $850 million in acquisitions. A good number of which are in various states of advanced negotiation by the end of the year. We\u2019ll fund these buys with an approximately equivalent amount of dispositions, mostly from California of older and less desirable assets, which we sold or under contract to sell at significantly above our pre-pandemic estimate of value. Turning to development. We put into service and began leasing our newly developed property in Alameda Island, a short ferry ride to the city of San Francisco, built on the site of a former naval base. This property has terrific views of the skyline and an evolving restaurant and bar scene that we think is attractive to our clientele. Over the next few months, we will complete our other two current development projects, including the Alcott in Central Boston, the largest development project in the company\u2019s history, early leasing efforts on this project and our development project in Bethesda, Maryland are going well. And our current estimates are that these three projects will stabilize at a development yield of approximately 5%, considerably higher than prevailing acquisition cap rates. These properties will be meaningful contributors to NFFO starting in late 2022. We see development as a good compliment to our acquisition activities, as we spread more of our footprint to the suburbs of our established markets, as well as to our new markets. We expect a significant amount of our development activity going forward to be done through joint venture arrangements. This allows us to leverage our partners in place sourcing and entitlement teams in locations like our new markets, where we do not currently have a development presence. Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You are doing an exceptional job during this particularly busy leasing season. And we\u2019re all very proud and grateful. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark. As evidenced by our revised guidance, the pace of recovery has been very strong. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overall trends. So first, we continue to see very good demand for our apartment homes. Our national call center and Ella, our AI leasing agent are responding to record high levels of inbound interest for our apartments, which is converting into high volumes of self guided tours. This overall level of demand continues to drive applications and moving activity that is exceeding move out and ultimately is delivering stronger than expected recovery and occupancy. Portfolio wide, physical occupancy is currently 96.5%, which is back to 2019 levels. San Francisco and Seattle are still trending slightly below 2019 and Southern California markets are slightly above. At this point, we expect to run the portfolio above 96% through the remainder of the third quarter. This strength and occupancy is allowing us to push rate and drive revenue growth. Overall, we are more than halfway through the typical peak leasing season and the momentum has been very strong providing us the opportunity to raise rates, reduce concessions, and grow occupancy. These fundamentals are delivering RV recovery from March to December of 2020 pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions declined approximately $500 per unit. From January 2021 to today, pricing trend has grown $660 and is now not only above prior year levels in all markets, but every market except for San Francisco is also above 2019 peak pricing trend levels. Today, the portfolio is approximately $100 higher per unit than our peak 2019 levels. Our priority has been to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. At the end of the first quarter, about 20% of applications were receiving on average four weeks in concessions. As of July, we are now running with less than 3% of our applications receiving on average just over two weeks. And we expect this to continue to drop off even further. To give you perspective, the total dollar of concessions granted peaked in the month of February at just north of $6 million for the same-store portfolio. For July, we will be at $1.5 million for the month and August should be less than $750,000. Last week, only 12 properties had any concessions being offered. The percent of residents renewing has stabilized around 55%, which is very much in line with historical averages, but below the record high 60% levels that we had in 2019 and early 2020. As you saw in the press release achieved renewal increase, new lease change and blended rate all continued to improve in July and we expect further improvements through the balance of the year as the comp period becomes more favorable and the business continues to strengthen. As we progress through the remainder of the year, our focus will continue to be to push rates in our markets and manage our renewal negotiations. In our management presentation, we provided color on all of our markets, but I wanted to take a minute to highlight New York and San Francisco, as they tend to be the markets we received the most questions about. Both markets are recovering nicely with concession use nearly non-existent in our New York portfolio and declining rapidly in San Francisco. New York is seeing stronger demand right now, and we think it is primarily due to greater clarity around employer returned to office plans. New York employers, particularly the banks and financial firms have called their employees back to the office and you could feel it in the economic activity in many areas of Manhattan. We see it in our portfolio after nine consecutive weeks of record application volume. In San Francisco, however, the return to office and reopening is a little more ambiguous. Employers have been slower to call employees back in with many initially targeting after Labor Day. Adding to the uncertainty in San Francisco is the reintroduction of strong recommendations for indoor masking and some delays in reopening, which were announced last week. The situation in San Francisco is likely to lead to a delayed leasing season in that market and a slower full recovery of occupancy. That said, occupancy is 95.4% today in San Francisco and is growing as is pricing trends. At this pace, we expect the San Francisco pricing trend to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, we are seeing some indicators that we could see an extended leasing season with a second wave of demand in New York, Boston and Seattle. Our leasing teams in these markets have been dealing with prospects that are looking for moving dates in late August and September and hearing from them that these moves are in connection with their need to be back in the office or in the case of Boston back on campus. This demand is more robust than historical patterns, which could suggest an extended peak leasing season in those markets and matches up nicely with our lease expirations, which are more weighted towards the back of the year than usual. Combining all of the data points I\u2019ve just shared and those included in the management presentation, we see an unprecedented opportunity to grow sequential revenue over the next several quarters as the impact of better rates, nearly non-existing concessions and higher occupancy compound. We acknowledge how badly our operations declined over the last 16 months, but the current recovery appears to be strong enough to both quickly recapture all that was lost in the pandemic and take us into a new period of strong operating fundamentals. Finally, I want to take a minute and give you an update on the government assistance program for renters. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, approximately $50 billion in rental assistance for those impacted financially by the pandemic was made available in the various relief bills. We are laser focused on accessing the rental relief funds and are working very closely with our eligible residents to apply for this relief. Processing to-date has been relatively slow in our markets, but we were able to recover approximately $5 million in the quarter. Bob will provide some color on our expectations for collections for the remainder of 2021 in his remarks. Let me close by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. This pace of recovery would not be possible without them and they remain relentless and taking care of each other and serving our customers. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Garechana: Thanks, Michael. This morning, I\u2019ll cover the changes in 2021 guidance that were included in last night\u2019s release along with a couple of quick comments on the balance sheet in capital markets. As Michael just discussed, the recovery is well underway and is exceeding our prior expectations for the same store portfolio. The continued strong operating momentum from this leasing season has led us to raise our annual same-store revenue guidance from negative 6% to negative 8% to negative 4% to negative 5%, and improvement at the midpoint of 250 basis points. Strong expense controls and favorable real estate tax outcomes, which I will talk about in a moment also allowed us to reduced our same-store expense guidance range to an increase of 2.75% to 3.25%, resulting in an NOI range of negative 7.5% to negative 8.5%, which is a 400 basis point improvement at the midpoint relative to our prior guidance. Drivers of our revenue guidance increase of 250 basis points are roughly 150 basis points of improving operating fundamentals that Michael just outlined, 60 basis points or $15 million for the full year and related lower bad debt, primarily due to anticipated rental assistance collections and the remaining 40 basis points is due to improved performance in our non-residential business. Before I move on to expenses, a quick comment on our bad debt assumptions. The back half of the year has about $10 million of additional assumed rental assistance collections, on top of the $5 million we\u2019ve already received. We feel very confident about this amount, because we either received it in July or after some real digging can see that it is far along in the approval process. There are other resident accounts being worked on, but they\u2019re not as far along, given the lack of transparency and the relative slow processing speed to date, it is difficult to handicap how much will successfully get processed and whether we will receive these funds in 2021 or it\u2019ll spill over into 2022. On the expense side, we have also seen improvements versus prior expectations, which led us to center the midpoint of expense guidance at 3%, which was the low end of our prior guidance range. This reduction is in part due to the modest growth experience in Q2 2021, even with a really challenging comparable period from Q2 of 2020. While some expense categories experienced atypically high percentage growth change quarter-over-quarter due to this compatibility issue, overall expenses were less than originally anticipated. Key categories driving the current period and anticipated full year lower were real estate taxes and payroll. Reduction in growth expectations for real estate taxes is primarily driven by lower than forecasted assessed values in some key markets. Lower payroll growth expectations are primarily driven by our progress and optimizing staffing utilization as well as higher than usual staffing vacancies. We expect that 2021 will be our third consecutive year of low payroll growth, having delivered a three-year average below 1%, while keeping other controllable expenses like repairs and maintenance in check. As a result of these same-store guidance changes, we raise the midpoint of our normalized FFO from $2.75 to $2.90. A couple closing comments on the balance sheet in debt capital markets. With the impact of the pandemic on our operations increasingly in the rear view mirror, it is clear that our balance sheet has held up remarkably well. Despite, unprecedented pressure on operations, our credit metrics have remained well within our stated net debt to EBITDA leverage policy of between 5.5 times to 6.5 times. The debt capital markets are also incredibly attractive at the moment for issuers like us. This creates opportunities to term out commercial paper with treasuries and credit spreads at or near record lows. The potential of which has been incorporated into our revised guidance range. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe we start on the rental assistance. Bob, appreciate all the comments in terms of what was recovered in the second quarter and what\u2019s assumed and understand the kind of desire to be conservative. But can you frame kind of the total opportunity of collecting any of the back rent through these programs?\nBob Garechana: Yes. Thanks, Nick. So if you look at our disclosure in terms of our total receivables, the gross amount of receivables on the books in the same-store portfolio is about $44 million, right. So that\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s almost entirely reserved again. So that\u2019s really the total pie of possibility if you think about it. When you break it down kind of more granularly, we always run with $10 million, $11 million worth of receivable or bad debt. So it\u2019s probably a number that\u2019s a little bit below that. And again, so that leaves probably another five to 10 potential long run. The really hard part, as I kind of mentioned in my remarks is, just the frequency and the process associated with this. So it\u2019s a pretty long process. Michael\u2019s teams all over it, we\u2019ve gotten the best transparency we could, but it does require both the resident and us to match information to get it run through the process. And then it takes a while to even after approved have the cash kind of come through the door and that\u2019s where the volatility arises in the numbers, which we wanted to highlight and be really clear about given what we have in guidance.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just on the expansion markets, as you look at the pipeline today and you look at kind of transaction volume broadly across multifamily, particularly in these markets. How quickly do you expect to get to scale? And I guess Austin and Atlanta and continue to ramp up in Denver.\nMark Parrell: Hey, thanks for that, Nick. It\u2019s Mark. And I\u2019m going to answer a little bit, and then I\u2019m going to kick it over to Alec Brackenridge, our CIO, who is on the call. So when we look at the expansion markets, we would suggest to you, they\u2019ll probably be one or two more expansion markets, probably more news to come on that in future quarters. Some of those markets, Atlanta is a particularly large market, Austin is a smaller market, so there\u2019s different volumes there. So I\u2019m going to kick it over to him to talk a little bit about how long it takes to kind of create a portfolio that makes sense in those markets. But I want to point out to you that it depends also on the saleability, we\u2019re able to continue to sell properties well, that\u2019ll fuel the engine to buy property as well. So it depends both on transaction volume in those new markets that Alec will speak to and our ability to continue to dispose as we very successfully done the date of properties at good prices in places like California, New York and DC, where we\u2019re trying to lighten the load a bit.\nAlec Brackenridge: Yes, following up on that, this is Alec. Atlanta is a really robust transactions market and we have great contacts there from the past, I\u2019ve worked in that market for almost 25 years now. And whether it\u2019s joint venture development or acquisitions, there\u2019s a wide range of things we can choose among. And generally the properties that we\u2019re looking at a roughly $80 million to $100 million, and what we\u2019re shooting to do over the next few years is to get to about $2 billion. So 20-ish properties, and we think we can achieve that. Austin is a smaller city. So that would be more in the $1 billion range, 10-ish properties, 10 to 12, maybe. But again, we have good feelers. We have a great team that has a lot of experience in these markets and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to accomplish.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Now moving to our next question that will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks a lot for the time. Maybe for Alec or Mark, I know you\u2019ve made the comments in the past, given where replacement costs are ground-up development doesn\u2019t pencil, particularly Manhattan, curious some more stable markets, Boston and DC. Do you think ground-up development pencils today?\nMark Parrell: We do have some deals we\u2019re working on John. So thanks for that question. It\u2019s Mark. And we do think in some cases, it does. We\u2019ve got some deals in the Northeast, a couple that we\u2019re likely to start the next quarter or two, where on current rents, we\u2019re looking at yields around five and a little bit higher. We liked the locations. We have to constantly refresh the portfolio. So I would say right now with us feeling a little better about construction costs and we can get into that. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re not going up, but we have a better handle than maybe we did in the middle of the pandemic. Our sense is that some of this development is going to make some sense to us and that we are going to do some of it selectively. And it\u2019s really going to help, I think, get us exposure in some of the suburbs of these established markets and some of these new markets we\u2019re trying to enter into.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then last one from me on operations. Michael, given all the leading indicators you see today, do you think you\u2019ll have to ramp up concessions back up in any markets later this year.\nMichael Manelis: Based on what you see today, I would say, no, we do not. There\u2019s a couple of areas I will tell you, like, the South Bay and San Francisco, which I think I\u2019ve said on previous calls, just from the volume of new supply being introduced into that sub-market and the proximity to some of our properties. I could see a little bit of that pressure from the new supply, bringing concessions back to some of the stabilized assets in that sub-market. But I don\u2019t see us reversing trend right now, given the strength that demand that we see. It\u2019s really more, if the demand stays strong enough to aid the absorption of the supply, that\u2019s coming in the back half of the year. That would be the only thing that could kind of impact the concession use on stabilized assets.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Now we will take a question from Rich Hightower with Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions here. I think as we think about guidance through the back half of the year, I\u2019m wondering, which markets sort of assume normal path of seasonality and which I think you mentioned a couple of which maybe aren\u2019t going to be on that normal seasonal path. And then how do we think about that set up for 2022? Do you expect all your markets to sort of resemble normal seasonal path in terms of market rents and so forth?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So I think first for the balance of this year, I would look at the Southern California markets and say, they\u2019re probably kind of going to be more in line with normal seasonal trends. And again, a lot is going to depend on what that strength the demand is, if you have a second wave of demand coming into these markets that is going to change the profile through the fourth quarter. And you think about next year, we are doing some things now with some lease terms for the new leases we\u2019re writing, but, again, we saw about a 5% shift. So we \u2013 meaning, we have about a 5% more explorations in the back half of 2021 that we normally would have otherwise seen. My guess is over the course of 2022 that clearly starts to mitigate back towards a normal pattern. But again, the strength of the fourth quarter this year could put us in a situation where we\u2019ll have more explorations in the fourth quarter of next year as well. So I still think it\u2019s a little too early to tell, what \u2013 how fast you\u2019re going to get back to a normal profile in the portfolio.\nRich Hightower: I guess, just to follow-up on, Michael, there\u2019s a lot of drivers of this sort of extraordinary demand going on right now, right. You\u2019ve got, two cohorts of college graduates filling the pipeline. You\u2019ve got people decoupling from mom and dad\u2019s basement and so forth. I mean, do you think that \u2013 does that set up a risk next year that there\u2019s going to be an air pocket relative to what\u2019s happening right now? Or do you think that\u2019s not a reasonable, maybe not an expectation, but a reasonable guess at what might be the case?\nMichael Manelis: I think when you look through our markets, we have such strong demand drivers and fundamentals, job growth, you have constrained housing. So I don\u2019t think this is like pulling future demand forward right now, what we\u2019re feeling. This is like our catch-up period. And then I think, again, a lot is going to depend around what does this second wave look like of demand coming to us in late Q3 and Q4? How strong is that? We\u2019ll play into kind of what we should expect for next year.\nMark Parrell: And Rich, it\u2019s Mark. Just to build on that. I do think next year, if you recall, late in 2019 and very early in 2020, we were doing well. The industry and this company we\u2019re doing well, we had good solid demand, our own internal statistics, as well as all the stuff we read from the analyst firms we subscribed to. So as our residents have kept their jobs, they have good income growth. So we\u2019re going to have the ability we think to access that demand, access that income growth, and just kind of not just catch up, which seems like to some extent, absent a real reversal in the pandemic, a foregone conclusion that we will get back where we were. We think we\u2019re going to keep right on going. And we say that with confidence now, again, assuming conditions in the economy running generally supportive, because we saw that great demand in 2019 and 2020 before the pandemic. I think that demand is still there, job growth still good. And we see that our demographic keeps getting raises, keeps being in demand and the shift to technology into the kind of jobs that make up our resident base continues. So we have a lot of reasons that we feel like this thing will have this big catch up, and then it\u2019s just going to have this continuation to it.\nRich Hightower: All right, great. Thanks for the comments, guys.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Next question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Great, good morning. Along those lines or a similar question, I was going to ask, if you can point to maybe something in the past or thoughts on the extended leasing season in 2022, but in particular, do you think it\u2019s a good indicator for renewals? You mentioned, you\u2019re at 55%, but talk to your point, things were really strong pre-COVID at around 60%. I was just curious if you \u2013 what are your thoughts on extended leasing season and maybe in a positive way could lead towards higher renewals in 2022?\nMichael Manelis: Absolutely. I mean, as you keep seeing the strength and demand coming in and you look at the recovery in these markets, you have to assume that we will fall back to kind of that higher retention level, which was renewing 60% of our residents. Right now, we are going to have a little bit of noise as we think about the back half of this year and those residents that moved in with us with concessions, moved in the second half of last year, came in with concessions at low rates. That\u2019s going to put a little bit of pressure on us from a retention perspective in the back half of this year, but again, the strength of the front door or that demand coming in is strong enough to backfill kind of that pressure on the renewals right now.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. And then just one question wanted to clarify dispositions, Mark, you specifically had mentioned California to confirm, are you thinking of selling similar older assets \u2013 lower growth assets in other parts of the country or just California.\nAlec Brackenridge: Hey, Jeff, this is Alec. Yes, we are considering another markets. We\u2019re selling in California right now because the bid is just so hot for it. But as that moves around the country and we think, markets like DC and New York with this improving fundamentals will also become harder investment markets and we\u2019ll list properties there. And we expect to move some property there.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Now we\u2019ll move to a question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Hi, everyone. In terms of the residents that are moving back into the portfolio in a couple markets, such as New York, San Francisco. Can you just give us a feel for what you\u2019re learning about those incoming renters? Did they used to be in the portfolio or are they younger. Anything sort of about the profile of the renters in those two cities would be helpful?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So not a lot of change and I would expand beyond just those two cities in any of our markets, right. When you think about the demographics coming in, and by that, I\u2019m going to refer to not only the age of the new residents that moved in the quarter, but also the average household income for those residents. So during the second quarter, our average age for move-ins was 30 \u2013 just over 33 years old, slightly below the historical average for second quarters in previous years, that was at 34, but pretty much right in line. And when you think about the overall affordability index, I\u2019ve said on previous calls, our range of rent as a percent of income between all of our markets goes between 17% at the low to 23% at the high. And as a portfolio for the move-ins that occurred in the second quarter, we were just over 19%. And that is very much in line with the historical averages for this portfolio. So I think what you take away from that is our rents clearly have increased sequentially, but so have the average household incomes for the residents that have been moving in. So sequentially, we averaged at $152,000 was the average household income in the second quarter. That\u2019s up from just under $150,000 for move-ins in the first quarter. So you can kind of see that balancing out and New York and San Francisco really kind of just fall right in line with the statements I just said.\nNick Yulico: Okay, great. Thanks. And then in terms of the moves into land to Austin, I know you talked some about this earlier about, creating scale. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if instead, there\u2019s any potential to do a larger portfolio transaction across the Sunbelt, maybe work with a developer or any sort of M&A potential that would be possible to kind of speed up some of that process, instead of buying individual assets in most Sunbelt markets.\nMark Parrell: It\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question, Nick. Alec and his team look at everything. So we\u2019re certainly open to portfolio transactions and indeed the Austin deals, we\u2019re a portfolio deal effectively. We\u2019re kind of bundled together. But again, when you start doing large scale transactions, you can end up competing against different groups of people. Some of the deals we\u2019ve done were off-market transactions, where we located them on our own. So we\u2019re very open to portfolio transactions. We\u2019re open for example, to OP unit, operating partnership unit deals, which often end up being larger deals as well. But we just haven\u2019t seen a lot of that offered. And a lot of the portfolios, we do see have some assets we like and a lot of assets we don\u2019t. So buying them one at a time gives us an advantage. And M&A is just a totally different conversation, requires a willing participant on the other side, often the payment of premiums and other things that can make the deal less economically useful, but still we underwrite that stuff too and think about it as well.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thanks, Mark.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Now we\u2019ll take a question from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So when I think about all these building blocks of improving fundamentals that don\u2019t yet kind of matriculate to the bottom line, you still have negative same-store growth, of course. But if you were pre-pandemic sort of 3%-ish, 4% type NOI same-store growth and you\u2019re down 8%, in the midst of it now or in the tail end of it, hopefully. Mark talked about the bounce back opportunity. Is there any reason mathematically that we wouldn\u2019t be talking about a mirror image of that move? So in other words, something like in the range of 10 double-digit type of a bounce back in 2022. Maybe not sustainable, but that\u2019s the kind of \u2013 sort of correction that might happen. And then we go back to more normal way type of growth in the years afterwards. Is that a reasonable way to think about it?\nMark Parrell: Hey, Rich, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. Bob may supplement or correct me as needed here. We\u2019re not going to give 2022 guidance, but I think your thought process, if conditions continue as Michael has described. The last two years we acknowledged 20 and this year 21 had been among the worst. There\u2019s a lot of reasons to believe 22 will be among the best years for EQF not the best and an exceptional year for same-store revenue growth and NOI. I think we\u2019ve got good discipline on the expense side. And so getting the double digits would require excellent expense controls as well. So we\u2019re not going to commit to a specific number, but the way the numbers just set themselves up is as these concessions go away, we report on a straight line basis. As we move rents up in a lot of cases beyond pre-pandemic numbers, the kind of math you\u2019re putting out there is certainly attainable.\nRich Anderson: Okay, great. And then the second question is, left out of the discussion so far has been the delta variant and the uncertainties that still lie ahead and clearly California has taken some steps. [Indiscernible] being sort of socially similar to California LA and San Francisco. Do you have any concern about getting too far ahead of your skis and that there\u2019s more to come with all this and we\u2019re not quite through it and there could be a hiccup along the way. Is that a part of your line of thinking at all at this point?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Rich, a very fair question. None of us here are experts. I\u2019m not an immunologist, but it seems to us that if the vaccines continue to provide protection to the vast, vast majority of people that are vaccinated. Then you\u2019re going to have a situation by protection, I mean, protection from serious illness or death. I think businesses are going to remain open. Cities are going to remain open. Things are \u2013 can continue to progress and our business will continue to improve. I\u2019m not as anxious about mask mandates, whether what the CDC did yesterday or some localities have done. I think to your point, we need to learn to manage this and live with this virus as much as we all were hoping it was just done and over, I think it\u2019s going to be part of our lives for an extended period of time. On the good side, we\u2019ve all sort of learned or many of us have learned how to live with it. And I think society will manage through it. I think if you do have widespread city closures, that could be a concern and would certainly be a derailer for us. I would say though, that as you think about the way we\u2019ve all learned about how lockdowns work, the mental health impact on people, the economic disarray that lockdowns close, these sort of city-wide shutdowns, the deferral of other needed medical procedures. There\u2019s a lot of good reasons, especially when you have a vaccine that 60% of the population over 16 is taken, at least one dose of that seems like a more thoughtful way to proceed along with masks to us. So we\u2019re not trying to whistle past the graveyard or otherwise ignore the Delta variant. It\u2019s just our sense that policymakers have different tools at their disposable \u2013 disposal, excuse me, in better knowledge than they did back in 2020. And that widespread lockdowns are not as likely as they were in the past.\nRich Anderson: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, everyone. Going back to the recoveries, I appreciate all the color on that. Was there any portion of that 15 million that was in the prior guide? And then additionally, is there any assumed improvement in the guide just from day-to-day collections in the second half?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So the 15 million referring to the rental assistance that was added to the guidance. It was not in the prior guide. We had kind of telegraphed on the first quarter call and, and even back to original guidance that we had assumed that collections would remain the same and that the bad debt level would be the same. So the 15 million is incremental. We\u2019re also added to the guidance. It was not in the prior guide also assuming that the collection rate, the 97% stays the same. So the only real change we made to the guidance was adding the 15,000,005 of which we\u2019ve already received on the rental assistance side.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, great. And then on California, you talked about how aftermarket is. Can you just walk through maybe any rationale for why that would be, because obviously we all know about the regulatory risk and sort of the lagging recovery, in that market. And then is there sort of a minimum size that you think about California representing in the portfolio?\nAlec Brackenridge: Hey, Brad, it\u2019s Alec. California is such a big state that I can\u2019t say that all parts of California are high. San Francisco right now has not had trades, downtown San Francisco as an example. But we have a broad portfolio and we find particularly for value add opportunities, there\u2019s just a wide, wide better pool. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in, as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019re selling properties are typically 18, 20 years old, and that appeals to that value add group.\nMichael Manelis: And just to add a little bit and answer the rest of the question. We think about what percent California could be of equity residential a few years into the future. Again, we\u2019re in the Bay Area, we\u2019re in Los Angeles, we\u2019re in San Diego, we\u2019re in orange county, great people, great properties in those markets. I think what you\u2019re going to see is we\u2019re going to do a little building. We\u2019re going to do a little buying in those markets, but generally speaking will be a net seller and our 45% asset exposure will go down below 40. And some of that capital will be redistributed to these expansion markets. And whether we get to the mid-30s or whether it\u2019s the high thirties, we\u2019ll just have to see. But we do want to mitigate a little of this regulatory risk in California. We want to be thoughtful about balancing out the portfolio. 45% is a pretty high concentration in any one state. So we think that\u2019s sort of a thoughtful way to balance things out a bit.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nMichael Manelis: Thank you,\nOperator: Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. We\u2019ll take the next question.\nRich Hill: Hey guys. Thanks for the thanks for making the time. Hey I\u2019m looking at your charts and your presentation where you compare your various different markets. And obviously Orange County, San Diego and Denver are doing really well. I\u2019m wondering do \u2013 does that strike you as a leading indicator for San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, where as people begin to move back rather than just moving out, we could see a sustainable shift higher and pricing trends. So long story, long question, but is the hot markets a leading indicator for some of the coastal markets that were weaker, but might have a sustain trajectory.\nMark Parrell: So Rich, it\u2019s Mark to start. And Michael, may you or Alec correct or supplement, but Orange County and San Diego for us are almost entirely suburban portfolios. And Denver is a little more urban than suburban, but has a big suburban component as well. So those markets have just really not been as affected and continue to progress right on straight through 2019 numbers. We think the leading indicators on coastals, what\u2019s going on in New York. So with the city, not even all the way opened a few months ago, we started a strong recovery. Now that recovery is in full swing. You see that recovery in San Francisco, Michael and I were there a month ago. And all our buildings are 95% occupied. Concessions are nearly non-existent. And that\u2019s before the city, at the end of June, it had just reopened. And it wasn\u2019t very activated to be honest. And the office population wasn\u2019t that high. So I would say to you, there are leading indicators to us. So the coastal markets are the coastal markets. I mean, they are already recovering and doing very well. I think what you\u2019re going to see a year from now is that if things, again, continue to be supportive as the coastal markets will just keep going, like they were in late 2019, early 2020, and that the recovery from the pandemic is not the limit of the upside in those markets.\nRich Hill: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Hey guys, maybe just a question on underwriting, not necessarily what you\u2019re underwriting, although I\u2019d love to hear it from you, but when you\u2019re selling a property, what do you think your buyers are underwriting? Because obviously buyers don\u2019t underwrite happening this quarter, next quarter, next year, they\u2019re taking a longer-term view. So as you think about the trends that, that buyers and sellers are underwriting in the current market, what does that look like in the out years?\nAlec Brackenridge: Well, Rich, this is Alec. I mean, buyers are optimists, right. I mean, that\u2019s why they\u2019re buying. And typically with a value add, they\u2019re pricing that in, but there\u2019s the only successful bidder right now is assuming a full recovery, or you\u2019re not going to be able to be the prevailing bid without doing that. And so that that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. And in terms of further out years, I really don\u2019t know per se each deal. I think everyone has their own view on long-term inflation, but what drives the cap rate in the short-term return are these either a value add, return or a return to pre-pandemic rents are plus on that.\nRich Hill: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I think that\u2019s it for me guys. Congrats on the nice quarter.\nMark Parrell: Thanks.\nAlec Brackenridge: Yes. Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Next question will come from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates.\nAlex Kalmus: Hi, thank you for taking the question. With the three properties in the pipeline expected to be completed this year. What are your expectations to replenishing the development pipeline at the end of the year?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. It\u2019s Mark. We expect to start three or four deals through the balance of the year, maybe $400 million to $500 million of \u2013 excuse me, construction cost to be incurred over the next few years on those. There\u2019s always some uncertainty. You just don\u2019t know if you get your GC lined up quite right. Couple of these deals are JVs. The deals are both in Denver, suburban and urban Denver, as well as in the Northeastern markets and suburban locations. So as we said, we will continue to invest in the suburbs of our established markets. And one of them is actually an urban deal in one of those markets. So we\u2019ll certainly go through the details with you next quarter, but we are looking to replenish the pipeline. And in fact, we\u2019re hopeful. There is \u2013 there was a question earlier in the call and I want to supplement the answer. I mean, right now there are most newer properties are going for some premium to replacement costs. So there is in our mind some reason to do more development, as long as you\u2019re thoughtful about what your construction costs are, your execution risks, how you\u2019re funding it. So I think you\u2019ll see us do a little bit more development. The deals I just mentioned, plus some other stuff we\u2019re working on in the near-term.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much. And looking at the transaction market again when you\u2019re thinking about the acquisitions, how do the cap rates on a stabilized basis compared to what the trailing 12 months were and what kind of NOI growth are you sort of baking into those assumptions?\nAlec Brackenridge: Well, Alex, this is Alec. Very so much property by property. Some of the properties were hurt more by the pandemic. So there\u2019s more of a recovery there. Others not so much, some of them have been \u2013 because they\u2019re newer properties are coming out of lease up. So there\u2019s a burn off of concessions, that\u2019s going on. So it\u2019s hard to give a blanket statement, but we\u2019re certainly seeing far fewer concessions than any of our markets and expecting a return to the run rate of rental growth over time.\nAlex Kalmus: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nAlec Brackenridge: Thank you.\nOperator: Amanda Sweitzer with Baird has a next question.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. If you think about lease rate growth in the near-term, are there still areas where you\u2019re facing since COVID-related restrictions in terms of your ability to push those lease rates? And then if there are how significant are they and what\u2019s kind of the outlook for them rolling off.\nMark Parrell: So yes, I mean, there are still several markets that we operate in that we are under restrictions on the ability to grow rate or grow the increase on renewals. I think that lessons as you get past the end of September, but there still will be some restrictions in place beyond that date. But I think we still, right now, we\u2019re looking at our opportunities as we get past that September to kind of keep pushing those rates in all of the markets that we\u2019re operating in.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then following up on through your San Francisco comments on the transaction market specifically, do you think that 4, 4 cap rate your reported for the smaller asset you sold in the suburbs is indicative of market pricing? Or has there just not been enough volume to tell yet?\nMark Parrell: Yes. There\u2019s not enough volume to tell. I mean, there\u2019s such a wide range in how properties are performing, that, that, there\u2019s not enough. I mean our expectation is that, cap rates will normalize there and lower over time. And there\u2019ll be a lot more bids since we\u2019re looking for.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Thank you. Appreciate the time.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question will come from John Kim, BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. On developments, Mark, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks doing more through joint venture arrangements. Can you provide some more color on what this may look like? Are you just a funding partner and you have the option to take it out, or do you see them being long-term partnerships?\nMark Parrell: Yes. More of the former, more we\u2019re partnering with local or regional, or maybe even national developer who has an embedded existing infrastructure of a deal finders, entitlement experts in markets, particularly the suburbs where we have less of a presence. Our development focus of late has been doing our own wholly-owned deals in urban centers, but in the suburbs, our established markets and in some of these new markets. So it would be us sort of renting that expertise in exchange for a promote, the developer building the deal as being the capital and having the right to purchase the asset at the end. So it\u2019s not a merchant build program in a sense that we\u2019re certainly happy to make money, but we want to end up with the asset at the end and add it to the portfolio and kind of help us fill things out.\nJohn Kim: And so what would it be the yield differential between joint ventures and on balance sheet developments?\nMark Parrell: Yes. That\u2019s a great question. We spent some time talking about that in some real life examples. So I\u2019m going to ballpark some of these numbers and would ask you to stick with me for a minute and Alec can sort of supplement that. But paying, promote does not have a terribly material impact on the yield, even in a fairly successful deal. So we thought about a deal where the unlevered IRR of the deal was something like 11% or 12%. And I believe it changed the acquisition yield for EQR from a 5.4% to a 5.2% cap rate of data. That\u2019s not 0, 20 basis points is real, but it \u2013 when you think about the fact that EQR doesn\u2019t have to carry all that overhead, it doesn\u2019t have good debt deal costs. Doesn\u2019t have failed deal costs and can be expert capital allocators. I mean, we all learned about some costs in business school, but it\u2019s still really hard to let go of a deal you\u2019ve worked on. When you\u2019re in our position as a capital allocator, not as only a developer, you\u2019re in a better position to pick and choose the opportunities that suit us best. Alec, you have anything?\nAlec Brackenridge: I would just add that the developers typically a really small part of the equity \u2013 overall equity, typically, 5% to 10%, we\u2019re 95% to 90%. So that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t really change the return to us as much as you might think.\nJohn Kim: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. My second question is on renovation CapEx, which has been trending down over the last couple of years, which totally understandable. But now that your markets are fully recovered, when do you expect that to ramp up and give the ability to do so to increase rents?\nMark Parrell: Yes. So we\u2019re looking at that all the time and we\u2019re pushing opportunities that we can, but I\u2019ll tell you, there are a lot of challenges right now just getting appliances and example, getting lumber as you\u2019ve heard, cabinets are hard. So the reasons why we\u2019re not picking up the pace outside of the immediate impact of the pandemic, which has abated in some of our markets, but our expectation is to increase that over the next 12 months.\nJohn Kim: Right. Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now hear from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you. And good morning out there. So two questions, first, just going back to a few analysts ago, when you guys were talking about managing the heavy two to three months pre explorations this fall. Is it your view that you are going to bring basically all of those to market like forced turnover? Or is it your view that will be sort of split some you\u2019ll stair-step, some you\u2019ll first force turnover, just trying to understand how much of that given the strong market demand, you guys talk about, how much of that you think you\u2019ll be able to get this year versus having to wait until next year to get it?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Hey, good morning. So a great question. And I\u2019ll tell you so far, we remain optimistic about the renewal performance for the remainder of the year. We just started in July and August to see the renewal quotes going out to folks that had previously come in with concession. So about 17% of our offers for July and August went out to those folks that received a concession. And so far the retention and ability to bring them up to market has played out. Now as we progress through September and into December, that number 17% grows to about 25% of our offers will be to individuals that came in on a concession. So the strong demand that we have right now is really driving the confidence and in our ability to backfill at current rates. So while we don\u2019t want to drive the additional vacancy, we\u2019re going to work with residents and potentially stair-step if the demand remains as strong as it is, we will bring everybody up to market, or we will have some increased turnover, because we can replace those units at higher rates in a very short order of time. So the other thing I just want to call out is, our residents are used to paying us that gross rent amount and the concessions that we granted were granted in usually the first or second full month of occupancy with that. So our challenge and our opportunity is really more around bringing them up to the gross street rent that you see today. And like I said, if the demand at the front door remains as strong as it is, we have a high degree of confidence because there are options to go elsewhere in that market are going to be very limited, because we\u2019re at market rates now.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. So basically you\u2019re saying that when you guys offer the whatever two months free, three months free, that was at the initial first month. And since then the people have been paying the full freight.\nMark Parrell: That is correct.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Second question is, as you guys have returned to markets, like, I mean, you\u2019ve been back in Denver a while, but Austin, Atlanta, et cetera, when you compare now versus when you were previously in those markets, what would you say is your biggest sort of shock if you will, is it household income? Is it how the areas have built up lack of supply? Is it better product than what you used to own? I\u2019m just sort of curious how you compare when you guys left those markets to now, and what\u2019s been the most, the biggest change that you\u2019ve encountered, obviously that makes you excited to reenter, but I\u2019m just curious the biggest change that you\u2019ve noticed.\nAlec Brackenridge: Yes. So there are quite a few of those things in \u2013 Alexander, this is Alec. The change, but the primary thing that we look for in a new market is that renter, the knowledge-based industry renter, who\u2019s got a resilient job, growing income. And on that, that those numbers are up dramatically in Atlanta and certainly in Austin, but also in Denver. And that comes then with these much more vibrant urban settings that they\u2019re choosing to live in and kind of foster and be part of. And that\u2019s a big part of why, they stay in these neighborhoods longer than in the old days. And we had a lot \u2013 we had much lower rents. We had much more turnover and single family home prices were so much lower, particularly in the kind of neighborhoods that folks were living that already there was choosing to live in. So that was a big source of competition. Whereas today, in a market like Atlanta to find a affordable house, you have to go out really far. And a lot of people just don\u2019t want to make that trade off when they\u2019re been living in Midtown or Midtown West or Buckhead, they\u2019re enjoying the life that they have, and they\u2019re just less likely to move out. And that that\u2019s been a big change from where the way it was when we were there 10, 15 years ago.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And that\u2019s a great question now. So I\u2019m just going to build on it. It\u2019s Mark. I mean, rents that we used to charge were a $1, $1.50 rents. And our situation when we exited those markets was our best renters could immediately afford to purchase a home. And our worst renters didn\u2019t pay us and left in the middle of the night. And it was a whole different demographic. And now this demographic is much more like a coastal demographic. They\u2019re well employed in financial technology, new media, other fields, they enjoy these urban amenities and these dense suburban amenities. They might want to buy a home, but home prices, we spent a lot of time on this in Atlanta because average prices in Atlanta for the metro aren\u2019t very high for homes. There were about the national average, but any areas near where the employment centers are people work and the neighborhoods that Alec mentioned they want to live, it is quite high. Atlanta has got a lot of traffic. So if you want to move, just like you can move in New York, you can move to you qualify, but it\u2019s a good distance where in before in Atlanta, it wasn\u2019t much of a distance. So again, we got a lot of our folks siphoned. So we\u2019re looking at rents in a $2 to $2.5 a foot in these areas, double what it was before a demographic that\u2019s got much higher incomes, single family situation that to us looks a lot better than it did when we left these markets a decade or a decade ago. And then again, that combines with the political risk that you and I and others have talked about on these calls for a long time. That\u2019s considerably more favorable than some of the other markets were.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So just to sum that up, would you guys look at the some income like you guys, which I think sort of the team at 23 year or 17 to 23 in general, are these markets where you see are now in the lower end of there, therefore you see more of an opportunity to push growth \u2013 or are those markets just more structurally the rental income levels are structurally lower versus the New York, et cetera.\nMark Parrell: Yes. I missed a little of that question, but generally speaking, the rental income ratios are higher in the markets we\u2019re going into. We think that\u2019ll be offset a little bit by pretty good growth in incomes by those residents, because those areas are growing so much. I\u2019ll also say that some of the cost structures, like the fact that there\u2019s no tech taxes in Texas matter as well. So it isn\u2019t an apples to apples comparison, but the ratios in places like New York are lower than places like Atlanta.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you. Thank you, Mark.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Now we\u2019ll take a question from Haendel St. Juste, Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey guys, I guess it\u2019s still a good morning out there. Just two quick ones from me. I want to ask you, if you could talk a bit more specifically or share the math and how you underwrote the IRR on the assets you bought here in Atlanta and Austin. And how that compares to the IRRs on the assets that you underwrote when we sold that.\nMark Parrell: I\u2019m sorry. Can you repeat the question?\nHaendel St. Juste: Can you hear me?\nMark Parrell: Yes, I\u2019m sorry.\nHaendel St. Juste: So my questions on the comparative \u2013 my question is on the comparative IRRs, if you could talk a bit more specifically on how you underwrote the IRRs, but what you\u2019re buying in Atlanta and Austin and how they compare it\u2026\nMark Parrell: Got it. Got it. I missed the first part. Yes. So the big \u2013 one of the big differences age of the property. So we\u2019re selling properties that are a lot older that have, typically have capital needs. And again, we find buyers who look at the future a little differently than we do, want to invest the value add money. So when we look at that, we\u2019re not sure you\u2019re going to get the return on that. So it ends up in a lower IRR. The properties we\u2019re buying, we just see such strong demand for that. We think that that IRR over time will exceed, the one we\u2019re seeing. As a result of a combination of higher rent growth and less CapEx.\nHaendel St. Juste: So to be a bit more specific, I think you bought assets at 3.8 in a quarter you filled it 4.0, you\u2019ve mentioned in the past that you were looking to do these max funded deals on a net neutral to IRR basis. So I was curious if that was indeed the case here, are you able to underwrite where you\u2019re basically.\nMark Parrell: So the numbers here exciting with the cap rates going in yields. What I was referring to as the longer-term IRR. You think the IRRs are higher and what \u2013 yes, Haendel, IRRs are higher on what we\u2019re buying and what we\u2019re selling and the cap rates are the same. So one good question that we\u2019ve been talking about on these calls is, are our shareholders going to miss out on some of the recovery on some of these assets we\u2019re selling, because we\u2019ve talked, it\u2019s going to be pretty strong income growth in California and New York. And I\u2019d say that there\u2019s not going to be the case because we\u2019re not selling the best assets with the best income growth. Our selling assets that have regulatory challenges or concentration issues where we own so much already in that submarket that the shareholders will get the benefit. Whereas Alec said, we just don\u2019t believe in the renovation play. So I think just again, we\u2019re selling what we believe our lower IRRs and buying higher, and we believe that\u2019s true both on the NOI side and on the net cash flow because of the CapEx.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it, Mark. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then you\u2019ve mentioned development entities a few times here in your remarks and the Q&A, and you\u2019ve got line the risk on bouncy development. So certainly it sounds like building out an internal platform is just not in the cards near-term. I guess my question is how much more fruit do you think there\u2019s less to shake from your existing relationships like say toll brothers. You guys have a history of working together, looks like you bought one of your Atlanta assets from them. They have a large development footprint, a lot of \u2013 let\u2019s call it attractive markets. So they seem like an ideal partner. So I guess what\u2019s the perceived opportunity there, are you having conversations, and is that kind of fit the profile of the apartment you\u2019d be looking for?\nMark Parrell: Well, first I just want to correct the beginning statement. We have a terrific existing development team. It just isn\u2019t in Atlanta. It isn\u2019t in Austin and it mostly isn\u2019t in Denver. So our development team, not as large as some of our competitors, but very capable, certainly exists that teams delivered Alcott this enormous $400 million building on time and on budget during a pandemic. So we\u2019ve got a very capable team and they\u2019ll continue to focus on things. For example, our California team, we\u2019ve got a lot of densification deals that we\u2019ve mentioned on occasion, but you\u2019ll hear more about in the next few years. And these are deals where, for example, Haendel, we have a 300 unit deal. You take down 60 units in a garden style, structure and you put up mid-rise 200 units. Those are terrific deals for EQR those we do on our own. We don\u2019t need a partner for that. So we\u2019re open to all sorts of partnership opportunities, again, national, local, regional, you should expect that we\u2019re exploring all of those things at this point. And we\u2019re thought of as high quality partner and we\u2019re looking for a high quality counterparty.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. And did not mean to diminish the team in any way. I was just making the point that obviously it could be largely given a company of your scale and just probing on if there are any opportunities under discussion today with, with toll brothers as I indicated, you \u2013 if you know, obviously you\u2019d be bought the asset in Atlanta from them was curious on it that was a fruit, the tree that could bear more fruit.\nMark Parrell: Sure. Haendel, I don\u2019t mean to be defensive. I just want to acknowledge the contribution to the team. We got a lot of people working hard, a lot of people listening to this call. As it relates to any specific party, I mean, if we were doing something I couldn\u2019t tell you, and if we\u2019re not, it wouldn\u2019t matter. So I just would say, we\u2019re out there, we\u2019re always talking to people and that\u2019s Alec\u2019s job. He has a whole team that is out there talking to developers of all shapes and sizes.\nHaendel St. Juste: Well, I have to ask. But thank you for taking my questions and response. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: And there appears to be no additional questions in the queue. I will turn the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Well, thank you, everyone for your time today. Enjoy the rest of the summer and we\u2019ll see you on the conference circuit in the fall. Thank you.\nOperator: With that ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. As evidenced by our revised guidance, the pace of recovery has been very strong. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overall trends. So first, we continue to see very good demand for our apartment homes. Our national call center and Ella, our AI leasing agent are responding to record high levels of inbound interest for our apartments, which is converting into high volumes of self guided tours. This overall level of demand continues to drive applications and moving activity that is exceeding move out and ultimately is delivering stronger than expected recovery and occupancy. Portfolio wide, physical occupancy is currently 96.5%, which is back to 2019 levels. San Francisco and Seattle are still trending slightly below 2019 and Southern California markets are slightly above. At this point, we expect to run the portfolio above 96% through the remainder of the third quarter. This strength and occupancy is allowing us to push rate and drive revenue growth. Overall, we are more than halfway through the typical peak leasing season and the momentum has been very strong providing us the opportunity to raise rates, reduce concessions, and grow occupancy. These fundamentals are delivering RV recovery from March to December of 2020 pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions declined approximately $500 per unit. From January 2021 to today, pricing trend has grown $660 and is now not only above prior year levels in all markets, but every market except for San Francisco is also above 2019 peak pricing trend levels. Today, the portfolio is approximately $100 higher per unit than our peak 2019 levels. Our priority has been to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. At the end of the first quarter, about 20% of applications were receiving on average four weeks in concessions. As of July, we are now running with less than 3% of our applications receiving on average just over two weeks. And we expect this to continue to drop off even further. To give you perspective, the total dollar of concessions granted peaked in the month of February at just north of $6 million for the same-store portfolio. For July, we will be at $1.5 million for the month and August should be less than $750,000. Last week, only 12 properties had any concessions being offered. The percent of residents renewing has stabilized around 55%, which is very much in line with historical averages, but below the record high 60% levels that we had in 2019 and early 2020. As you saw in the press release achieved renewal increase, new lease change and blended rate all continued to improve in July and we expect further improvements through the balance of the year as the comp period becomes more favorable and the business continues to strengthen. As we progress through the remainder of the year, our focus will continue to be to push rates in our markets and manage our renewal negotiations. In our management presentation, we provided color on all of our markets, but I wanted to take a minute to highlight New York and San Francisco, as they tend to be the markets we received the most questions about. Both markets are recovering nicely with concession use nearly non-existent in our New York portfolio and declining rapidly in San Francisco. New York is seeing stronger demand right now, and we think it is primarily due to greater clarity around employer returned to office plans. New York employers, particularly the banks and financial firms have called their employees back to the office and you could feel it in the economic activity in many areas of Manhattan. We see it in our portfolio after nine consecutive weeks of record application volume. In San Francisco, however, the return to office and reopening is a little more ambiguous. Employers have been slower to call employees back in with many initially targeting after Labor Day. Adding to the uncertainty in San Francisco is the reintroduction of strong recommendations for indoor masking and some delays in reopening, which were announced last week. The situation in San Francisco is likely to lead to a delayed leasing season in that market and a slower full recovery of occupancy. That said, occupancy is 95.4% today in San Francisco and is growing as is pricing trends. At this pace, we expect the San Francisco pricing trend to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, we are seeing some indicators that we could see an extended leasing season with a second wave of demand in New York, Boston and Seattle. Our leasing teams in these markets have been dealing with prospects that are looking for moving dates in late August and September and hearing from them that these moves are in connection with their need to be back in the office or in the case of Boston back on campus. This demand is more robust than historical patterns, which could suggest an extended peak leasing season in those markets and matches up nicely with our lease expirations, which are more weighted towards the back of the year than usual. Combining all of the data points I've just shared and those included in the management presentation, we see an unprecedented opportunity to grow sequential revenue over the next several quarters as the impact of better rates, nearly non-existing concessions and higher occupancy compound. We acknowledge how badly our operations declined over the last 16 months, but the current recovery appears to be strong enough to both quickly recapture all that was lost in the pandemic and take us into a new period of strong operating fundamentals. Finally, I want to take a minute and give you an update on the government assistance program for renters. As we've discussed on previous calls, approximately $50 billion in rental assistance for those impacted financially by the pandemic was made available in the various relief bills. We are laser focused on accessing the rental relief funds and are working very closely with our eligible residents to apply for this relief. Processing to-date has been relatively slow in our markets, but we were able to recover approximately $5 million in the quarter. Bob will provide some color on our expectations for collections for the remainder of 2021 in his remarks. Let me close by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. This pace of recovery would not be possible without them and they remain relentless and taking care of each other and serving our customers. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob. Based on what you see today, I would say, no, we do not. There's a couple of areas I will tell you, like, the South Bay and San Francisco, which I think I've said on previous calls, just from the volume of new supply being introduced into that sub-market and the proximity to some of our properties. I could see a little bit of that pressure from the new supply, bringing concessions back to some of the stabilized assets in that sub-market. But I don't see us reversing trend right now, given the strength that demand that we see. It's really more, if the demand stays strong enough to aid the absorption of the supply, that's coming in the back half of the year. That would be the only thing that could kind of impact the concession use on stabilized assets. Thanks, John. Yes. So I think first for the balance of this year, I would look at the Southern California markets and say, they're probably kind of going to be more in line with normal seasonal trends. And again, a lot is going to depend on what that strength the demand is, if you have a second wave of demand coming into these markets that is going to change the profile through the fourth quarter. And you think about next year, we are doing some things now with some lease terms for the new leases we're writing, but, again, we saw about a 5% shift. So we \u2013 meaning, we have about a 5% more explorations in the back half of 2021 that we normally would have otherwise seen. My guess is over the course of 2022 that clearly starts to mitigate back towards a normal pattern. But again, the strength of the fourth quarter this year could put us in a situation where we'll have more explorations in the fourth quarter of next year as well. So I still think it's a little too early to tell, what \u2013 how fast you're going to get back to a normal profile in the portfolio. I think when you look through our markets, we have such strong demand drivers and fundamentals, job growth, you have constrained housing. So I don't think this is like pulling future demand forward right now, what we're feeling. This is like our catch-up period. And then I think, again, a lot is going to depend around what does this second wave look like of demand coming to us in late Q3 and Q4? How strong is that? We'll play into kind of what we should expect for next year. Absolutely. I mean, as you keep seeing the strength and demand coming in and you look at the recovery in these markets, you have to assume that we will fall back to kind of that higher retention level, which was renewing 60% of our residents. Right now, we are going to have a little bit of noise as we think about the back half of this year and those residents that moved in with us with concessions, moved in the second half of last year, came in with concessions at low rates. That's going to put a little bit of pressure on us from a retention perspective in the back half of this year, but again, the strength of the front door or that demand coming in is strong enough to backfill kind of that pressure on the renewals right now. Yes. So not a lot of change and I would expand beyond just those two cities in any of our markets, right. When you think about the demographics coming in, and by that, I'm going to refer to not only the age of the new residents that moved in the quarter, but also the average household income for those residents. So during the second quarter, our average age for move-ins was 30 \u2013 just over 33 years old, slightly below the historical average for second quarters in previous years, that was at 34, but pretty much right in line. And when you think about the overall affordability index, I've said on previous calls, our range of rent as a percent of income between all of our markets goes between 17% at the low to 23% at the high. And as a portfolio for the move-ins that occurred in the second quarter, we were just over 19%. And that is very much in line with the historical averages for this portfolio. So I think what you take away from that is our rents clearly have increased sequentially, but so have the average household incomes for the residents that have been moving in. So sequentially, we averaged at $152,000 was the average household income in the second quarter. That's up from just under $150,000 for move-ins in the first quarter. So you can kind of see that balancing out and New York and San Francisco really kind of just fall right in line with the statements I just said. Yes. Rich, a very fair question. None of us here are experts. I'm not an immunologist, but it seems to us that if the vaccines continue to provide protection to the vast, vast majority of people that are vaccinated. Then you're going to have a situation by protection, I mean, protection from serious illness or death. I think businesses are going to remain open. Cities are going to remain open. Things are \u2013 can continue to progress and our business will continue to improve. I'm not as anxious about mask mandates, whether what the CDC did yesterday or some localities have done. I think to your point, we need to learn to manage this and live with this virus as much as we all were hoping it was just done and over, I think it's going to be part of our lives for an extended period of time. On the good side, we've all sort of learned or many of us have learned how to live with it. And I think society will manage through it. I think if you do have widespread city closures, that could be a concern and would certainly be a derailer for us. I would say though, that as you think about the way we've all learned about how lockdowns work, the mental health impact on people, the economic disarray that lockdowns close, these sort of city-wide shutdowns, the deferral of other needed medical procedures. There's a lot of good reasons, especially when you have a vaccine that 60% of the population over 16 is taken, at least one dose of that seems like a more thoughtful way to proceed along with masks to us. So we're not trying to whistle past the graveyard or otherwise ignore the Delta variant. It's just our sense that policymakers have different tools at their disposable \u2013 disposal, excuse me, in better knowledge than they did back in 2020. And that widespread lockdowns are not as likely as they were in the past. Yes. So the 15 million referring to the rental assistance that was added to the guidance. It was not in the prior guide. We had kind of telegraphed on the first quarter call and, and even back to original guidance that we had assumed that collections would remain the same and that the bad debt level would be the same. So the 15 million is incremental. We're also added to the guidance. It was not in the prior guide also assuming that the collection rate, the 97% stays the same. So the only real change we made to the guidance was adding the 15,000,005 of which we've already received on the rental assistance side. And just to add a little bit and answer the rest of the question. We think about what percent California could be of equity residential a few years into the future. Again, we're in the Bay Area, we're in Los Angeles, we're in San Diego, we're in orange county, great people, great properties in those markets. I think what you're going to see is we're going to do a little building. We're going to do a little buying in those markets, but generally speaking will be a net seller and our 45% asset exposure will go down below 40. And some of that capital will be redistributed to these expansion markets. And whether we get to the mid-30s or whether it's the high thirties, we'll just have to see. But we do want to mitigate a little of this regulatory risk in California. We want to be thoughtful about balancing out the portfolio. 45% is a pretty high concentration in any one state. So we think that's sort of a thoughtful way to balance things out a bit. Thank you,"

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Marty, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I will give some brief remarks on our operating trajectory and investment activity. Then Michael Manelis will follow with some top level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see the remainder of the year playing out, followed by Bob Garechana adding color on our guidance changes and balance sheet. And then we'll take your questions. Also, as Marty mentioned, we are pleased to have Alec Brackenridge, EQR's Chief Investment Officer available during the Q&A period. For those of you who do not know Alec, he's a 28-year veteran of this company. He literally started work here the day we went public in 1993 and took over as our CIO in 2020. As you can see from the release, he and his team have done exceptional work of late on the transaction side. Turning to operations. All of our operating metrics continue to improve at a faster rate than we assumed earlier in the year. We're seeing demand levels well above 2019 in all our markets. And this has allowed us to continue growing occupancy while at the same time raising rates. This resulted in the company materially raising annual same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO guidance. While our quarter-over-quarter same-store revenue and NOI results remained negative. The decline was less than what we expected and our sequential same-store revenue and NOI showed positive growth for the first time since the pandemic began. As we have discussed on prior calls improvement are reported quarter-over-quarter same-store numbers will lag the recovery in our operating fundamentals, as we work these now higher rents and lower concessions through our rent roll. We believe that our business is set up for an extended period of higher than trend growth beginning in 2022, as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes in our target demographic. Also the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward. On the investment side, we're active buyers and sellers in the second quarter and expect to continue being active capital recyclers. Consistent with what I've said on prior calls, we are allocating capital to places that are attractive to our affluent renter base, including the suburbs of our established coastal markets, as well as Denver and our two new markets of Austin and Atlanta. We are making these trades with no dilution, even given higher pricing levels for the properties we are targeting, because we're able to sell our older and less desirable properties at low cap rates and at prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates. Earlier this month, we re-entered the Texas market after an 11-year absence by acquiring two well located new assets in Austin, Texas. These properties are located in a desirable area with high housing costs. That is equidistant between downtown Austin and the domain hub on the North side. We acquired these two properties for $96 million and approximately 3.9% cap rate and about $195,000 per unit. We expect to acquire a mix of urban and suburban assets in the Austin market. During the second quarter, and in July, we acquired two properties in Atlanta, Skyhouse South in Midtown for $115 million at a 3.6% cap rate. This is a deal we did previously disclose. And a few days ago, we acquired a second property in Atlanta and the Bustling Midtown west neighborhood. We acquired this new property for $135 million, and it is about half occupied. And once it completes lease-up, we expect it will stabilize at 4.1% cap rate. We also continued adding our Denver presence by purchasing an asset in the suburban Central Park area of Denver for $95 million. This property is located just west of the large and growing Fitzsimons medical campus and draws residents attracted to its access to abundant outdoor amenities. We expect this property, which is also in lease up currently to stabilize at a 4.2% cap rate. We're also pleased to add to the portfolio of property each in the suburbs of Boston and Washington, D.C. The Boston property is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, and is a new asset that we acquired for $134.5 million at a 4.1% cap rate. This property is in a difficult to build suburb of Boston with high single family housing costs and good access to high paying jobs. The DC asset is located in Fairfax, Virginia, and is a 2016 asset that we acquired for $70 million at a 4.3% cap rate. This property is well located with both good highway and good metro access and proximity to growing job base in Northern Virginia. Both the Burlington and Fairfax assets are located in sub markets or our existing assets have performed particularly well. Year-to-date, we have bought $645 million of properties and expect to close on another $850 million in acquisitions. A good number of which are in various states of advanced negotiation by the end of the year. We'll fund these buys with an approximately equivalent amount of dispositions, mostly from California of older and less desirable assets, which we sold or under contract to sell at significantly above our pre-pandemic estimate of value. Turning to development. We put into service and began leasing our newly developed property in Alameda Island, a short ferry ride to the city of San Francisco, built on the site of a former naval base. This property has terrific views of the skyline and an evolving restaurant and bar scene that we think is attractive to our clientele. Over the next few months, we will complete our other two current development projects, including the Alcott in Central Boston, the largest development project in the company's history, early leasing efforts on this project and our development project in Bethesda, Maryland are going well. And our current estimates are that these three projects will stabilize at a development yield of approximately 5%, considerably higher than prevailing acquisition cap rates. These properties will be meaningful contributors to NFFO starting in late 2022. We see development as a good compliment to our acquisition activities, as we spread more of our footprint to the suburbs of our established markets, as well as to our new markets. We expect a significant amount of our development activity going forward to be done through joint venture arrangements. This allows us to leverage our partners in place sourcing and entitlement teams in locations like our new markets, where we do not currently have a development presence. Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You are doing an exceptional job during this particularly busy leasing season. And we're all very proud and grateful. Go ahead, Michael. Hey, thanks for that, Nick. It's Mark. And I'm going to answer a little bit, and then I'm going to kick it over to Alec Brackenridge, our CIO, who is on the call. So when we look at the expansion markets, we would suggest to you, they'll probably be one or two more expansion markets, probably more news to come on that in future quarters. Some of those markets, Atlanta is a particularly large market, Austin is a smaller market, so there's different volumes there. So I'm going to kick it over to him to talk a little bit about how long it takes to kind of create a portfolio that makes sense in those markets. But I want to point out to you that it depends also on the saleability, we're able to continue to sell properties well, that'll fuel the engine to buy property as well. So it depends both on transaction volume in those new markets that Alec will speak to and our ability to continue to dispose as we very successfully done the date of properties at good prices in places like California, New York and DC, where we're trying to lighten the load a bit. We do have some deals we're working on John. So thanks for that question. It's Mark. And we do think in some cases, it does. We've got some deals in the Northeast, a couple that we're likely to start the next quarter or two, where on current rents, we're looking at yields around five and a little bit higher. We liked the locations. We have to constantly refresh the portfolio. So I would say right now with us feeling a little better about construction costs and we can get into that. It's not that they're not going up, but we have a better handle than maybe we did in the middle of the pandemic. Our sense is that some of this development is going to make some sense to us and that we are going to do some of it selectively. And it's really going to help, I think, get us exposure in some of the suburbs of these established markets and some of these new markets we're trying to enter into. And Rich, it's Mark. Just to build on that. I do think next year, if you recall, late in 2019 and very early in 2020, we were doing well. The industry and this company we're doing well, we had good solid demand, our own internal statistics, as well as all the stuff we read from the analyst firms we subscribed to. So as our residents have kept their jobs, they have good income growth. So we're going to have the ability we think to access that demand, access that income growth, and just kind of not just catch up, which seems like to some extent, absent a real reversal in the pandemic, a foregone conclusion that we will get back where we were. We think we're going to keep right on going. And we say that with confidence now, again, assuming conditions in the economy running generally supportive, because we saw that great demand in 2019 and 2020 before the pandemic. I think that demand is still there, job growth still good. And we see that our demographic keeps getting raises, keeps being in demand and the shift to technology into the kind of jobs that make up our resident base continues. So we have a lot of reasons that we feel like this thing will have this big catch up, and then it's just going to have this continuation to it. Thanks, Rich. It's Mark. Thanks for the question, Nick. Alec and his team look at everything. So we're certainly open to portfolio transactions and indeed the Austin deals, we're a portfolio deal effectively. We're kind of bundled together. But again, when you start doing large scale transactions, you can end up competing against different groups of people. Some of the deals we've done were off-market transactions, where we located them on our own. So we're very open to portfolio transactions. We're open for example, to OP unit, operating partnership unit deals, which often end up being larger deals as well. But we just haven't seen a lot of that offered. And a lot of the portfolios, we do see have some assets we like and a lot of assets we don't. So buying them one at a time gives us an advantage. And M&A is just a totally different conversation, requires a willing participant on the other side, often the payment of premiums and other things that can make the deal less economically useful, but still we underwrite that stuff too and think about it as well. Thanks, Nick. Hey, Rich, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. Bob may supplement or correct me as needed here. We're not going to give 2022 guidance, but I think your thought process, if conditions continue as Michael has described. The last two years we acknowledged 20 and this year 21 had been among the worst. There's a lot of reasons to believe 22 will be among the best years for EQF not the best and an exceptional year for same-store revenue growth and NOI. I think we've got good discipline on the expense side. And so getting the double digits would require excellent expense controls as well. So we're not going to commit to a specific number, but the way the numbers just set themselves up is as these concessions go away, we report on a straight line basis. As we move rents up in a lot of cases beyond pre-pandemic numbers, the kind of math you're putting out there is certainly attainable. So Rich, it's Mark to start. And Michael, may you or Alec correct or supplement, but Orange County and San Diego for us are almost entirely suburban portfolios. And Denver is a little more urban than suburban, but has a big suburban component as well. So those markets have just really not been as affected and continue to progress right on straight through 2019 numbers. We think the leading indicators on coastals, what's going on in New York. So with the city, not even all the way opened a few months ago, we started a strong recovery. Now that recovery is in full swing. You see that recovery in San Francisco, Michael and I were there a month ago. And all our buildings are 95% occupied. Concessions are nearly non-existent. And that's before the city, at the end of June, it had just reopened. And it wasn't very activated to be honest. And the office population wasn't that high. So I would say to you, there are leading indicators to us. So the coastal markets are the coastal markets. I mean, they are already recovering and doing very well. I think what you're going to see a year from now is that if things, again, continue to be supportive as the coastal markets will just keep going, like they were in late 2019, early 2020, and that the recovery from the pandemic is not the limit of the upside in those markets. Thanks. Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. It's Mark. We expect to start three or four deals through the balance of the year, maybe $400 million to $500 million of \u2013 excuse me, construction cost to be incurred over the next few years on those. There's always some uncertainty. You just don't know if you get your GC lined up quite right. Couple of these deals are JVs. The deals are both in Denver, suburban and urban Denver, as well as in the Northeastern markets and suburban locations. So as we said, we will continue to invest in the suburbs of our established markets. And one of them is actually an urban deal in one of those markets. So we'll certainly go through the details with you next quarter, but we are looking to replenish the pipeline. And in fact, we're hopeful. There is \u2013 there was a question earlier in the call and I want to supplement the answer. I mean, right now there are most newer properties are going for some premium to replacement costs. So there is in our mind some reason to do more development, as long as you're thoughtful about what your construction costs are, your execution risks, how you're funding it. So I think you'll see us do a little bit more development. The deals I just mentioned, plus some other stuff we're working on in the near-term. So yes, I mean, there are still several markets that we operate in that we are under restrictions on the ability to grow rate or grow the increase on renewals. I think that lessons as you get past the end of September, but there still will be some restrictions in place beyond that date. But I think we still, right now, we're looking at our opportunities as we get past that September to kind of keep pushing those rates in all of the markets that we're operating in. Yes. There's not enough volume to tell. I mean, there's such a wide range in how properties are performing, that, that, there's not enough. I mean our expectation is that, cap rates will normalize there and lower over time. And there'll be a lot more bids since we're looking for. Thank you. Yes. More of the former, more we're partnering with local or regional, or maybe even national developer who has an embedded existing infrastructure of a deal finders, entitlement experts in markets, particularly the suburbs where we have less of a presence. Our development focus of late has been doing our own wholly-owned deals in urban centers, but in the suburbs, our established markets and in some of these new markets. So it would be us sort of renting that expertise in exchange for a promote, the developer building the deal as being the capital and having the right to purchase the asset at the end. So it's not a merchant build program in a sense that we're certainly happy to make money, but we want to end up with the asset at the end and add it to the portfolio and kind of help us fill things out. Yes. That's a great question. We spent some time talking about that in some real life examples. So I'm going to ballpark some of these numbers and would ask you to stick with me for a minute and Alec can sort of supplement that. But paying, promote does not have a terribly material impact on the yield, even in a fairly successful deal. So we thought about a deal where the unlevered IRR of the deal was something like 11% or 12%. And I believe it changed the acquisition yield for EQR from a 5.4% to a 5.2% cap rate of data. That's not 0, 20 basis points is real, but it \u2013 when you think about the fact that EQR doesn't have to carry all that overhead, it doesn't have good debt deal costs. Doesn't have failed deal costs and can be expert capital allocators. I mean, we all learned about some costs in business school, but it's still really hard to let go of a deal you've worked on. When you're in our position as a capital allocator, not as only a developer, you're in a better position to pick and choose the opportunities that suit us best. Alec, you have anything? Yes. So we're looking at that all the time and we're pushing opportunities that we can, but I'll tell you, there are a lot of challenges right now just getting appliances and example, getting lumber as you've heard, cabinets are hard. So the reasons why we're not picking up the pace outside of the immediate impact of the pandemic, which has abated in some of our markets, but our expectation is to increase that over the next 12 months. Yes. Hey, good morning. So a great question. And I'll tell you so far, we remain optimistic about the renewal performance for the remainder of the year. We just started in July and August to see the renewal quotes going out to folks that had previously come in with concession. So about 17% of our offers for July and August went out to those folks that received a concession. And so far the retention and ability to bring them up to market has played out. Now as we progress through September and into December, that number 17% grows to about 25% of our offers will be to individuals that came in on a concession. So the strong demand that we have right now is really driving the confidence and in our ability to backfill at current rates. So while we don't want to drive the additional vacancy, we're going to work with residents and potentially stair-step if the demand remains as strong as it is, we will bring everybody up to market, or we will have some increased turnover, because we can replace those units at higher rates in a very short order of time. So the other thing I just want to call out is, our residents are used to paying us that gross rent amount and the concessions that we granted were granted in usually the first or second full month of occupancy with that. So our challenge and our opportunity is really more around bringing them up to the gross street rent that you see today. And like I said, if the demand at the front door remains as strong as it is, we have a high degree of confidence because there are options to go elsewhere in that market are going to be very limited, because we're at market rates now. That is correct. Yes. And that's a great question now. So I'm just going to build on it. It's Mark. I mean, rents that we used to charge were a $1, $1.50 rents. And our situation when we exited those markets was our best renters could immediately afford to purchase a home. And our worst renters didn't pay us and left in the middle of the night. And it was a whole different demographic. And now this demographic is much more like a coastal demographic. They're well employed in financial technology, new media, other fields, they enjoy these urban amenities and these dense suburban amenities. They might want to buy a home, but home prices, we spent a lot of time on this in Atlanta because average prices in Atlanta for the metro aren't very high for homes. There were about the national average, but any areas near where the employment centers are people work and the neighborhoods that Alec mentioned they want to live, it is quite high. Atlanta has got a lot of traffic. So if you want to move, just like you can move in New York, you can move to you qualify, but it's a good distance where in before in Atlanta, it wasn't much of a distance. So again, we got a lot of our folks siphoned. So we're looking at rents in a $2 to $2.5 a foot in these areas, double what it was before a demographic that's got much higher incomes, single family situation that to us looks a lot better than it did when we left these markets a decade or a decade ago. And then again, that combines with the political risk that you and I and others have talked about on these calls for a long time. That's considerably more favorable than some of the other markets were. Yes. I missed a little of that question, but generally speaking, the rental income ratios are higher in the markets we're going into. We think that'll be offset a little bit by pretty good growth in incomes by those residents, because those areas are growing so much. I'll also say that some of the cost structures, like the fact that there's no tech taxes in Texas matter as well. So it isn't an apples to apples comparison, but the ratios in places like New York are lower than places like Atlanta. Thanks, Alex. I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? Yes, I'm sorry. Got it. Got it. I missed the first part. Yes. So the big \u2013 one of the big differences age of the property. So we're selling properties that are a lot older that have, typically have capital needs. And again, we find buyers who look at the future a little differently than we do, want to invest the value add money. So when we look at that, we're not sure you're going to get the return on that. So it ends up in a lower IRR. The properties we're buying, we just see such strong demand for that. We think that that IRR over time will exceed, the one we're seeing. As a result of a combination of higher rent growth and less CapEx. So the numbers here exciting with the cap rates going in yields. What I was referring to as the longer-term IRR. You think the IRRs are higher and what \u2013 yes, Haendel, IRRs are higher on what we're buying and what we're selling and the cap rates are the same. So one good question that we've been talking about on these calls is, are our shareholders going to miss out on some of the recovery on some of these assets we're selling, because we've talked, it's going to be pretty strong income growth in California and New York. And I'd say that there's not going to be the case because we're not selling the best assets with the best income growth. Our selling assets that have regulatory challenges or concentration issues where we own so much already in that submarket that the shareholders will get the benefit. Whereas Alec said, we just don't believe in the renovation play. So I think just again, we're selling what we believe our lower IRRs and buying higher, and we believe that's true both on the NOI side and on the net cash flow because of the CapEx. Well, first I just want to correct the beginning statement. We have a terrific existing development team. It just isn't in Atlanta. It isn't in Austin and it mostly isn't in Denver. So our development team, not as large as some of our competitors, but very capable, certainly exists that teams delivered Alcott this enormous $400 million building on time and on budget during a pandemic. So we've got a very capable team and they'll continue to focus on things. For example, our California team, we've got a lot of densification deals that we've mentioned on occasion, but you'll hear more about in the next few years. And these are deals where, for example, Haendel, we have a 300 unit deal. You take down 60 units in a garden style, structure and you put up mid-rise 200 units. Those are terrific deals for EQR those we do on our own. We don't need a partner for that. So we're open to all sorts of partnership opportunities, again, national, local, regional, you should expect that we're exploring all of those things at this point. And we're thought of as high quality partner and we're looking for a high quality counterparty. Sure. Haendel, I don't mean to be defensive. I just want to acknowledge the contribution to the team. We got a lot of people working hard, a lot of people listening to this call. As it relates to any specific party, I mean, if we were doing something I couldn't tell you, and if we're not, it wouldn't matter. So I just would say, we're out there, we're always talking to people and that's Alec's job. He has a whole team that is out there talking to developers of all shapes and sizes. Thank you. Yes. Well, thank you, everyone for your time today. Enjoy the rest of the summer and we'll see you on the conference circuit in the fall. Thank you."

            "name": "Alec Brackenridge",
            "content": "Yes, following up on that, this is Alec. Atlanta is a really robust transactions market and we have great contacts there from the past, I've worked in that market for almost 25 years now. And whether it's joint venture development or acquisitions, there's a wide range of things we can choose among. And generally the properties that we're looking at a roughly $80 million to $100 million, and what we're shooting to do over the next few years is to get to about $2 billion. So 20-ish properties, and we think we can achieve that. Austin is a smaller city. So that would be more in the $1 billion range, 10-ish properties, 10 to 12, maybe. But again, we have good feelers. We have a great team that has a lot of experience in these markets and that's what we're looking to accomplish. Hey, Jeff, this is Alec. Yes, we are considering another markets. We're selling in California right now because the bid is just so hot for it. But as that moves around the country and we think, markets like DC and New York with this improving fundamentals will also become harder investment markets and we'll list properties there. And we expect to move some property there. Hey, Brad, it's Alec. California is such a big state that I can't say that all parts of California are high. San Francisco right now has not had trades, downtown San Francisco as an example. But we have a broad portfolio and we find particularly for value add opportunities, there's just a wide, wide better pool. So that's what we're seeing in, as we've mentioned, we're selling properties are typically 18, 20 years old, and that appeals to that value add group. Well, Rich, this is Alec. I mean, buyers are optimists, right. I mean, that's why they're buying. And typically with a value add, they're pricing that in, but there's the only successful bidder right now is assuming a full recovery, or you're not going to be able to be the prevailing bid without doing that. And so that that's what we're seeing. And in terms of further out years, I really don't know per se each deal. I think everyone has their own view on long-term inflation, but what drives the cap rate in the short-term return are these either a value add, return or a return to pre-pandemic rents are plus on that. Yes. Thanks, Rich. Well, Alex, this is Alec. Very so much property by property. Some of the properties were hurt more by the pandemic. So there's more of a recovery there. Others not so much, some of them have been \u2013 because they're newer properties are coming out of lease up. So there's a burn off of concessions, that's going on. So it's hard to give a blanket statement, but we're certainly seeing far fewer concessions than any of our markets and expecting a return to the run rate of rental growth over time. Thank you. I would just add that the developers typically a really small part of the equity \u2013 overall equity, typically, 5% to 10%, we're 95% to 90%. So that's why it doesn't really change the return to us as much as you might think. Yes. So there are quite a few of those things in \u2013 Alexander, this is Alec. The change, but the primary thing that we look for in a new market is that renter, the knowledge-based industry renter, who's got a resilient job, growing income. And on that, that those numbers are up dramatically in Atlanta and certainly in Austin, but also in Denver. And that comes then with these much more vibrant urban settings that they're choosing to live in and kind of foster and be part of. And that's a big part of why, they stay in these neighborhoods longer than in the old days. And we had a lot \u2013 we had much lower rents. We had much more turnover and single family home prices were so much lower, particularly in the kind of neighborhoods that folks were living that already there was choosing to live in. So that was a big source of competition. Whereas today, in a market like Atlanta to find a affordable house, you have to go out really far. And a lot of people just don't want to make that trade off when they're been living in Midtown or Midtown West or Buckhead, they're enjoying the life that they have, and they're just less likely to move out. And that that's been a big change from where the way it was when we were there 10, 15 years ago."

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. This morning, I'll cover the changes in 2021 guidance that were included in last night's release along with a couple of quick comments on the balance sheet in capital markets. As Michael just discussed, the recovery is well underway and is exceeding our prior expectations for the same store portfolio. The continued strong operating momentum from this leasing season has led us to raise our annual same-store revenue guidance from negative 6% to negative 8% to negative 4% to negative 5%, and improvement at the midpoint of 250 basis points. Strong expense controls and favorable real estate tax outcomes, which I will talk about in a moment also allowed us to reduced our same-store expense guidance range to an increase of 2.75% to 3.25%, resulting in an NOI range of negative 7.5% to negative 8.5%, which is a 400 basis point improvement at the midpoint relative to our prior guidance. Drivers of our revenue guidance increase of 250 basis points are roughly 150 basis points of improving operating fundamentals that Michael just outlined, 60 basis points or $15 million for the full year and related lower bad debt, primarily due to anticipated rental assistance collections and the remaining 40 basis points is due to improved performance in our non-residential business. Before I move on to expenses, a quick comment on our bad debt assumptions. The back half of the year has about $10 million of additional assumed rental assistance collections, on top of the $5 million we've already received. We feel very confident about this amount, because we either received it in July or after some real digging can see that it is far along in the approval process. There are other resident accounts being worked on, but they're not as far along, given the lack of transparency and the relative slow processing speed to date, it is difficult to handicap how much will successfully get processed and whether we will receive these funds in 2021 or it'll spill over into 2022. On the expense side, we have also seen improvements versus prior expectations, which led us to center the midpoint of expense guidance at 3%, which was the low end of our prior guidance range. This reduction is in part due to the modest growth experience in Q2 2021, even with a really challenging comparable period from Q2 of 2020. While some expense categories experienced atypically high percentage growth change quarter-over-quarter due to this compatibility issue, overall expenses were less than originally anticipated. Key categories driving the current period and anticipated full year lower were real estate taxes and payroll. Reduction in growth expectations for real estate taxes is primarily driven by lower than forecasted assessed values in some key markets. Lower payroll growth expectations are primarily driven by our progress and optimizing staffing utilization as well as higher than usual staffing vacancies. We expect that 2021 will be our third consecutive year of low payroll growth, having delivered a three-year average below 1%, while keeping other controllable expenses like repairs and maintenance in check. As a result of these same-store guidance changes, we raise the midpoint of our normalized FFO from $2.75 to $2.90. A couple closing comments on the balance sheet in debt capital markets. With the impact of the pandemic on our operations increasingly in the rear view mirror, it is clear that our balance sheet has held up remarkably well. Despite, unprecedented pressure on operations, our credit metrics have remained well within our stated net debt to EBITDA leverage policy of between 5.5 times to 6.5 times. The debt capital markets are also incredibly attractive at the moment for issuers like us. This creates opportunities to term out commercial paper with treasuries and credit spreads at or near record lows. The potential of which has been incorporated into our revised guidance range. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Nick. So if you look at our disclosure in terms of our total receivables, the gross amount of receivables on the books in the same-store portfolio is about $44 million, right. So that's \u2013 and it's almost entirely reserved again. So that's really the total pie of possibility if you think about it. When you break it down kind of more granularly, we always run with $10 million, $11 million worth of receivable or bad debt. So it's probably a number that's a little bit below that. And again, so that leaves probably another five to 10 potential long run. The really hard part, as I kind of mentioned in my remarks is, just the frequency and the process associated with this. So it's a pretty long process. Michael's teams all over it, we've gotten the best transparency we could, but it does require both the resident and us to match information to get it run through the process. And then it takes a while to even after approved have the cash kind of come through the door and that's where the volatility arises in the numbers, which we wanted to highlight and be really clear about given what we have in guidance."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Equity Residential First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Martin McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. \nMartin McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2021 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release as well as a management presentation regarding our results and outlook are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report that we are seeing significant improvement in our operations, driven by continued strong demand all across our portfolio. This, in turn, allowed us to extend the gains in occupancy we discussed on the prior earnings call. We are currently 96% occupied, 160 basis point improvement since December 31, 2020. We are especially encouraged by our numbers as we enter our primary leasing season, the period of peak demand in our business and by the continuing reopening activities in our cities. The improving pricing we noted on last quarter's call has accelerated over the past few months. Pricing trend, which is a leading indicator of where market rents are going and is computed net of concessions, is up 14% this year, and we have already recovered 60% of the pricing reduction we suffered as a result of the pandemic. In fact, on a pricing trend basis, collective pricing in our markets outside of New York and San Francisco is likely to recover completely by the end of May. The New York and San Francisco markets declined by more than our other markets, so they have further to go to regain pre-pandemic pricing, but momentum is strong in those two markets, and they are making good progress towards full recovery. To provide additional color on our operating trends, we posted to our website at equityapartments.com, a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations. After I give a quick overview of guidance changes and investment activities, Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide more detail on our current performance and forward trajectory. After that, we'll take your questions. The encouraging trends, I just mentioned, led us to raise our guidance ranges for physical occupancy, same-store revenue, same-store net operating income and normalized funds from operations as disclosed in last night's release. The midpoint of our same-store revenue range was raised 100 basis points to negative 7%, the midpoint of our NOI range was raised 150 basis points to negative 12% and the midpoint of our NFFO range was raised by $0.05 to $2.75 per share. These improvements were almost entirely driven by stronger and earlier than anticipated recovery trends in both our residential and non-residential operations across all our markets. We are well positioned heading into our prime leasing season, but our reported same-store revenue numbers will lag the recovery in our operating statistics as we work through the impact of lower rents and of concessions. In terms of the first quarter's numbers, the impact of the pandemic is readily apparent. We said previously that our reported same-store revenue numbers would get worse before they get better, and that's exactly what happened. Same-store revenues declined 10.5% for the quarter, which, while it was a bit better than we expected, is still among the worst revenue numbers in our history. We believe that our first quarter results will be our low point for the year and that they will improve from this point on. Turning to investments. While no dispositions or acquisitions closed this quarter, we have been active in the transaction market, and we expect to have a considerable amount of activity to report on next quarter. As we've said on prior calls, in order to create the most stable, growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are broadening our portfolio over time to increase our exposure to suburban properties in our existing markets, where the resident demographic is similar to our existing affluent urban resident population. We are also working on increasing our investment in Denver and continuing to consider a select number of new markets, that have large and growing affluent resident bases, favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and lower political risk. While asset prices are high in the locations in which we seek to invest, our funding source for these acquisitions comes from sales of existing properties, especially in California, where we are obtaining pricing that exceeds our pre-pandemic valuations. We expect to complete this transaction activity with minimal dilution and to stay consistent with our strategy of acquiring newer assets with modest capital expenditure burdens. The one piece of notable investment activity that did occur in the quarter was our $5 million investment and a fund that preserves affordable housing across our country. This for profit fund is run by long time experts in the affordable housing preservation and finance area. Using our equity capital and that of other investors as well as government financing, the fund acquires and improves the quality of existing affordable housing communities that would otherwise be at risk of either physical neglect or where the affordable restrictions are about to expire. We have been clear on prior calls of our steadfast opposition to rent control and other short-sighted policies that do not help solve the affordable housing shortage. Economists consistently say that rent control, in fact, leads to disinvestment in existing housing and impedes the creation of new housing. We support solution-focused investment like this fund that preserve or create affordable housing and favor the elimination of overly restrictive zoning codes that limit housing production where it's needed most. Along with ongoing engagement with public officials in our markets, this investment demonstrates our commitment to being part of the solution with respect to the affordable housing gap. To sum up, we are encouraged by the progress being made on vaccinations as well as the reopening of cities. Recent announcements made by employers, particularly in the tech industry regarding return to office are welcome news. We believe that the new operating model for most companies will be a hybrid of in-office and work from home and that our portfolio will benefit from workers looking to live close to the office. The unique cultural and entertainment options that are becoming available again, as cities reopen, are also magnets to our affluent renter demographic, and will draw them back to the cities and to the lifestyle, many of them crave. Our customer base has stayed well employed during the pandemic and can afford our current rents and absorb future rent increases as market conditions improve. 2021 is indeed turning out to be a year of recovery for our company. As we have said before, equity residential same-store revenue growth coming out of recessions has typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other economic conditions remain supportive. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to thank all of our investors for their continued support during these challenging times. We are well positioned to benefit from a return to normal as the pandemic subsides. We are optimistic about the future of our business and believe that our portfolio will thrive. I'll now turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael?\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark. So with the first quarter now in the books and our spring leasing season ramping up, we continue to see strong performance build upon the early indicators we were seeing on our last call. The accelerated distribution of the vaccines have clearly had an impact on many of the states and cities where we operate as they push for return to a more normal environment. Our teams in our various markets are sharing positive news of neighborhoods that are starting to feel alive again as more and more companies get ready to reopen offices. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of work-from-home, we see our demographic is drawn to the amazing culture, food and art that our urban locations offer. They're excited about reopening of these experiences and feel a sense of urgency to return, especially knowing that these lower rents won't last for long. As you may remember from prior calls, we have focused our approach on maximizing revenues by balancing occupancy with rate and concessions, which has proved successful thus far. Our confidence in the recoveries of our cities, coupled with this disciplined approach, kept us from overreacting in one direction or the other and we are well positioned as the recovery takes off to sell our excess inventory at net effective rates that are currently 14% higher than the end of last year. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overall trends. So first, demand. Demand was strong through both the winter season and early spring with a continued trend of increased applications and move-in activity that is well above seasonal norms and has fueled a stronger-than-expected occupancy recovery. Occupancy is currently 96%. And as of two weeks ago, is now above the prior year comp period. And for the first time, beginning to approach 2019 levels. This occupancy strength is contributing to the improvement in our revenue growth recovery. Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions and is a good indicator of where market rents are headed, has improved across all markets during the first quarter and through April. We continue to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. In January, concessions averaged just under six weeks on about 1/3 of our applications. By March and into April, this has been reduced to about 20% of applications receiving on average four weeks, and we expect this to continue to decline into May. As stated in the management presentation, we have seen a 14% improvement in pricing trend from December 31 to April 23. Renewal rate negotiation pressure continues as we renew residents who signed leases at the onset of the pandemic before the declines and pricing trends occurred. Outside of Southern California and Denver, our other markets have pricing trend below prior year, which put pressure on renewal negotiations. This situation is improving weekly. And as Mark mentioned, we expect the other markets, excluding New York and San Francisco, to be positive by the end of May. April renewal rate achieved should be 200 basis points better than March, which was a negative 4.5%. The percent of residents renewing also continues to improve, with March and April, both achieving above 55%. These levels remain below our historical average for this time of year, but the gap is closing. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved continue to improve with sequential improvement in new lease change expected for the next several quarters. As previously discussed, renewal rate achieved was pressured in Q1, but the pressure will continue to moderate as pricing trend improves and as the rate on expiring leases which were written pre and early onset in the pandemic narrows with current market rents. On pages six through eight of our management presentation, we have provided color on pricing trends, physical occupancy, percent of residents renewing and leasing concessions for each market. So I will not repeat that here. But let me provide some brief market-specific commentary. I will start in Boston, where we are seeing an uptick in interest from students as many colleges have announced plans for campuses to open again in the fall. We may well benefit from limits on dorm occupancies as some students will need to find alternative housing. This market will face some headwinds from new supply, particularly in the city, where we are still dealing with some non-stabilized lease-ups from last year as well as a few new deals expected to deliver in the back half of 2021. New York is starting to see positive momentum. Demand is good, driven by both bargain hunters looking to upgrade and people returning to Manhattan in anticipation of office reopenings. Specifics around office re-openings remain unclear, but indications are that it will be a hybrid that has employees back in the office, at least part of the week by summer and early fall. In New York, concessions remain part of the marketing strategy, even while we are raising rates. This market held on to widespread concession use through most of the first quarter, but the last several weeks has shown concession use starting to decline. Unlike any of our other markets, New York has a more significant number of local operators not on yield management, who tend to use concessions more frequently. New supply is basically nonexistent in Manhattan, however, supply pressure on the Hudson Waterfront in New Jersey in the back half of this year may impact that submarket. Our migration data suggests that this market is beginning to return to normal as applications from outside the New York MSA and move-outs leaving the MSA, both continue to trend closer to normal pre-pandemic levels. Turning to D.C. During the pandemic, physical occupancy held up better in D.C. than any of our other East Coast markets. Absorption of new supply also has generally remained healthy that has slowed compared to 2019 levels. While demand in this market remains robust, we are facing some headwinds from new supply in 2021. D.C. has an excellent track record of absorbing new supply, but with more than 12,000 units being delivered this year, that track record will be challenged. Heading to the West Coast. Seattle trends are moving in the right direction, but the market has shown periods of price resistance. Tech companies continue to hire and are moving towards reopening offices. Amazon's recent announcement of its commitment to an office centric culture as their baseline is a very good sign for driving demand. The expiration of the H1B visa ban at the end of March should also be a good driver of demand as the tech sector was heavily reliant on this program for talent. On the supply front, new supply deliveries will rebound in 2021 with the largest concentration in the CBD down town submarket. San Francisco, one of the markets hardest hit by the pandemic is clearly on the road to recovery. Concession use in this market has shown a meaningful decline. Our communities located in the city of San Francisco are starting to feel vibrant again. Late in the first quarter, we saw a flurry of announcements from Bay Area tech firms with regards to return to office. Many of the tech firms, including Google, are taking a firmer than expected stance with regards to office attendance, as they recognize the importance of in-person work in both product creation and company culture. Schools are reopening with colleges planning for students to return to campus in the fall, and demand for our two and three bedrooms has clearly increased in the last several weeks. New supply will be elevated in 2021 with a large concentration in the South Bay, which may create some pricing headwinds for us. Southern California has been the strongest part of our portfolio during the pandemic. Los Angeles, despite being one of the most lockdown cities in the country, continues to have good demand. The city is opening back up, and the governor has set mid-June for a full reopening. The most encouraging sign in this market is the pickup in activity in the content creation sector. Television and movies that were filming in other states during the pandemic are returning to LA. 2021 new supply deliveries will be well spread out across the submarkets, with most of the expected pressure coming to us in the Mid-Wilshire, Koreatown submarket. Orange County and San Diego continue to be the real standouts in terms of performance. These markets have the highest occupancies and the best, albeit still negative, revenue performance. But we see same-store revenue growth in these markets turning positive in the second quarter. These markets should continue to benefit as the state opens back up, and travel and leisure activity picks up. New supply will be at normal levels and generally well spread out across the submarkets. While Southern California is generally one of our better performing areas, it has and continues to experience the highest levels of delinquency. We have mobilized our teams to assist our residents in applying for available federal rental assistance dollars, while California was ahead of most states in creating a rental assistant application process. The state is just beginning to process applications and to send out money. We will be aggressive in pursuing these California relief funds as well as other programs throughout the country. Finally, in Denver, demand remained strong across the market, although pricing pressure and widespread concession use is common downtown. Our two suburban Denver properties have little concession use and are seeing good demand and revenue growth, new supply will be elevated from 2020 levels, but good job growth should be a driver of the absorption of that supply. Across all of our markets, our focus will remain on increasing rates and continuing to reduce and eliminate concessions, our strategy of not chasing occupancy at any cost during the winter is paying off. So far, we have been able to grow our occupancy, while at the same time, recovering just over 60% of the decline in rate that we experienced from March to December of 2020. We believe that this approach will continue to benefit us as we move forward through 2021 and close that gap. Let me close by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. I am confident that we have the best team in the industry, and they are demonstrating the power of working together as they lead the markets through the recovery phase and remain relentless in serving our customers and taking care of each other. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: I appreciate all the additional operating disclosure. As you look at the pricing trends in the management presentation, and they're approaching last year's growth, at least in April. So then you look at blended rate in April, still down 7.2%. How do you marry those two things together? I know you talked some on the renewals. But how would you expect signed new leases to trend over the next few months?\nMichael Manelis: Nick, this is Michael. So I think the way to think about this is pricing trend from Page five in that management presentation is the leading indicator of where the improvement is going to come to blended rate. And then after you see the improvement in blended rate, you start to see the improvement in revenue growth. So I think there's probably about a month or two lag that you start to see as we'll start to cross over. Now remember, the comp period from last year gets easier as we work our way through May and June. So our focus is really around that pre-pandemic period, which is what were rents like in each one of these assets at the very beginning of March 2020, and where we have good acceleration, we're focused on what was that high mark from '19 and how fast can we go after that. So I think as we keep pushing forward and keep getting that momentum over prior year, you'll start to see that blended rate improvement really kick into gear. You could see what happened just sequentially from March to April. I would expect you're going to see that same kind of real big pop as you work your way, April into May.\nNick Joseph: That's very helpful. And then, Mark, you mentioned the considerable amount of activity. I was just wondering if you can give more details on that expected external growth and the size and cadence of the deal?\nMark Parrell: Nick, well, just to be clear, the growth is really a swap, right? We're selling assets, as I mentioned in my remarks, predominantly in California, but also elsewhere. Getting really terrific pricing on that stuff and being able to trade into properties in Denver, for example, where we're going to expand our presence, we think, pretty significantly over the next few quarters. We continue to look at some new markets. And then again, suburban parts of our existing markets. So again, we'll have better detail. I actually have properties to speak to, but we're well along in that process. I expect to have a bunch close in the next month or two, and then to be able to talk about it in more detail in July.\nNick Joseph: Thanks.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Maybe a follow-up on that, Mark. We'll wait a few months to hear about actual deals. But just in terms of the private market pricing you're seeing evolve in these markets, which metropolitan areas do you think been the cheapest right now in terms of going in pricing? And which markets do you think pricing is the most irrational?\nMark Parrell: Great question. So I'm going to look at cap rates, talk a little bit about cap rates with you, though we all know that's only part of the picture. A lot of these markets, almost all of them that we're either in or interested in with the exception of Manhattan, Brooklyn and call it, the city of San Francisco are trading at or higher than they did at the pandemic period. So we were looking at cap rates, for example, in Denver, 3.75% to 4.25%. I mean there isn't a market that's screening cheap. And in terms of expensive, I'd say the recovery is well-priced in. It's probably a charitable way to say it. I think these cap rates are low because people have confidence because even in the Sun Belt markets or places like Denver, there were declines in revenue. And I think what people are seeing is you're going to make that up, and you're going to make that up pretty quickly. And so they're willing to kind of capitalize that into the price. So with the NOI is still relatively low, that makes the cap rates low. So I guess I'd say there aren't any bargains we see. But what works for us is if we can sell some of these assets that whether it's locational or we have an over-concentration. We're able to get rid of, John, at pretty low cap rates, too at values in a lot of cases that are the highest, not just the pandemic, but we've ever seen and buy assets we really like at the same cap rates, even if they are, frankly, in the very low fours and in the threes, that's still a good trade for us. We still think that gives us that diversification we talk about, maybe a little better growth going forward. Again, we're always looking at newer assets, so we're not arbitraging new properties for old. We're typically buying in our markets. And in Denver, for example, assets that are 2016 vintage or newer.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Understood. Makes sense. Final question, maybe when you stare out -- either for Mark or Michael, when you stare out a few years beyond this initial snapback in rate and occupancy in your markets, which markets do you think are well positioned for kind of a nice multiyear run in rent growth? And which markets are you concerned, kind of hit a wall compared to how - these next few years?\nMark Parrell: Well, let me start there. Michael may have something to add in there, John. But maybe we'll talk about the whole company for a second, and then we'll go to the market's question because we have been noodling on that a little. We're certainly not in a position to give '22 or '23 guidance. But I think when you look at how this company performed, Equity Residential perform coming out of recessions and thinking back to the tech bust in the 2002 vintage period and great financial crisis in '09. You've had a couple of years of negative growth. And then you've had kind of an in-between year, a transition year where we were right at zero for same-store revenue. And then you've had that snapback that you're referring to, where we're averaging 5% for three or more years of same-store revenue growth. What I think is different this time or is likely to be, first off, the decline was much larger. Absolutely. Both last year and this year, larger than the order of magnitude in those two prior cases. But I think we're going to skip the transition year and go straight, given the velocity, Michael is speaking of. We're going to go straight to a number that's considerably higher than that sort of transitional zero to de minimis same-store revenue growth. When you look by market, one market I was thinking a bit about before the call was New York. And we certainly hear a lot about New York and that kicked around a little bit. But when you look at the numbers after the great financial crisis, they had a couple of years. They had quarters where the numbers were 7% quarter-over-quarter. And I'd remind everyone that simply removing concessions is an 8% increase for a given lease in revenue year-over-year. So I think New York will put up some pretty good numbers, but in fairness, that's based on some pretty big declines. And I think the same is true for San Francisco. I think we've got a lot of confidence in Southern California. I think that market is doing very well. I think Seattle has been a little uneven. So I'll let Michael maybe comment on that. A lot of confidence in Boston, the recovery has been great in that market. There's a lot of good things happening in Boston. And again, in D.C., and we haven't talked about it in a while, but we're still going to have Amazon's HQ2 coming, and that's very close to numerous of our assets. So I feel like when I look at the markets, San Francisco and New York might post very significant quarter-over-quarter year-over-year numbers. But in fairness, that has to be judged by the level of decline that occurred the last few years. But when you just do compound numbers, I think Southern Cal is going to feel good. I think Boston is going to have a really nice recovery and come out of this more quickly than any place else. And I guess I'll defer to you, Michael, as you think about Seattle, because I just don't know how to think about that?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Well, so I think near term, I think I said in the prepared remarks, it's had these moments of kind of fits and stops as our recovery goes. But if I would go a little bit further out, longer term, I mean, the demand drivers are strong in all of our markets. So as you really think about our ability to kind of grow revenue across our markets, all of these markets have unique aspects of what's going to be really delivering that demand growth. And I feel positive about really our opportunity as we work our way forward. We've still got this near-term stuff. We've got to work our way through, but the momentum is on our side right now.\nMark Parrell: Just - and I'm sorry to supplement further, maybe just a conversation about Denver, and this is just as applicable to Austin. I mean, a lot of the per square foot rents in those markets are $2 to $2.20 a foot per month. When you look at other markets that we think Denver will emulate like Seattle, there's a lot of room to run. I mean -- and when you look at single-family, and I was just out there with our Chief Investment Officer a few weeks ago in Denver, great quality of life, a lot of good things to say about job quality and lifestyle in Denver, but also single-family has gotten a lot more expensive. I mean, townhouse is that routinely are $600,000, nice homes but not elaborate. And again, our rents at that level compete well. And I feel like you could see some real out-performance for higher-end apartments in places like Denver and presumably places like Austin, the issue is that the market is pricing that in. And that cap rates are pretty darn low. But again, if we're trading out of assets we don't want, and it's at the same cap rate, and we're buying a better kind of growth stream, we think that math is going to work out for us.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for all the comments and for the time.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, John.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Rich Hightower with Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks again for all the\u2026\nMark Parrell: Good morning.\nRich Hightower: Operational detail, good morning. So just to think about the charts in the investor deck from last night, New York and San Francisco. And as we think about sort of the interplay between occupancy and net effective rents. And Michael, I think you touched on this a little bit in your prepared comments. But is there a chance or is something you're forecasting where maybe rents level off a little bit as you play more catch up in occupancy in those markets specifically over the next few months?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I think I would say that the occupancy is catching up and that trajectory moves. Our focus really in both of those markets is to continue to claw back as much of this decline as we can, given the strength and demand we're seeing. We still got ways to go. If you isolate like Downtown, San Francisco to the nine properties or 2,500 units we have. We're still materially off from where we were at this time last year. The good news in that market is concessions have really abated. So now we have an opportunity just to grow that face rent. The opposite opportunity exists in New York right now, whereas concessions held down strong, and now our focus is let's keep trying to pull back those concessions. Even while concessions maintain that high level in the first quarter, we were trying to pressure test just raising up rate. So we have this a different opportunity in both of these markets to really go forward. So I wouldn't say it's -- let's pause occupancy and claw back all the rate or let's keep rates where they are and get all the occupancy. It's this constant push on both levers.\nRich Hightower: Okay. That makes sense. And then just in terms of the sort of the return to office wave, obviously, that's a big contributor to demand, whether that's happening now or maybe later this summer, it's causing demand to increase in a lot of the sort of the urban core submarkets. Are there any trends that we can -- or that you're gleaning from your portfolio in terms of who's moving in and whether that's by price point or unit mix or maybe the different neighborhoods? Are there any kind of interesting takeaways from some of those data?\nMark Parrell: Sure. Well, I will tell you, I think on the past calls, I talked about the pressure we were having with studios and just not seeing a lot of demand for new leases there. That clearly is changing as we work our way through that first quarter and through April, just sequentially, from our point of April 23 to the end of that first quarter. We've improved 150 basis points in our occupancy of studios. So we're not back all the way where we were, but we're clearly starting to see that demand. And that's really an interesting standpoint because we're not seeing as much of the acceleration in the rate recovery on studios yet. So you're still seeing that attractive price point and that leads to that next demographic piece just from the overall affordability and like the household income. So what we've done is we're really focused right now in new residents that moved in with us during the first quarter. What do we know about them? So first, from the overall age profile and demographic, really pretty much in line with our historical average. Those move-ins had 33 -- they were 33 years old. It's a little bit less in like in New York market where we were 33.5. But historically, we were up in like a 35-year old, kind of moving in. So not a big change on the age. On the affordability index, which is really rent as a percent of income, we really saw no significant change across any of our markets. The portfolio is still averaging at 19%. So rent as a percent of income is 19%. When you drill into that because rates are still down, that means what gave is a little bit of a decline in the annual household income for our new residents moving in. It's just not a significant number, though. These are still affluent renters that are moving in with us. The most significant decline came in New York. But our average renters for Q1 household income was $215,000 in that market, and their rent to income ratio is still at 18.5%. So we've been kind of watching these demographic trends to see what's happening. The pattern of going after the larger units, the one and two bedrooms, we talked about on the last call, still there. We're well occupied on that front. Now the opportunity is studios.\nRich Hightower: Okay, great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. Good morning. One follow-up on that - the last discussion around demographics. Specifically, New York City and San Francisco, can you discuss a little bit more on who's returning, who's entering the portfolio? Any color on that to give us?\nMark Parrell: Sure. So I think by that, we'll just -- we'll talk about what we say is like our migration patterns. So like where are people coming to us from the new residents as well as when we look where are our residents that are leaving going. And I will tell you in San Francisco, we're trending back towards normal pre-pandemic levels, but applications from within the same MSA and state, both still remain elevated. Huge improvement sequentially from what we saw in the Q3 and Q4 period of last year, but they're both still slightly elevated, which really just means that you're still seeing kind of this deal seeker or people trying to take advantage of it just moving within the market. The New York front has really almost returned back to normal. It still has some elevated level of deal seekers from within the same MSA. But really, that is materially lower. We were up in like 80% of all of our applications in New York were coming to us from within the same MSA. Right now, we're back down to 65%, which is right in line with our historical norms.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. Very interesting. And then second, on renewal rates, I know you made comments on markets outside San Fran and New York. It should return positive by May. I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you provide a forecast for San Fran and New York? When do you expect renewal rates to stabilize or also turn positive?\nMichael Manelis: That's a great question. So I think a lot still depends upon our ability to grow that pricing trend over the prior year and really back to that pre-pandemic level. So I would think I would look at this somewhere in -- we have an opportunity in the late second quarter, early third quarter to do it if that momentum stays. But I could also just see that number kind of moving out a few more months. If we kind of hit any section of pause in our ability to keep recovering and clawing back that rate.\nJeff Spector: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler has our next question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey. Guys, good morning. Two questions. First, Mark, as you were talking about the sort of the markets or sort of the change in the demographics of people moving in. Is your view simply that based on the commentary of the income levels that you're seeing? I'm really talking about San Francisco and New York because it sounds like the other markets are doing much better. Is your view that if you remove the concessions that the new renter profile can afford the standard face rents? Or is your view that it's going to be a slow trickle of easing back into the historic face rents that, let's say, we were at in 2019?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I mean, I think from an affordability index, it's clear that the new residents moving in are going to be able to afford increases as we return to those pre-pandemic levels. As we've been pulling back even sequentially into April and as we think about where we sit today, even from last weeks, kind of applications coming in, we're pushing really hard, and we're not finding that resistance point yet. I mean, that's our goal, is to keep pushing and trying to find that resistance point. We haven't seen a change in the demographic profile. So I think from an affordability standpoint, the applicants coming in, they're all approved based on the gross rent. So regardless of concessions, they're approved on that gross rent and they're used to paying us that gross rent after they get past that first or second month. So I think that's something we'll have to watch in the markets where we -- like New York and San Fran, where we really kind of have momentum to dial back even more on that concession use. But to date, for the month of April, we have not seen any material change in that demographic.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So if I understood you correctly, all the tenants are approved based on their ability to pay the non-concessionary rent, the full-face rent, is that correct?\nMichael Manelis: That is correct. That is correct.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. That's actually pretty big. So it's on the total rent, not the effective rent. Okay. It's interesting. Mark, it wouldn't be a conference call without rent control discussion. I see that Albany is still kicking around a good cause eviction potential for basically rent control in New York. You didn't mention it in the light of asset of markets that you would sell down. But given that New Jersey and Connecticut are -- don't seem to be in that same vein, would you have a view of selling down your New York and Manhattan exposure and increasing New Jersey and Connecticut?\nMark Parrell: So you're going to ruin all the news for next quarter, but we did sell our last asset in Connecticut, and that was really an asset decision. It just wasn't a property that we thought had the renovation potential that the buyer did. So it's just a little bit of an older property, Alex. We are interested in a deal and will likely close shortly that is a New Jersey higher end affluent renter base. You can certainly commute into Manhattan, but there's a lot of folks that live at this property that are going to work in that area. So we are open. Again, New York has -- the New York metro has some huge advantages in terms of supply dynamics, in terms of having the largest base of high income rentership in the country by a long shot. I think you can say whatever we all might say about this President and the prior President's actions. But as it relates to infrastructure, and spending and things that the city of New York, the state of New York and the states around it needed. A lot of money is coming into these states to heal, so we're still open very much to investing in the greater metro area in New York.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. But it sounds like you may be open to further selling down your direct New York exposure. Is that fair to say?\nMark Parrell: That's fair to say. We have 27 buildings in Brooklyn and Manhattan. I can't tell you how many we'll have in two years, but it will be somewhat less. And I think that we've got some of that 421a stuff, you might remember that we've spoken of, that's just hard for public reporting company to own. And I just think we're probably just a little over concentrated in Manhattan. And you may just see a slight net. But again, you'll see us find deals that we like in the metro area, and we'll buy those. We got a development deal in the New York metro area as well that we'll talk about next quarter or the quarter after. So I think we're willing to do both, Alex. But this trend of spreading out our capital is true in every market, and that definitely includes New York. And I think New York net will be smaller than metro.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Cool. Thank you, Mark.\nMark Parrell: Thank you. Appreciate, Alex.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: Hey. Good morning, guys. I want to go back to maybe comment or question Nick was talking about at the beginning. And thank you very much for the additional disclosures. I recognize Marty might feel differently about putting it together, but we certainly enjoy it. As you think about pricing trends, the slide on Page five talks about all of your markets. I'm struck by how all Orange County and San Diego have done well above pre-COVID markets. Denver is starting up fairly well. So as you think about the ability to push before return to work, let's use New York as an example, it seems like given the demand that you're seeing from people optimistically moving back to major markets like New York City, there's still healthy room for you to push that. Is that the right way to think about it?\nMichael Manelis: Yes, absolutely. You could just look at the slope. I mean, I would say we have been pushing. If you just look at the slope of the line, that's occurred. But our goal is to keep being as aggressive as we can, while we have that demand kind of coming in that front door.\nRich Hill: Got it. And so as we think about these pricing trends, given the NOI contribution coming from markets like New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, you could actually see those -- that pricing trend go well above where it was this time last year for a variety of different reasons, but primarily due to mix. Is that a right way to think about how that pricing trend might look like in 2Q or 3Q, assume that you put this slide in your deck again?\nMark Parrell: Well, it's Mark. I just want to make sure we're answering the right question for you. When you start comparing price trend, for example, in July of 2020 in any of those markets, the pricing trend in July of '21. Because '20 kept going down in '21, we believe and hope and feel is going to keep going up, those numbers will cross and relatively soon. So we're trying to be careful. We're certainly happy that we're improving, and we see that as an absolute. But pretty soon, it won't be relevant to judge us against 2020 anymore. It's when do we get back to pre-pandemic 2019, early, early 2020, and we're making progress towards that. So to answer your question, yes, that will probably happen and those lines will cross. That's partly because we do feel like we can keep pushing pricing trend, that's partly because it went down so hard in 2020 in fairness. But I think you're going to see us talk more and more if things keep going this well about how and when we'll get back to late 2019, early, early 2020 type of pricing. Is that helpful?\nRich Hill: That's absolutely helpful. And that leads me to my next question, if I can, which is the forward outlook. Obviously, the market wasn't weak in 2019 prior to COVID. But is there a scenario where you can actually really begin to push rents pretty heavily. Once you normalize back to 2019 levels, given a combination of strength that you're seeing in the already strong markets. But also on millennial and Z generation, that should create a heavy demand in urban markets?\nMark Parrell: We certainly hope so. I mean, you're starting to ask a question that's more applicable probably to 2022. But again, we've all read the articles. Yes. We all read the -- I mean the setup is good. You got great occupancy. I mean, New York, in just a few weeks, will open up to 75% occupancy in office space. And we're seeing these numbers so strong. And legally, it's not open for more than 50% occupancy, that feels terrific to us. And again, we've all read about what happened after the 2019 or whatever it was Spanish-flu epidemic. There was a lot of pent-up demand for all sorts of things. And I think we'll see that. I think people want a little more space. Young people have been stuck at home with their parents. My kids included, one out, and they want to live where we own properties. And I think we're going to feel all of that, which is your Gen-Z comment. So I think we've got a good long runway here ahead of us as we get through this year, put the pain of 2020 behind us as a company and as a society. I think you're going to see some pretty good numbers from folks like us, apartment owners in these big cities.\nRich Hill: Yes. Thanks, guys. I was indeed asking a question about '22. I'm just trying to think about once we get -- once we get back the inflection in the second half of '21 and the first half of '22, which feels very real to us. What do we look like going forward. But that's quite helpful guys.\nMark Parrell: Well, that was shifty of you. But I mean, I'd just tell you, obviously, progress in the pandemic has to continue. Like I said in my remarks, economic conditions have remain generally supportive, but there's good momentum. The single-family market is very expensive still. I do understand all the return to office, work remote arguments, but I think there's still a very large constituency happy to live in our urban locations.\nRich Hill: Thanks, guys.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Good morning. Question on concessions. So in New York, you mentioned that 55% did not receive a concession and 45% got six weeks on average. What's the difference between the haves and have not? Is that a neighborhood discrepancy or price point?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I think it's a little bit of both. So clearly, we have some markets like the Upper-West side and Upper-East side, where we really have pulled back using concessions. You still have submarkets like Chelsea and Gramercy that you still see concessions are being used widespread across most of the applications. So I think at this point, we've seen momentum in the last three weeks, even in those tougher hit areas. So we're going to just keep opening. We could keep pulling back and dialing back not only the value of the concession. But just how frequently they are. The other thing you got to remember with the use of concessions is many times, what we're doing right now is we'll have concessions in place on vacant units to create the sense of urgency to fill our vacancy, and we will not offer concessions on noticed units, which is residents that said they're moving out somewhere at the end of May or into June. We'll advertise those units for sale, but we will not have concessions on them, and we are leasing those units without concessions.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And then how long do you think it will take to reduce the concessions back to pre-pandemic levels? Is it going to be more likely more than one lease cycle?\nMichael Manelis: I think that's too early to tell, right? You could see the momentum in like a San Francisco, Downtown San Francisco, how fast you can pull back? So I think New York, or the Manhattan submarkets clearly have the opportunity to just pull back at the same pace. They haven't done that yet. And I think a lot of that does have to do with the type of ownership we have. Where you have a lot of kind of single-owned assets that aren't using yield management, and they're going to keep those specials in place until they fill back up, and then they'll eliminate the concession. So I think that's still TBD as to when we'll get back to a place where we're normalized on the concession use in that market.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And then, Mark, you mentioned that the portfolio repositioning this year will have minimal impact to earnings this year. But do you see this new market concentration providing more earnings growth potential? Or is the benefit really diversification and stability going forward?\nMark Parrell: A little bit of both. When you think about growth, as I said in some of my prior answers, it's likely that New York and San Francisco will post absolute numbers that are somewhat higher in the near term, let's call it, so maybe '22, '23-ish periods. Just again, because the decline, John, was so significant before, I think when you start to talk about a longer period of time, it's probably good to have a little bit of a -- to be in a few of these growth markets and be a little bit spread out. So -- and I also just think diversification of all sorts is good. I mean, listen, we've talked a lot about political risk in some of our markets, but I'd point out, if you own departments in Texas, you probably have some pretty significant casualty and maintenance issues to deal with from the freeze. So there is no place that's riskless from physical point of view or riskless from political issues or whatever. So just having the capital in us being in 6, seven markets, it's probably better to 10 or 11, but I don't see us going back to 30 like we were in the late '90s. That's not -- that's too many to keep, I think, good track of and to be on top of.\nJohn Kim: Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Amanda Sweitzer with Baird has our next question.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. Can you guys provide an update on your ancillary income trends? And do you have pricing power to implement some of those fees today? And any thought to bring in more short-term rentals?\nMichael Manelis: So the short-term rentals, I would say, at this point, we're not doing that. We see enough demand for conventional renters. So we're going to kind of hold off on going back to that type of renter. And as far as the ancillary income, I think we're still being aggressive where we can with all of our amenity fees, whether that's raising the parking. I mean, we spend a lot of time over the course of the last couple of years, improving kind of how we priced our parking spaces and how we kind of optimize the revenue from that. So I think there's still a little bit of opportunity left, but not a lot there. And then the other thing that feeds into some of those ancillary incomes is just our settlement fee. So when people break leases, what are the fees we charged. We clearly have increased those throughout the COVID period, we'll keep them at this elevated level. And then the other areas that we have right now, I would say we had some things in place pre-COVID that we're just not ready to go back to yet.\nAmanda Sweitzer: That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, have you given any thought to re-purposing some of your existing commercial space? And if you have -- I mean, what uses a pure interest and any prospective ROIs on those conversions?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Amanda, it's Mark. So we have given some thought. We've talked on prior calls a little bit about that. So again, this would mostly be for our current residents. Our thought isn't to compete with those sort of rework type remote work providers. It's more to provide an amenity to our residents that they're either paying for directly on a per use basis, maybe it's repurposed ground floor retail that we put a great Internet hub in and some furniture and then off to the races or maybe it's just space and existing amenities that we're bifurcating a little bit more so people can use it. So I don't really have an ROI for you as much as its stickiness. And I'll say that one thing we don't want to do is just hold on an empty retail for too long, assuming we can get cities to let us rezone it. We do have retail space that was vacated, and we're just giving a lot of thoughtfulness to whether we're just going to put new retail tenants in that space. And then you haven't forbid 2, 3, four years later, go through the same experience again. Because retail is a tough business. We're glad we have very little of it. So we may repurpose some of that additional space as potentially amenity space for our residents. But you shouldn't expect us to use it significantly as an independent rental stream.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Makes sense. Appreciate the time.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Its Haendel. Thank you. Good morning. So I was curious, maybe you guys can talk a bit about the outlook for bad debt in the portfolio given the recent extension of the Eviction Moratorium? And how that plays into your same-store revenue picture for your California and overall portfolio? And what's reflected in the guide?\nRobert Garechana: Yes. No problem, Haendel, it's Bob. So from a bad debt perspective, not a lot has changed. And you kind of saw that in the reported numbers from -- sequentially from Q4 to Q1. They're relatively flat. And that's what we assumed in our guidance is that they kind of stay the same. We do not assume any kind of material level of improvement. That's, obviously, a potential green shoot. We are very active in the process of working with our residents as it relates to some of these federal rental assistance programs. And that's particularly concentrated, as you kind of alluded to in Southern California, where we have experienced the most elevated amount of bad debt. And so that's a possibility, but is not incorporated into the numbers themselves. So for now, our best guess is just assuming that things stay the same throughout 2021.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. And maybe, I guess, can you talk a bit about, if your funding thoughts for potential acquisitions has changed at all, given the continued improvement of your cost of equity. I know that the plan this year was to be -- to use proceeds from dispositions to buy. But just curious say if there's been any shift in thinking about perhaps being more of a net acquirer given the improvement of cost of capital? And then also as part of that, maybe you could talk about your plan to get bigger in Denver and Austin, if development will play a role in that in your overall income development here?\nMark Parrell: Well, it's Mark. Thanks for that question, Haendel. Those are a little bit linked because the one thing we can't do with recycling is development. So if the 1031 rule's continue to be in effect, it's pretty efficient for us because we do have assets we want to exit in markets where we want to lower exposure to do -- use a -- do a tax-free exchange and then just move the money over. I would say on development, that's an area where in the past, we have used the ATM or have used other mechanisms to raise money because you can't 1031 into developments. You really need to have independent capital. Often, it's been pretty small. So we've used debt capital. But again, as our cost of equity improves here and as our -- it becomes a more relevant funding source, I'm open to it. Another way, by the way, to address our market concentration, our desire to rebalance is to make the whole company bigger. So you could use, again, ATMs and issuances to buy assets and not recycle. But as long as the 1031 -- and buy assets, I'm sorry, in new markets or in Denver, for example. But that's a process that could have more dilution associated with it. So I just want to be kind of thoughtful about it.\nHaendel St. Juste: That is helpful. And one question, one last one for me. Maybe you can help me understand something a bit better. The commentary about reinvesting your -- well, potentially disposition proceeds from California into places like Denver, but accretively on an IRR basis. I'm just struggling to reconcile the math here a bit. If cap rates in Denver and California are both in the, call it, low 4%, maybe sub 4% range. But rents across much of California is still sitting below - well below prior levels, while Denver is already looks like it's past it. I guess I understand the lower CapEx, certainly, but how the IRR -- is that different or even better in a place like Denver with cap rates already pretty low. So maybe you could help me understand what I might be missing here as you think about the reallocation of capital from California to a place like Denver? Thanks.\nMark Parrell: I think you're asking a very fair question. I think you're starting at about the same place as you suggested. I think the assets we're selling often do have significant capital that needs to be invested. And I appreciate that's more of an AFFO thing than an FFO thing. But as you know, we think a lot about CapEx at EQR. And so in a lot of these cases, we're buying new product in Denver, and we're selling old product in California. And so I think the shareholders are much better off on an AFFO basis. I'll also say, again, when we're in Denver, looking at $2 to $2.20 a foot rents per month in a place where incomes are rising very quickly. And we got a lot of momentum. That to me, as compared to $3.50, $4 rents in California, it makes me feel like, boy, why couldn't that number very quickly get to Seattle's number in the higher 2s and low 3s? Why can't that happen over an accelerated period of time? So we're not underwriting crazy numbers in Denver, but we are underwriting significant same-store -- significant rent growth in the first few years and then some sort of normalization. But I feel like I've got likely more upside in places like that for the reasons I just mentioned. And we already have tons of California exposure. So if California does draft up, as you said, even better, great. We already have -- we'll always have 40% of the company in that state. But maybe we don't need to have 45-plus percent in that state. Is that helpful?\nHaendel St. Juste: That is. That is certainly, it sounds like, obviously, that there's a CapEx element in your comments about AFFO but just curious, as we look back over the prior decade, and we've seen cap rate compression between the coastal and non-coastal. Years ago, it used to be 50, 75 basis points, a few years back, maybe 25, 50. Today, we're sitting here right on top of each other. I guess I'm curious, where you think cap rates in place like Denver are 3, five years from now versus today, comparatively to, say, New York or California?\nMark Parrell: We got to start by knowing what interest rates are, what growth is -- I mean, I -- boy, I wish I was that good. That's the big corona question. Yes. I mean -- and by the way, do I have to know the answer for sure, if I'm spread out in places where there's knowledge workers, good general economic growth. I mean if we spread our bets a little bit, and we'll draft that no matter where it happens, right? And again, to be over concentrated in any one place, probably -- that's probably a lesson we've all learned. Even before the pandemic wasn't a great idea. And it isn't just, again, these coastal markets. Florida, every time hurricane season comes, we have no properties there, but we used to, I remember. Shuttering every time it started because I didn't know what it was going to do to our numbers into the condition of our properties. So I mean, every market has significant risk of 1, there's no riskless apartment market. So to be more balanced, I think, is a good idea in any regard.\nHaendel St. Juste: Much appreciated. Thank you for the time.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: Good morning, everyone. A question on office conversion. So we've heard some reports in the press that some major metros you're thinking about converting offices into apartments potentially or potentially just typical housing. Do you see that as something that's likely to happen? And could it potentially have any sort of meaningful impact on supply maybe that we wouldn't see in typical supply numbers?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Well, first off, anything that helps the affordable housing shortage is worth trying. So we'll start with that premise. Because, again, some of the conversations or articles I've read and you've likely read are about, can that help with affordable housing. I'm not sure, but let's give it a world because that's a real issue. But we -- the problem with converting offices, often, these are older office buildings, large floor plates, limited windows. So when you think about a lot of units that don't have outside access that don't have windows, I think Michael would tell you, those are going to be card units to rent. We do have a couple of buildings in the portfolio that were repurposed. One is a great asset that used to be the U.S. Steel headquarters down there the New York Stock Exchange on Broadway. That's a great asset that's really cool. It's also a pretty narrow asset. Everyone has window access and the property works. We have some out-West as well. Same thing, floor plate is a little bit smaller. There's an interior courtyard. I don't know what happens with a building that takes up half a block or more. And you're just trying to turn it all into apartments. I'm not sure how that's going to work. So I'm not that concerned with it as competitive to higher-end apartments. And I think we'd be open to trying to figure out a way to make it into affordable units. But again, this window issue is not a small one. Most people want to see the outdoors. I mean that's -- again, I think Mike will be very unhappy if we gave them hundreds of units to rent without windows.\nBrad Heffern: Yes. Okay. I think we can all agree with the windows. I guess a question on the guidance, yes. I was curious why the top end of the AFFO guide stayed the same just given that all the underlying -- or most of the underlying contributors moved up at the high end. Is there something that's maybe that you guys don't guide to that's depressing the top end of the range? Or maybe is there some conservatism built in, just given we're so early in the year?\nRobert Garechana: There's certainly no -- there's nothing that depresses the high end of the range, et cetera. So there's nothing in that regards from a guidance perspective. The only thing I would tell you from the ranges and the shifting of the ranges that you have to keep in perspective is where we started from. And that range, that initial NFFO range that we gave at the beginning of the year was very wide, right? So with a $0.20 difference. So it was probably abnormally wide relative to typical years in other time frames. But I wouldn't read anything into we shifted up the guidance range on revenue, on NOI and then we paired off the bottom end of the NFFO range, but I won't read anything of not raising the top end, if I'm answering your question.\nMark Parrell: Yes. I mean it's still kind of a math. Yes, it's kind of a math equation.\nRobert Garechana: Yes.\nMark Parrell: I mean it's - there's $0.05 more of FFO likely to come from operations. So you move the midpoint up a $0.05 to $2.75, and you didn't need the rest of the range. So it was kind of what happened.\nBrad Heffern: Yes, okay. Got it. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Upal Rana with UBS has our next question.\nUpal Rana: Hi. This is Upal in place for Brian. Could you give us some color on how much the impact on the extreme residential housing environment has on your business? And are you making decisions as far as rents or potential acquisition or dispositions given what's going on? Or are you taking a wait-and-see approach? Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Pardon me, I didn't quite understand that question. Are you asking what extreme are you referring to?\nUpal Rana: Just the low inventory in housing and some of the higher prices. How is that really affecting your business?\nMark Parrell: Great. So you're referring to single family housing. I'm sorry, we took that to mean apartments. The whole portfolio is designed not to have a lot of impact given the markets we're in from single family. So the fact that single-family prices are going up and availability is tight, that's somewhat helpful, I guess, to our business, but it's not as helpful as if we had a portfolio in a market where everyone wanted to be a homeowner right away. You think about markets like a Kansas City or something where people just -- they really living in an apartment is a transitional state for people with middle incomes, and they want to own a home right away, and there is a much purpose to being a renter as much advantage in terms of amenities in the city center. That's, in our case, our residents are thinking a lot about lifestyle and job proximity and other stuff. So single-family issues are really not terribly relevant to us right now.\nUpal Rana: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we are from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates.\nAlex Kalmus: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So I appreciate the favorable new move in trends and concession environment, how you're peeling off some of those. But I'm just curious how the brokerage commission component plays into your leasing strategy going forward? I saw you offer 20% so just curious.\nMichael Manelis: If yes. So for us, I mean, the use of brokers is really heavily concentrated in New York. And right now, I'll tell you, in the first quarter, we were just over, I think, $300,000 in broker fees. And it is truly directed towards the submarkets where we are still having the most pressure. So Gramercy, few assets in the Gramercy submarket and Chelsea submarket is where we will have kind of advertisements where we're willing to pay that broker fees. But you could see that $300,000 a quarter. My guess is as the market continues to improve, that our dependency on that brokerage in those submarkets will lessen.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much. And sort of touching on the renewals, maybe in a different way. What occupancy level would you feel comfortable at in your New York and San Francisco markets to sort of get to a more flat renewal rate? Is there any sort of benchmark that you'd look towards?\nMichael Manelis: Well, no, because, I mean, we're quoting our renewal offers in line with where that future streak is expected. So as we think about pricing trend, that effective pricing trend, as soon as it starts crossing over prior year in any asset or any submarket, those renewal quotes will go out with an increase. And then we'll just -- we'll start having the conversations with residents, but so much of our ability to focus on achieved renewal rate increase is dependent upon what is happening in that direct submarket around us? What are other options when that renewal offer comes in? And as concession use starts to abate, that power and the negotiation shifts back to the landlord.\nAlex Kalmus: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question today will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thank. So in terms of the concessions, can you just remind us in the guidance what that assumes in terms of -- I know you're going to continue to have this straight-line issue with the concessions. But from a cash standpoint, what are you assuming for concessions to the back half of the year. I know you give the monthly numbers, they've been declining. Do they continue to decline sequentially from here, they go to zero? How should we think about that relative to the guidance?\nRobert Garechana: Yes. So thanks, Nick, for the question. So our concessions, our assumption and guidance from -- and I'm going to talk from a cash basis, and then I'll talk -- mention a little bit the amortization. But is that we continue to see the good momentum that Michael has kind of outlined, and we continue to see the reductions that we mentioned, for instance, between like March and April. So we continue to think on a cash basis that they will decline. Because of the GAAP treatment and the straight-line amortization, in fact, we think that the cash numbers are going to flip soon such that the cash numbers are better than the GAAP numbers, meaning you're amortizing more concessions than you're actually granting on new ones. So you saw in the first quarter, the GAAP number was better than the reported cash number. I think that's going to flip, and that's what's encompassed in our guidance, if that makes sense. But it's a continued decline as we work through the recovery, and we're already seeing that well on the way, as Michael outlined.\nNick Yulico: Okay. That's very helpful. Just one other question on the concession activity is, if you look at -- I know we keep talking about New York, San Francisco, but these are markets where you did see concession activity coming down. At the same time, you're still 100, 200 basis points below prior to COVID occupancy. And so I guess I'm wondering why if you're going into the higher turnover season over the next second quarter, third quarter? Why if you're still below on occupancy than sort of long-term goals? Why would you be pulling back concessions in the market?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So I guess I would tell you, you need to really drill in and understand the assets that we're competing against. And what is the occupancy of that submarket that we're operating in. Because when we're looking at this, we're always trying to stay, call it, 100, 200 basis points above what we would say is market occupancy. But when -- right now, when you're in this recovery phase, the overall market occupancy is not as relevant as drilling into the assets that you're competing against and what are those occupancies. So I think this balancing Act of clearly in these more hard-hit areas, like the New York and San Francisco, is to really focus on recovering everything. Grab your occupancy and keep pushing aggressively on rate and dialing back concessions. San Francisco responded well on the pullback of concessions. New York was a little bit more resistant. And a lot of that has to do with the type of ownership that exists there.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And Nick, it's Mark. Just to add a little bit to that, mean our ownership in New York City, so Brooklyn and Manhattan as well as in the city of San Francisco, which is where all this action is really happening. That's about 10% of the company. And so it's a small group of assets. As Michael said, we're very capable of doing both. I mean we intend to raise both rate, diminish concessions and drive occupancy. But there may be buildings where we just can't move concessions. And Michael, but we've got great demand, but we just have that demand is super price sensitive. Then you'll see us just grow occupancy. But for the most part, now, we're in a better position. That demand we talked about in the fall, led to the occupancy improvements over the winter is leading to the pricing improvements now. And shortly, we hope will lead to the other abatement of concessions, though that's not in our guidance. We think concessions exist all the way through the fourth quarter, just a lot lower. But there's sort of this cycle we're in that I think is a very positive one.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Appreciate that, Mark. Thanks, everyone.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: And we do have a question from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Sorry, forgive me on, but that\u2019s why they pay the big bucks. So I do have a question about the tail, perhaps a longer tail to this recovery. Like as long as I covered multifamily, you go through the spring and summer leasing season when that's over, you kind of the years in the bag, so to speak, you start thinking about the next year. This time, the Magic Day seems like Labor Day, schools perhaps reopen, offices reopening, you have a different dynamic in terms of economic activity that could extend the activity level within your business. Do you see that as a potential outcome from this? Since it's so different than any other environment, we've seen that the ability to kind of extend your heavy leasing season could actually fall into the fall months because of those dynamics?\nMichael Manelis: Absolutely. I absolutely could see that playing out. We also have -- we had great traction in Q3 and Q4 of '20. So from a rent roll perspective, I will have more renewal activity kind of in that back half of the year. It's not a material shift, but it is a shift. So I really do think this demand profile and what we used to think of as a normal kind of peak leasing season is going to extend out and go into kind of the later part of Q3. And it could very well. We've seen other recovery cycles continue all the way through and push through the fourth quarter as well.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Just to give you some real-world evidence. We know you're a student of history like we are but the fourth quarter in 2011 for our New York portfolio, same-store revenue growth, again, fourth quarter 2011 was 7.4%, and the first quarter of 2012 was 7.1%. I'm not promising numbers like that. I'm just telling you that when a market is in a recovery, it can perform like that. And our expectation is there will be a very fulsome recovery in New York City and in San Francisco over the next few years. So we agree with you.\nRich Anderson: Great. Thanks very much.\nMark Parrell: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Parrell for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark Parrell: We thank everyone for their interest in Equity Residential and wish you a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: That will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. So with the first quarter now in the books and our spring leasing season ramping up, we continue to see strong performance build upon the early indicators we were seeing on our last call. The accelerated distribution of the vaccines have clearly had an impact on many of the states and cities where we operate as they push for return to a more normal environment. Our teams in our various markets are sharing positive news of neighborhoods that are starting to feel alive again as more and more companies get ready to reopen offices. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of work-from-home, we see our demographic is drawn to the amazing culture, food and art that our urban locations offer. They're excited about reopening of these experiences and feel a sense of urgency to return, especially knowing that these lower rents won't last for long. As you may remember from prior calls, we have focused our approach on maximizing revenues by balancing occupancy with rate and concessions, which has proved successful thus far. Our confidence in the recoveries of our cities, coupled with this disciplined approach, kept us from overreacting in one direction or the other and we are well positioned as the recovery takes off to sell our excess inventory at net effective rates that are currently 14% higher than the end of last year. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overall trends. So first, demand. Demand was strong through both the winter season and early spring with a continued trend of increased applications and move-in activity that is well above seasonal norms and has fueled a stronger-than-expected occupancy recovery. Occupancy is currently 96%. And as of two weeks ago, is now above the prior year comp period. And for the first time, beginning to approach 2019 levels. This occupancy strength is contributing to the improvement in our revenue growth recovery. Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions and is a good indicator of where market rents are headed, has improved across all markets during the first quarter and through April. We continue to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. In January, concessions averaged just under six weeks on about 1/3 of our applications. By March and into April, this has been reduced to about 20% of applications receiving on average four weeks, and we expect this to continue to decline into May. As stated in the management presentation, we have seen a 14% improvement in pricing trend from December 31 to April 23. Renewal rate negotiation pressure continues as we renew residents who signed leases at the onset of the pandemic before the declines and pricing trends occurred. Outside of Southern California and Denver, our other markets have pricing trend below prior year, which put pressure on renewal negotiations. This situation is improving weekly. And as Mark mentioned, we expect the other markets, excluding New York and San Francisco, to be positive by the end of May. April renewal rate achieved should be 200 basis points better than March, which was a negative 4.5%. The percent of residents renewing also continues to improve, with March and April, both achieving above 55%. These levels remain below our historical average for this time of year, but the gap is closing. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved continue to improve with sequential improvement in new lease change expected for the next several quarters. As previously discussed, renewal rate achieved was pressured in Q1, but the pressure will continue to moderate as pricing trend improves and as the rate on expiring leases which were written pre and early onset in the pandemic narrows with current market rents. On pages six through eight of our management presentation, we have provided color on pricing trends, physical occupancy, percent of residents renewing and leasing concessions for each market. So I will not repeat that here. But let me provide some brief market-specific commentary. I will start in Boston, where we are seeing an uptick in interest from students as many colleges have announced plans for campuses to open again in the fall. We may well benefit from limits on dorm occupancies as some students will need to find alternative housing. This market will face some headwinds from new supply, particularly in the city, where we are still dealing with some non-stabilized lease-ups from last year as well as a few new deals expected to deliver in the back half of 2021. New York is starting to see positive momentum. Demand is good, driven by both bargain hunters looking to upgrade and people returning to Manhattan in anticipation of office reopenings. Specifics around office re-openings remain unclear, but indications are that it will be a hybrid that has employees back in the office, at least part of the week by summer and early fall. In New York, concessions remain part of the marketing strategy, even while we are raising rates. This market held on to widespread concession use through most of the first quarter, but the last several weeks has shown concession use starting to decline. Unlike any of our other markets, New York has a more significant number of local operators not on yield management, who tend to use concessions more frequently. New supply is basically nonexistent in Manhattan, however, supply pressure on the Hudson Waterfront in New Jersey in the back half of this year may impact that submarket. Our migration data suggests that this market is beginning to return to normal as applications from outside the New York MSA and move-outs leaving the MSA, both continue to trend closer to normal pre-pandemic levels. Turning to D.C. During the pandemic, physical occupancy held up better in D.C. than any of our other East Coast markets. Absorption of new supply also has generally remained healthy that has slowed compared to 2019 levels. While demand in this market remains robust, we are facing some headwinds from new supply in 2021. D.C. has an excellent track record of absorbing new supply, but with more than 12,000 units being delivered this year, that track record will be challenged. Heading to the West Coast. Seattle trends are moving in the right direction, but the market has shown periods of price resistance. Tech companies continue to hire and are moving towards reopening offices. Amazon's recent announcement of its commitment to an office centric culture as their baseline is a very good sign for driving demand. The expiration of the H1B visa ban at the end of March should also be a good driver of demand as the tech sector was heavily reliant on this program for talent. On the supply front, new supply deliveries will rebound in 2021 with the largest concentration in the CBD down town submarket. San Francisco, one of the markets hardest hit by the pandemic is clearly on the road to recovery. Concession use in this market has shown a meaningful decline. Our communities located in the city of San Francisco are starting to feel vibrant again. Late in the first quarter, we saw a flurry of announcements from Bay Area tech firms with regards to return to office. Many of the tech firms, including Google, are taking a firmer than expected stance with regards to office attendance, as they recognize the importance of in-person work in both product creation and company culture. Schools are reopening with colleges planning for students to return to campus in the fall, and demand for our two and three bedrooms has clearly increased in the last several weeks. New supply will be elevated in 2021 with a large concentration in the South Bay, which may create some pricing headwinds for us. Southern California has been the strongest part of our portfolio during the pandemic. Los Angeles, despite being one of the most lockdown cities in the country, continues to have good demand. The city is opening back up, and the governor has set mid-June for a full reopening. The most encouraging sign in this market is the pickup in activity in the content creation sector. Television and movies that were filming in other states during the pandemic are returning to LA. 2021 new supply deliveries will be well spread out across the submarkets, with most of the expected pressure coming to us in the Mid-Wilshire, Koreatown submarket. Orange County and San Diego continue to be the real standouts in terms of performance. These markets have the highest occupancies and the best, albeit still negative, revenue performance. But we see same-store revenue growth in these markets turning positive in the second quarter. These markets should continue to benefit as the state opens back up, and travel and leisure activity picks up. New supply will be at normal levels and generally well spread out across the submarkets. While Southern California is generally one of our better performing areas, it has and continues to experience the highest levels of delinquency. We have mobilized our teams to assist our residents in applying for available federal rental assistance dollars, while California was ahead of most states in creating a rental assistant application process. The state is just beginning to process applications and to send out money. We will be aggressive in pursuing these California relief funds as well as other programs throughout the country. Finally, in Denver, demand remained strong across the market, although pricing pressure and widespread concession use is common downtown. Our two suburban Denver properties have little concession use and are seeing good demand and revenue growth, new supply will be elevated from 2020 levels, but good job growth should be a driver of the absorption of that supply. Across all of our markets, our focus will remain on increasing rates and continuing to reduce and eliminate concessions, our strategy of not chasing occupancy at any cost during the winter is paying off. So far, we have been able to grow our occupancy, while at the same time, recovering just over 60% of the decline in rate that we experienced from March to December of 2020. We believe that this approach will continue to benefit us as we move forward through 2021 and close that gap. Let me close by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. I am confident that we have the best team in the industry, and they are demonstrating the power of working together as they lead the markets through the recovery phase and remain relentless in serving our customers and taking care of each other. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Nick, this is Michael. So I think the way to think about this is pricing trend from Page five in that management presentation is the leading indicator of where the improvement is going to come to blended rate. And then after you see the improvement in blended rate, you start to see the improvement in revenue growth. So I think there's probably about a month or two lag that you start to see as we'll start to cross over. Now remember, the comp period from last year gets easier as we work our way through May and June. So our focus is really around that pre-pandemic period, which is what were rents like in each one of these assets at the very beginning of March 2020, and where we have good acceleration, we're focused on what was that high mark from '19 and how fast can we go after that. So I think as we keep pushing forward and keep getting that momentum over prior year, you'll start to see that blended rate improvement really kick into gear. You could see what happened just sequentially from March to April. I would expect you're going to see that same kind of real big pop as you work your way, April into May. Yes. Well, so I think near term, I think I said in the prepared remarks, it's had these moments of kind of fits and stops as our recovery goes. But if I would go a little bit further out, longer term, I mean, the demand drivers are strong in all of our markets. So as you really think about our ability to kind of grow revenue across our markets, all of these markets have unique aspects of what's going to be really delivering that demand growth. And I feel positive about really our opportunity as we work our way forward. We've still got this near-term stuff. We've got to work our way through, but the momentum is on our side right now. Well, I think I would say that the occupancy is catching up and that trajectory moves. Our focus really in both of those markets is to continue to claw back as much of this decline as we can, given the strength and demand we're seeing. We still got ways to go. If you isolate like Downtown, San Francisco to the nine properties or 2,500 units we have. We're still materially off from where we were at this time last year. The good news in that market is concessions have really abated. So now we have an opportunity just to grow that face rent. The opposite opportunity exists in New York right now, whereas concessions held down strong, and now our focus is let's keep trying to pull back those concessions. Even while concessions maintain that high level in the first quarter, we were trying to pressure test just raising up rate. So we have this a different opportunity in both of these markets to really go forward. So I wouldn't say it's -- let's pause occupancy and claw back all the rate or let's keep rates where they are and get all the occupancy. It's this constant push on both levers. That's a great question. So I think a lot still depends upon our ability to grow that pricing trend over the prior year and really back to that pre-pandemic level. So I would think I would look at this somewhere in -- we have an opportunity in the late second quarter, early third quarter to do it if that momentum stays. But I could also just see that number kind of moving out a few more months. If we kind of hit any section of pause in our ability to keep recovering and clawing back that rate. Well, I mean, I think from an affordability index, it's clear that the new residents moving in are going to be able to afford increases as we return to those pre-pandemic levels. As we've been pulling back even sequentially into April and as we think about where we sit today, even from last weeks, kind of applications coming in, we're pushing really hard, and we're not finding that resistance point yet. I mean, that's our goal, is to keep pushing and trying to find that resistance point. We haven't seen a change in the demographic profile. So I think from an affordability standpoint, the applicants coming in, they're all approved based on the gross rent. So regardless of concessions, they're approved on that gross rent and they're used to paying us that gross rent after they get past that first or second month. So I think that's something we'll have to watch in the markets where we -- like New York and San Fran, where we really kind of have momentum to dial back even more on that concession use. But to date, for the month of April, we have not seen any material change in that demographic. That is correct. That is correct. Yes, absolutely. You could just look at the slope. I mean, I would say we have been pushing. If you just look at the slope of the line, that's occurred. But our goal is to keep being as aggressive as we can, while we have that demand kind of coming in that front door. Well, I think it's a little bit of both. So clearly, we have some markets like the Upper-West side and Upper-East side, where we really have pulled back using concessions. You still have submarkets like Chelsea and Gramercy that you still see concessions are being used widespread across most of the applications. So I think at this point, we've seen momentum in the last three weeks, even in those tougher hit areas. So we're going to just keep opening. We could keep pulling back and dialing back not only the value of the concession. But just how frequently they are. The other thing you got to remember with the use of concessions is many times, what we're doing right now is we'll have concessions in place on vacant units to create the sense of urgency to fill our vacancy, and we will not offer concessions on noticed units, which is residents that said they're moving out somewhere at the end of May or into June. We'll advertise those units for sale, but we will not have concessions on them, and we are leasing those units without concessions. I think that's too early to tell, right? You could see the momentum in like a San Francisco, Downtown San Francisco, how fast you can pull back? So I think New York, or the Manhattan submarkets clearly have the opportunity to just pull back at the same pace. They haven't done that yet. And I think a lot of that does have to do with the type of ownership we have. Where you have a lot of kind of single-owned assets that aren't using yield management, and they're going to keep those specials in place until they fill back up, and then they'll eliminate the concession. So I think that's still TBD as to when we'll get back to a place where we're normalized on the concession use in that market. So the short-term rentals, I would say, at this point, we're not doing that. We see enough demand for conventional renters. So we're going to kind of hold off on going back to that type of renter. And as far as the ancillary income, I think we're still being aggressive where we can with all of our amenity fees, whether that's raising the parking. I mean, we spend a lot of time over the course of the last couple of years, improving kind of how we priced our parking spaces and how we kind of optimize the revenue from that. So I think there's still a little bit of opportunity left, but not a lot there. And then the other thing that feeds into some of those ancillary incomes is just our settlement fee. So when people break leases, what are the fees we charged. We clearly have increased those throughout the COVID period, we'll keep them at this elevated level. And then the other areas that we have right now, I would say we had some things in place pre-COVID that we're just not ready to go back to yet. If yes. So for us, I mean, the use of brokers is really heavily concentrated in New York. And right now, I'll tell you, in the first quarter, we were just over, I think, $300,000 in broker fees. And it is truly directed towards the submarkets where we are still having the most pressure. So Gramercy, few assets in the Gramercy submarket and Chelsea submarket is where we will have kind of advertisements where we're willing to pay that broker fees. But you could see that $300,000 a quarter. My guess is as the market continues to improve, that our dependency on that brokerage in those submarkets will lessen. Well, no, because, I mean, we're quoting our renewal offers in line with where that future streak is expected. So as we think about pricing trend, that effective pricing trend, as soon as it starts crossing over prior year in any asset or any submarket, those renewal quotes will go out with an increase. And then we'll just -- we'll start having the conversations with residents, but so much of our ability to focus on achieved renewal rate increase is dependent upon what is happening in that direct submarket around us? What are other options when that renewal offer comes in? And as concession use starts to abate, that power and the negotiation shifts back to the landlord. Yes. So I guess I would tell you, you need to really drill in and understand the assets that we're competing against. And what is the occupancy of that submarket that we're operating in. Because when we're looking at this, we're always trying to stay, call it, 100, 200 basis points above what we would say is market occupancy. But when -- right now, when you're in this recovery phase, the overall market occupancy is not as relevant as drilling into the assets that you're competing against and what are those occupancies. So I think this balancing Act of clearly in these more hard-hit areas, like the New York and San Francisco, is to really focus on recovering everything. Grab your occupancy and keep pushing aggressively on rate and dialing back concessions. San Francisco responded well on the pullback of concessions. New York was a little bit more resistant. And a lot of that has to do with the type of ownership that exists there. Absolutely. I absolutely could see that playing out. We also have -- we had great traction in Q3 and Q4 of '20. So from a rent roll perspective, I will have more renewal activity kind of in that back half of the year. It's not a material shift, but it is a shift. So I really do think this demand profile and what we used to think of as a normal kind of peak leasing season is going to extend out and go into kind of the later part of Q3. And it could very well. We've seen other recovery cycles continue all the way through and push through the fourth quarter as well."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thanks, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report that we are seeing significant improvement in our operations, driven by continued strong demand all across our portfolio. This, in turn, allowed us to extend the gains in occupancy we discussed on the prior earnings call. We are currently 96% occupied, 160 basis point improvement since December 31, 2020. We are especially encouraged by our numbers as we enter our primary leasing season, the period of peak demand in our business and by the continuing reopening activities in our cities. The improving pricing we noted on last quarter's call has accelerated over the past few months. Pricing trend, which is a leading indicator of where market rents are going and is computed net of concessions, is up 14% this year, and we have already recovered 60% of the pricing reduction we suffered as a result of the pandemic. In fact, on a pricing trend basis, collective pricing in our markets outside of New York and San Francisco is likely to recover completely by the end of May. The New York and San Francisco markets declined by more than our other markets, so they have further to go to regain pre-pandemic pricing, but momentum is strong in those two markets, and they are making good progress towards full recovery. To provide additional color on our operating trends, we posted to our website at equityapartments.com, a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations. After I give a quick overview of guidance changes and investment activities, Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide more detail on our current performance and forward trajectory. After that, we'll take your questions. The encouraging trends, I just mentioned, led us to raise our guidance ranges for physical occupancy, same-store revenue, same-store net operating income and normalized funds from operations as disclosed in last night's release. The midpoint of our same-store revenue range was raised 100 basis points to negative 7%, the midpoint of our NOI range was raised 150 basis points to negative 12% and the midpoint of our NFFO range was raised by $0.05 to $2.75 per share. These improvements were almost entirely driven by stronger and earlier than anticipated recovery trends in both our residential and non-residential operations across all our markets. We are well positioned heading into our prime leasing season, but our reported same-store revenue numbers will lag the recovery in our operating statistics as we work through the impact of lower rents and of concessions. In terms of the first quarter's numbers, the impact of the pandemic is readily apparent. We said previously that our reported same-store revenue numbers would get worse before they get better, and that's exactly what happened. Same-store revenues declined 10.5% for the quarter, which, while it was a bit better than we expected, is still among the worst revenue numbers in our history. We believe that our first quarter results will be our low point for the year and that they will improve from this point on. Turning to investments. While no dispositions or acquisitions closed this quarter, we have been active in the transaction market, and we expect to have a considerable amount of activity to report on next quarter. As we've said on prior calls, in order to create the most stable, growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are broadening our portfolio over time to increase our exposure to suburban properties in our existing markets, where the resident demographic is similar to our existing affluent urban resident population. We are also working on increasing our investment in Denver and continuing to consider a select number of new markets, that have large and growing affluent resident bases, favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and lower political risk. While asset prices are high in the locations in which we seek to invest, our funding source for these acquisitions comes from sales of existing properties, especially in California, where we are obtaining pricing that exceeds our pre-pandemic valuations. We expect to complete this transaction activity with minimal dilution and to stay consistent with our strategy of acquiring newer assets with modest capital expenditure burdens. The one piece of notable investment activity that did occur in the quarter was our $5 million investment and a fund that preserves affordable housing across our country. This for profit fund is run by long time experts in the affordable housing preservation and finance area. Using our equity capital and that of other investors as well as government financing, the fund acquires and improves the quality of existing affordable housing communities that would otherwise be at risk of either physical neglect or where the affordable restrictions are about to expire. We have been clear on prior calls of our steadfast opposition to rent control and other short-sighted policies that do not help solve the affordable housing shortage. Economists consistently say that rent control, in fact, leads to disinvestment in existing housing and impedes the creation of new housing. We support solution-focused investment like this fund that preserve or create affordable housing and favor the elimination of overly restrictive zoning codes that limit housing production where it's needed most. Along with ongoing engagement with public officials in our markets, this investment demonstrates our commitment to being part of the solution with respect to the affordable housing gap. To sum up, we are encouraged by the progress being made on vaccinations as well as the reopening of cities. Recent announcements made by employers, particularly in the tech industry regarding return to office are welcome news. We believe that the new operating model for most companies will be a hybrid of in-office and work from home and that our portfolio will benefit from workers looking to live close to the office. The unique cultural and entertainment options that are becoming available again, as cities reopen, are also magnets to our affluent renter demographic, and will draw them back to the cities and to the lifestyle, many of them crave. Our customer base has stayed well employed during the pandemic and can afford our current rents and absorb future rent increases as market conditions improve. 2021 is indeed turning out to be a year of recovery for our company. As we have said before, equity residential same-store revenue growth coming out of recessions has typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other economic conditions remain supportive. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to thank all of our investors for their continued support during these challenging times. We are well positioned to benefit from a return to normal as the pandemic subsides. We are optimistic about the future of our business and believe that our portfolio will thrive. I'll now turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael? Nick, well, just to be clear, the growth is really a swap, right? We're selling assets, as I mentioned in my remarks, predominantly in California, but also elsewhere. Getting really terrific pricing on that stuff and being able to trade into properties in Denver, for example, where we're going to expand our presence, we think, pretty significantly over the next few quarters. We continue to look at some new markets. And then again, suburban parts of our existing markets. So again, we'll have better detail. I actually have properties to speak to, but we're well along in that process. I expect to have a bunch close in the next month or two, and then to be able to talk about it in more detail in July. Thank you. Great question. So I'm going to look at cap rates, talk a little bit about cap rates with you, though we all know that's only part of the picture. A lot of these markets, almost all of them that we're either in or interested in with the exception of Manhattan, Brooklyn and call it, the city of San Francisco are trading at or higher than they did at the pandemic period. So we were looking at cap rates, for example, in Denver, 3.75% to 4.25%. I mean there isn't a market that's screening cheap. And in terms of expensive, I'd say the recovery is well-priced in. It's probably a charitable way to say it. I think these cap rates are low because people have confidence because even in the Sun Belt markets or places like Denver, there were declines in revenue. And I think what people are seeing is you're going to make that up, and you're going to make that up pretty quickly. And so they're willing to kind of capitalize that into the price. So with the NOI is still relatively low, that makes the cap rates low. So I guess I'd say there aren't any bargains we see. But what works for us is if we can sell some of these assets that whether it's locational or we have an over-concentration. We're able to get rid of, John, at pretty low cap rates, too at values in a lot of cases that are the highest, not just the pandemic, but we've ever seen and buy assets we really like at the same cap rates, even if they are, frankly, in the very low fours and in the threes, that's still a good trade for us. We still think that gives us that diversification we talk about, maybe a little better growth going forward. Again, we're always looking at newer assets, so we're not arbitraging new properties for old. We're typically buying in our markets. And in Denver, for example, assets that are 2016 vintage or newer. Well, let me start there. Michael may have something to add in there, John. But maybe we'll talk about the whole company for a second, and then we'll go to the market's question because we have been noodling on that a little. We're certainly not in a position to give '22 or '23 guidance. But I think when you look at how this company performed, Equity Residential perform coming out of recessions and thinking back to the tech bust in the 2002 vintage period and great financial crisis in '09. You've had a couple of years of negative growth. And then you've had kind of an in-between year, a transition year where we were right at zero for same-store revenue. And then you've had that snapback that you're referring to, where we're averaging 5% for three or more years of same-store revenue growth. What I think is different this time or is likely to be, first off, the decline was much larger. Absolutely. Both last year and this year, larger than the order of magnitude in those two prior cases. But I think we're going to skip the transition year and go straight, given the velocity, Michael is speaking of. We're going to go straight to a number that's considerably higher than that sort of transitional zero to de minimis same-store revenue growth. When you look by market, one market I was thinking a bit about before the call was New York. And we certainly hear a lot about New York and that kicked around a little bit. But when you look at the numbers after the great financial crisis, they had a couple of years. They had quarters where the numbers were 7% quarter-over-quarter. And I'd remind everyone that simply removing concessions is an 8% increase for a given lease in revenue year-over-year. So I think New York will put up some pretty good numbers, but in fairness, that's based on some pretty big declines. And I think the same is true for San Francisco. I think we've got a lot of confidence in Southern California. I think that market is doing very well. I think Seattle has been a little uneven. So I'll let Michael maybe comment on that. A lot of confidence in Boston, the recovery has been great in that market. There's a lot of good things happening in Boston. And again, in D.C., and we haven't talked about it in a while, but we're still going to have Amazon's HQ2 coming, and that's very close to numerous of our assets. So I feel like when I look at the markets, San Francisco and New York might post very significant quarter-over-quarter year-over-year numbers. But in fairness, that has to be judged by the level of decline that occurred the last few years. But when you just do compound numbers, I think Southern Cal is going to feel good. I think Boston is going to have a really nice recovery and come out of this more quickly than any place else. And I guess I'll defer to you, Michael, as you think about Seattle, because I just don't know how to think about that? Just - and I'm sorry to supplement further, maybe just a conversation about Denver, and this is just as applicable to Austin. I mean, a lot of the per square foot rents in those markets are $2 to $2.20 a foot per month. When you look at other markets that we think Denver will emulate like Seattle, there's a lot of room to run. I mean -- and when you look at single-family, and I was just out there with our Chief Investment Officer a few weeks ago in Denver, great quality of life, a lot of good things to say about job quality and lifestyle in Denver, but also single-family has gotten a lot more expensive. I mean, townhouse is that routinely are $600,000, nice homes but not elaborate. And again, our rents at that level compete well. And I feel like you could see some real out-performance for higher-end apartments in places like Denver and presumably places like Austin, the issue is that the market is pricing that in. And that cap rates are pretty darn low. But again, if we're trading out of assets we don't want, and it's at the same cap rate, and we're buying a better kind of growth stream, we think that math is going to work out for us. Thanks, John. Good morning. Sure. Well, I will tell you, I think on the past calls, I talked about the pressure we were having with studios and just not seeing a lot of demand for new leases there. That clearly is changing as we work our way through that first quarter and through April, just sequentially, from our point of April 23 to the end of that first quarter. We've improved 150 basis points in our occupancy of studios. So we're not back all the way where we were, but we're clearly starting to see that demand. And that's really an interesting standpoint because we're not seeing as much of the acceleration in the rate recovery on studios yet. So you're still seeing that attractive price point and that leads to that next demographic piece just from the overall affordability and like the household income. So what we've done is we're really focused right now in new residents that moved in with us during the first quarter. What do we know about them? So first, from the overall age profile and demographic, really pretty much in line with our historical average. Those move-ins had 33 -- they were 33 years old. It's a little bit less in like in New York market where we were 33.5. But historically, we were up in like a 35-year old, kind of moving in. So not a big change on the age. On the affordability index, which is really rent as a percent of income, we really saw no significant change across any of our markets. The portfolio is still averaging at 19%. So rent as a percent of income is 19%. When you drill into that because rates are still down, that means what gave is a little bit of a decline in the annual household income for our new residents moving in. It's just not a significant number, though. These are still affluent renters that are moving in with us. The most significant decline came in New York. But our average renters for Q1 household income was $215,000 in that market, and their rent to income ratio is still at 18.5%. So we've been kind of watching these demographic trends to see what's happening. The pattern of going after the larger units, the one and two bedrooms, we talked about on the last call, still there. We're well occupied on that front. Now the opportunity is studios. Sure. So I think by that, we'll just -- we'll talk about what we say is like our migration patterns. So like where are people coming to us from the new residents as well as when we look where are our residents that are leaving going. And I will tell you in San Francisco, we're trending back towards normal pre-pandemic levels, but applications from within the same MSA and state, both still remain elevated. Huge improvement sequentially from what we saw in the Q3 and Q4 period of last year, but they're both still slightly elevated, which really just means that you're still seeing kind of this deal seeker or people trying to take advantage of it just moving within the market. The New York front has really almost returned back to normal. It still has some elevated level of deal seekers from within the same MSA. But really, that is materially lower. We were up in like 80% of all of our applications in New York were coming to us from within the same MSA. Right now, we're back down to 65%, which is right in line with our historical norms. So you're going to ruin all the news for next quarter, but we did sell our last asset in Connecticut, and that was really an asset decision. It just wasn't a property that we thought had the renovation potential that the buyer did. So it's just a little bit of an older property, Alex. We are interested in a deal and will likely close shortly that is a New Jersey higher end affluent renter base. You can certainly commute into Manhattan, but there's a lot of folks that live at this property that are going to work in that area. So we are open. Again, New York has -- the New York metro has some huge advantages in terms of supply dynamics, in terms of having the largest base of high income rentership in the country by a long shot. I think you can say whatever we all might say about this President and the prior President's actions. But as it relates to infrastructure, and spending and things that the city of New York, the state of New York and the states around it needed. A lot of money is coming into these states to heal, so we're still open very much to investing in the greater metro area in New York. That's fair to say. We have 27 buildings in Brooklyn and Manhattan. I can't tell you how many we'll have in two years, but it will be somewhat less. And I think that we've got some of that 421a stuff, you might remember that we've spoken of, that's just hard for public reporting company to own. And I just think we're probably just a little over concentrated in Manhattan. And you may just see a slight net. But again, you'll see us find deals that we like in the metro area, and we'll buy those. We got a development deal in the New York metro area as well that we'll talk about next quarter or the quarter after. So I think we're willing to do both, Alex. But this trend of spreading out our capital is true in every market, and that definitely includes New York. And I think New York net will be smaller than metro. Thank you. Appreciate, Alex. Well, it's Mark. I just want to make sure we're answering the right question for you. When you start comparing price trend, for example, in July of 2020 in any of those markets, the pricing trend in July of '21. Because '20 kept going down in '21, we believe and hope and feel is going to keep going up, those numbers will cross and relatively soon. So we're trying to be careful. We're certainly happy that we're improving, and we see that as an absolute. But pretty soon, it won't be relevant to judge us against 2020 anymore. It's when do we get back to pre-pandemic 2019, early, early 2020, and we're making progress towards that. So to answer your question, yes, that will probably happen and those lines will cross. That's partly because we do feel like we can keep pushing pricing trend, that's partly because it went down so hard in 2020 in fairness. But I think you're going to see us talk more and more if things keep going this well about how and when we'll get back to late 2019, early, early 2020 type of pricing. Is that helpful? We certainly hope so. I mean, you're starting to ask a question that's more applicable probably to 2022. But again, we've all read the articles. Yes. We all read the -- I mean the setup is good. You got great occupancy. I mean, New York, in just a few weeks, will open up to 75% occupancy in office space. And we're seeing these numbers so strong. And legally, it's not open for more than 50% occupancy, that feels terrific to us. And again, we've all read about what happened after the 2019 or whatever it was Spanish-flu epidemic. There was a lot of pent-up demand for all sorts of things. And I think we'll see that. I think people want a little more space. Young people have been stuck at home with their parents. My kids included, one out, and they want to live where we own properties. And I think we're going to feel all of that, which is your Gen-Z comment. So I think we've got a good long runway here ahead of us as we get through this year, put the pain of 2020 behind us as a company and as a society. I think you're going to see some pretty good numbers from folks like us, apartment owners in these big cities. Well, that was shifty of you. But I mean, I'd just tell you, obviously, progress in the pandemic has to continue. Like I said in my remarks, economic conditions have remain generally supportive, but there's good momentum. The single-family market is very expensive still. I do understand all the return to office, work remote arguments, but I think there's still a very large constituency happy to live in our urban locations. Thank you. A little bit of both. When you think about growth, as I said in some of my prior answers, it's likely that New York and San Francisco will post absolute numbers that are somewhat higher in the near term, let's call it, so maybe '22, '23-ish periods. Just again, because the decline, John, was so significant before, I think when you start to talk about a longer period of time, it's probably good to have a little bit of a -- to be in a few of these growth markets and be a little bit spread out. So -- and I also just think diversification of all sorts is good. I mean, listen, we've talked a lot about political risk in some of our markets, but I'd point out, if you own departments in Texas, you probably have some pretty significant casualty and maintenance issues to deal with from the freeze. So there is no place that's riskless from physical point of view or riskless from political issues or whatever. So just having the capital in us being in 6, seven markets, it's probably better to 10 or 11, but I don't see us going back to 30 like we were in the late '90s. That's not -- that's too many to keep, I think, good track of and to be on top of. Thank you. Yes. Amanda, it's Mark. So we have given some thought. We've talked on prior calls a little bit about that. So again, this would mostly be for our current residents. Our thought isn't to compete with those sort of rework type remote work providers. It's more to provide an amenity to our residents that they're either paying for directly on a per use basis, maybe it's repurposed ground floor retail that we put a great Internet hub in and some furniture and then off to the races or maybe it's just space and existing amenities that we're bifurcating a little bit more so people can use it. So I don't really have an ROI for you as much as its stickiness. And I'll say that one thing we don't want to do is just hold on an empty retail for too long, assuming we can get cities to let us rezone it. We do have retail space that was vacated, and we're just giving a lot of thoughtfulness to whether we're just going to put new retail tenants in that space. And then you haven't forbid 2, 3, four years later, go through the same experience again. Because retail is a tough business. We're glad we have very little of it. So we may repurpose some of that additional space as potentially amenity space for our residents. But you shouldn't expect us to use it significantly as an independent rental stream. Thank you. Well, it's Mark. Thanks for that question, Haendel. Those are a little bit linked because the one thing we can't do with recycling is development. So if the 1031 rule's continue to be in effect, it's pretty efficient for us because we do have assets we want to exit in markets where we want to lower exposure to do -- use a -- do a tax-free exchange and then just move the money over. I would say on development, that's an area where in the past, we have used the ATM or have used other mechanisms to raise money because you can't 1031 into developments. You really need to have independent capital. Often, it's been pretty small. So we've used debt capital. But again, as our cost of equity improves here and as our -- it becomes a more relevant funding source, I'm open to it. Another way, by the way, to address our market concentration, our desire to rebalance is to make the whole company bigger. So you could use, again, ATMs and issuances to buy assets and not recycle. But as long as the 1031 -- and buy assets, I'm sorry, in new markets or in Denver, for example. But that's a process that could have more dilution associated with it. So I just want to be kind of thoughtful about it. I think you're asking a very fair question. I think you're starting at about the same place as you suggested. I think the assets we're selling often do have significant capital that needs to be invested. And I appreciate that's more of an AFFO thing than an FFO thing. But as you know, we think a lot about CapEx at EQR. And so in a lot of these cases, we're buying new product in Denver, and we're selling old product in California. And so I think the shareholders are much better off on an AFFO basis. I'll also say, again, when we're in Denver, looking at $2 to $2.20 a foot rents per month in a place where incomes are rising very quickly. And we got a lot of momentum. That to me, as compared to $3.50, $4 rents in California, it makes me feel like, boy, why couldn't that number very quickly get to Seattle's number in the higher 2s and low 3s? Why can't that happen over an accelerated period of time? So we're not underwriting crazy numbers in Denver, but we are underwriting significant same-store -- significant rent growth in the first few years and then some sort of normalization. But I feel like I've got likely more upside in places like that for the reasons I just mentioned. And we already have tons of California exposure. So if California does draft up, as you said, even better, great. We already have -- we'll always have 40% of the company in that state. But maybe we don't need to have 45-plus percent in that state. Is that helpful? We got to start by knowing what interest rates are, what growth is -- I mean, I -- boy, I wish I was that good. That's the big corona question. Yes. I mean -- and by the way, do I have to know the answer for sure, if I'm spread out in places where there's knowledge workers, good general economic growth. I mean if we spread our bets a little bit, and we'll draft that no matter where it happens, right? And again, to be over concentrated in any one place, probably -- that's probably a lesson we've all learned. Even before the pandemic wasn't a great idea. And it isn't just, again, these coastal markets. Florida, every time hurricane season comes, we have no properties there, but we used to, I remember. Shuttering every time it started because I didn't know what it was going to do to our numbers into the condition of our properties. So I mean, every market has significant risk of 1, there's no riskless apartment market. So to be more balanced, I think, is a good idea in any regard. Thank you. Yes. Well, first off, anything that helps the affordable housing shortage is worth trying. So we'll start with that premise. Because, again, some of the conversations or articles I've read and you've likely read are about, can that help with affordable housing. I'm not sure, but let's give it a world because that's a real issue. But we -- the problem with converting offices, often, these are older office buildings, large floor plates, limited windows. So when you think about a lot of units that don't have outside access that don't have windows, I think Michael would tell you, those are going to be card units to rent. We do have a couple of buildings in the portfolio that were repurposed. One is a great asset that used to be the U.S. Steel headquarters down there the New York Stock Exchange on Broadway. That's a great asset that's really cool. It's also a pretty narrow asset. Everyone has window access and the property works. We have some out-West as well. Same thing, floor plate is a little bit smaller. There's an interior courtyard. I don't know what happens with a building that takes up half a block or more. And you're just trying to turn it all into apartments. I'm not sure how that's going to work. So I'm not that concerned with it as competitive to higher-end apartments. And I think we'd be open to trying to figure out a way to make it into affordable units. But again, this window issue is not a small one. Most people want to see the outdoors. I mean that's -- again, I think Mike will be very unhappy if we gave them hundreds of units to rent without windows. Yes. I mean it's still kind of a math. Yes, it's kind of a math equation. I mean it's - there's $0.05 more of FFO likely to come from operations. So you move the midpoint up a $0.05 to $2.75, and you didn't need the rest of the range. So it was kind of what happened. Thank you. Pardon me, I didn't quite understand that question. Are you asking what extreme are you referring to? Great. So you're referring to single family housing. I'm sorry, we took that to mean apartments. The whole portfolio is designed not to have a lot of impact given the markets we're in from single family. So the fact that single-family prices are going up and availability is tight, that's somewhat helpful, I guess, to our business, but it's not as helpful as if we had a portfolio in a market where everyone wanted to be a homeowner right away. You think about markets like a Kansas City or something where people just -- they really living in an apartment is a transitional state for people with middle incomes, and they want to own a home right away, and there is a much purpose to being a renter as much advantage in terms of amenities in the city center. That's, in our case, our residents are thinking a lot about lifestyle and job proximity and other stuff. So single-family issues are really not terribly relevant to us right now. Thank you. Yes. And Nick, it's Mark. Just to add a little bit to that, mean our ownership in New York City, so Brooklyn and Manhattan as well as in the city of San Francisco, which is where all this action is really happening. That's about 10% of the company. And so it's a small group of assets. As Michael said, we're very capable of doing both. I mean we intend to raise both rate, diminish concessions and drive occupancy. But there may be buildings where we just can't move concessions. And Michael, but we've got great demand, but we just have that demand is super price sensitive. Then you'll see us just grow occupancy. But for the most part, now, we're in a better position. That demand we talked about in the fall, led to the occupancy improvements over the winter is leading to the pricing improvements now. And shortly, we hope will lead to the other abatement of concessions, though that's not in our guidance. We think concessions exist all the way through the fourth quarter, just a lot lower. But there's sort of this cycle we're in that I think is a very positive one. Thanks, Nick. Yes. Just to give you some real-world evidence. We know you're a student of history like we are but the fourth quarter in 2011 for our New York portfolio, same-store revenue growth, again, fourth quarter 2011 was 7.4%, and the first quarter of 2012 was 7.1%. I'm not promising numbers like that. I'm just telling you that when a market is in a recovery, it can perform like that. And our expectation is there will be a very fulsome recovery in New York City and in San Francisco over the next few years. So we agree with you. Thanks a lot. We thank everyone for their interest in Equity Residential and wish you a good day. Thank you."

            "content": "Yes. No problem, Haendel, it's Bob. So from a bad debt perspective, not a lot has changed. And you kind of saw that in the reported numbers from -- sequentially from Q4 to Q1. They're relatively flat. And that's what we assumed in our guidance is that they kind of stay the same. We do not assume any kind of material level of improvement. That's, obviously, a potential green shoot. We are very active in the process of working with our residents as it relates to some of these federal rental assistance programs. And that's particularly concentrated, as you kind of alluded to in Southern California, where we have experienced the most elevated amount of bad debt. And so that's a possibility, but is not incorporated into the numbers themselves. So for now, our best guess is just assuming that things stay the same throughout 2021. There's certainly no -- there's nothing that depresses the high end of the range, et cetera. So there's nothing in that regards from a guidance perspective. The only thing I would tell you from the ranges and the shifting of the ranges that you have to keep in perspective is where we started from. And that range, that initial NFFO range that we gave at the beginning of the year was very wide, right? So with a $0.20 difference. So it was probably abnormally wide relative to typical years in other time frames. But I wouldn't read anything into we shifted up the guidance range on revenue, on NOI and then we paired off the bottom end of the NFFO range, but I won't read anything of not raising the top end, if I'm answering your question. Yes. Yes. So thanks, Nick, for the question. So our concessions, our assumption and guidance from -- and I'm going to talk from a cash basis, and then I'll talk -- mention a little bit the amortization. But is that we continue to see the good momentum that Michael has kind of outlined, and we continue to see the reductions that we mentioned, for instance, between like March and April. So we continue to think on a cash basis that they will decline. Because of the GAAP treatment and the straight-line amortization, in fact, we think that the cash numbers are going to flip soon such that the cash numbers are better than the GAAP numbers, meaning you're amortizing more concessions than you're actually granting on new ones. So you saw in the first quarter, the GAAP number was better than the reported cash number. I think that's going to flip, and that's what's encompassed in our guidance, if that makes sense. But it's a continued decline as we work through the recovery, and we're already seeing that well on the way, as Michael outlined."

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.\nMarty McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.

Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue, because of subsequent events. Now, I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thanks Marty. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and our outlook for 2023. 2022 was a terrific year for Equity Residential. We finished the year, as we expected, producing same-store revenue growth of 10.6%. We continued to see good demand during the fourth quarter, but certainly saw a return of seasonality to the business. Our strong 2022 same-store revenue growth combined with modest expense growth of 3.6% resulted in same-store net operating income growth for the full year of 14.1%. With continuing positive financial leverage, this led to a 17.7% increase in year-over-year normalized FFO. I want to take a moment, thank all my colleagues across Equity Residential for their hard work and dedication in delivering these terrific results. In a moment, Michael Manelis will take you through our 2022 highlights and how we expect 2023 to shape up on the revenue side; and Bob Garechana will comment on bad debt and review our 2022 expense results and 2023 expense expectations, as well as recent balance sheet activities and then we will take your questions. We have provided guidance for same-store revenue growth at a midpoint of 5.25%, which would make 2023 another good year for Equity Residential and produce same-store revenue growth well above our long-term average. We do admit to finding 2023 harder to predict than usual. On the positive side, we go into the year, expecting a benefit from embedded growth of about 4.2% from leases written in 2022 and we also carry into the year and above average loss to lease, both of which will contribute to positive momentum for us, particularly in the first half of 2023. We also feel good about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. There still appears to be plentiful employment opportunities for the highly skilled workers that formed the bulk of our residents as evidenced by last week\u2019s blowout January employment and job openings reports. We saw big increases in employment in the professional and business services category, a smaller gain in financial activities and only a modest decline in information services, all big employment categories for our residents. So far the announced layoffs at tech and some financial firms while certainly creating a negative environment have not manifested themselves much in the government\u2019s reported numbers, or thus far in our internal numbers. We\u2019ve only seen a handful of residents terminating leases early due to job loss. Possibly the impact is delayed due to severance and other factors. But it is at least equally possible that the workers in these categories are being quickly reabsorbed into the job market. Our renter demographic has proven resilient in the past, and we expect them to continue to be highly employable. As to renter incomes, according to the Atlanta Fed wage tracker, college graduates wages accelerated in the fourth quarter, outpacing wage gains achieved by hourly workers despite the higher base. Looking at competition from home ownership and new apartment supply in 2023, we also generally see a favorable picture. Homeownership costs and down-payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making our product to better value. According to the National Association of Realtors, for their affordability index to return to pre-COVID levels, one of three things will need to occur: The 30-year mortgage rate will need to decline to 2.6%; home prices to fall by 1/3, our family incomes to increase by 50%. This is all very consistent with our internal data, which shows the percentage of residents leaving us to purchase a home fell to 9.4% in the fourth quarter from 15.8% a year ago. On the apartment supply side, we expect 2023 national new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the direct level of competition that we will face given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties. The Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets, in which we are increasingly investing and Denver, will see higher relative supply numbers in our coastal established markets and likely more impact, especially if that\u2019s coupled with a job slowdown. In terms of supply in our coastal established markets, where we still have 95% of our properties. Our internal research indicates that new apartments delivered near to our properties create significantly more short-term pressure on our results. As we look at 2023\u2019s expected deliveries through that lens, new supply within close proximity to our properties in our coastal established markets is actually forecasted to be below pre-pandemic levels with only the Washington D.C. and Orange County market screening as delivering above average supply close to our properties relative to these pre-pandemic supply averages. And over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across the country sets us up for good long-term demand. We do, however, fully acknowledge that despite what was good GDP growth in the fourth quarter and full year and continuing strong employment reports, the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate actions are likely to pressure job growth and economic growth as 2023 progresses. We took this into account in our guidance by assuming a lower rate of rental rate growth during 2023 than usual and a decline in occupancy. But whether there is or isn\u2019t a technical recession is of considerably less importance to us than whether job growth substantially declines and if so when. A decline at the beginning of our spring leasing season will be considerably more impactful than a slowdown later in the year. We also now expect that the elevated post-pandemic level of bad debt in some of our California markets does improve in \u201823 but at a slower rate than we previously hoped, as poor public policies encouraging delinquency continue. Bob will discuss all this in a moment. In sum, we make no prediction about a recession but have assumed some impact to our 2023 results from a job slowdown and flawed government policy and evictions, while continuing to see sources of strength in our business in the form of modest forward competition from home purchases and new apartment supply, the high employment ability of our residents even if the job market deteriorates from its current lofty levels, and the positive forward momentum from our strong 2022 results. On the transaction front, there was not much activity in 2022 for us. We only purchased one deal and we sold three others, two in New York City and one in Washington D.C. We did start a handful of new developments. These were mostly in our Toll joint venture structure. As we head into 2023, the transaction markets remain unsettled, but we see higher than usual supply in the Sunbelt and Denver markets in which we wish to expand as hopefully creating buying opportunities for us later in the year. For now, our guidance does not assume any acquisition or disposition activity, but remain committed to our strategy of shifting capital out of California, New York and Washington D.C., and into our expansion markets of Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta, as well as the suburbs and markets like Seattle and Boston, assuming appropriate opportunities present themselves. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Manelis : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everybody for joining us today. This morning, I will review key takeaways from our fourth quarter 2022 performance, expectations for 2023 and provide some color on the markets before I turn it over to Bob to walk through our financial guidance. 2022 same-store revenue growth of 10.6% was the best in EQR\u2019s history of nearly 30 years as a public company. Reported turnover for both the full year and the fourth quarter was the lowest in the Company\u2019s history, reflecting great demand that produced high occupancy and significant pricing power. In most of our markets, we had a supercharged spring leasing season with more robust pricing power that started earlier than usual in the year. Rents peaked in August, which is typical and then started to seasonally moderate, which is also typical. The seasonal moderation was a little more pronounced than we originally expected and likely due to a combination of rents reaching such a high peak, along with less pricing power than expected as we ended the year. Given current uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, this moderation isn\u2019t surprising, though the January employment report that Mark just mentioned was very encouraging. Sitting here today, we have good occupancy with solid demand across our markets. Our dashboards and current leasing momentum continue to signal a normal spring. Let me take a minute and walk through the building blocks of our guidance range of 4.5% to 6% revenue growth. This is an updated look to what we provided in our third quarter management presentation. So first, we start with an embedded growth of 4.2% for 2023. This is slightly below the midpoint of the range we talked about in the third quarter of 4% to 5%, but mostly consistent with expectations and takes into account the additional concessions used in the fourth quarter. Next, we expect strong occupancy for 2023 at 96.2% which includes a continuation of low resident turnover but is 20 basis points lower than that of 2022. Finally, we\u2019re assuming blended rates in 2023 will average approximately 4% for the full year. This assumption incorporates capturing our 1.5% loss to lease along with approximately 2.5% intraperiod growth in rates. This intraperiod growth assumes a positive impact from less overall pressure from competitive new supply and acknowledges some potential headwinds for a softening economy. For your reference, in a normal non-recessionary year, we would expect intraperiod growth to be about 3% to 3.5% with us capturing about half of that gain in same-store revenue. The first half of 2023 will benefit from the momentum we had last year, while the back half of the year faces tougher comps and could feel the impact of the economy, as the year progresses. The contribution of this blended rate growth to revenue will be approximately half, as we capture it over the 2023 leasing season. Add all of that up and the implication is revenue growth over 6%, which would be exceptional after a remarkable 2022. The midpoint of our guidance range however is 5.25%, which is lower because we do not expect bad debt net to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, and it continues to work against us this year, due to a lack of expected government rental assistance and the extension of the eviction moratoriums in both LA and Alameda counties. Bob will go into more detail on bad debt net, including our assumption in his prepared remarks. The outlook I just described is based on a belief that, while the economy may be slowing, our business continues to demonstrate a number of favorable drivers and resiliency. As we have often said in the past, we focus on our dashboards while also acknowledging the headlines. While keeping in mind that this is very early in the year, when we look at our dashboards today, the portfolio is demonstrating sequential improvement in both pricing trends and application volume, as we would expect, which by all indications is a typical pre-pandemic setup for the spring leasing season. New York and Boston will be two of our top performers in 2023, after delivering strong results in 2022. In San Francisco and Seattle, we are seeing good demand and sequential improvement in pricing with slight reductions in both the quantity and value of concessions being offered since the beginning of the year. Even with this modest improvement, the overall level of concessions are still elevated, resulting in weaker-than-anticipated pricing power. San Francisco and Seattle have been slower to recover than the other markets, but both posted really good revenue growth in 2022. Both cities have been balancing a combination of quality of life issues in their downtown, which are getting better and a delayed return to the office from large tech employers. In addition, there have been some layoff announcements from companies based in these two cities. These layoffs are a direct result of excessive hiring during the pandemic. This excess was spread across multiple markets and countries, not just Seattle and San Francisco. The remote nature of work in tech during the pandemic along with these hiring sprees, likely means that the layoffs are more geographically dispersed than in prior periods. Both of these cities remain hubs of the tech industry and share an entrepreneurial spirit that will continue to incubate the next big idea, be it AI or other innovations we find changing our lives a decade from now. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes that these markets continue to improve modestly as we get into the spring leasing season but overall weakness persists, which is why our intraperiod growth assumptions for the company overall are somewhat lower than the typical 3% to 3.5% range. If San Francisco and Seattle get some traction this year, that could have a significant positive impact on our same-store revenue growth as could a more rapid improvement in bad debt net, leading us to the higher end of our range. Reaching the bottom end of our range would require either rate growth to slow much earlier in the year than expected or occupancy to dip to the mid-95% range for a sustained period of time. And lastly, before I turn it over to Bob to discuss our guidance, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation. On the revenue side, we will continue to focus on other income items like Wi-Fi, parking and amenity rate optimization. We will also leverage data and analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margin. We have been a sector leader in limiting same store expense growth, and this is attributable to our team\u2019s willingness to embrace innovation and initiatives focused on centralized activities. We are driven to get the most out of the portfolio and continue to have great success in creating efficiencies in our sales and office functions. In 2023, we will complete the centralization of onsite activities such as application processing, and our move-out and collection process. On the service side, we will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create more opportunities to share our resources across multiple properties. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to the residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that I will turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Garechana: Thanks, Michael. Let me start with bad debt, which should round out our thought process on same-store revenue guidance, followed up with a little commentary on same-store expenses, normalized FFO and the balance sheet. As Michael mentioned, the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance assumes a 90 basis-point reduction in revenue growth due to the impact of bad debt. As we mentioned during last quarter\u2019s call, the biggest driver of this drag is the lack of rental relief payments in 2023 relative to 2022. Specifically, we received a little over $32 million in rent relief in 2022 that isn\u2019t in the numbers in 2023. And while we ended last year with more residents paying their rent than when we started the year, a trend that we would expect to continue, our forecast doesn\u2019t assume this will be significant enough to offset this lack of rental assistance. Unfortunately, recent delays in lifting eviction moratoriums and slow processing within the courts led us to this more cautious forecast that reflects a more modest improvement coming later in the year than we had initially hoped for. We\u2019re hopeful that this caution might be unwarranted, in which case we could achieve the top end of our guidance range. But for now, we still expect delinquency to return to pre-pandemic levels, but more likely in 2024 than in 2023. Turning to expenses, I\u2019m proud to report that in 2022, we once again continued to execute on our strategy of using technology and centralization to reduce exposure to labor pressures. Same-store payroll expense growth was negative for the second year in a row, and even when combining payroll with repairs and maintenance, a line item with significant labor exposure and product inflation, growth was below 3% for the second year in a row again. Combine that with low real estate taxes and we were able to deliver industry low expense growth. For 2023, the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance is 4.5%. This forecasted growth rate is about 100 basis points higher than what I just described for 2022 but well below both inflation and our revenue guidance, meaning we expect 2023 to be another year of operating margin expansion for the Company. Of the four major categories of expenses, repairs and maintenance and utilities should grow at a pace slower than 2022, while real estate taxes and payroll should be faster. These latter two categories face challenging comparable periods given 2022\u2019s remarkable performance in addition to the following drivers: For real estate taxes, we expect municipalities will recognize the great strong income performance for multifamily in 2022 and as a result take a more aggressive approach to assess values and rates. Total tax growth should be around 4%, up from 1% in 2022 with California continuing to benefit from Prop 13 at the low end of growth and expansion markets like Colorado, Texas and Georgia towards the higher end. These expansion markets are a small part of our same-store portfolio and the expected growth is consistent with what we underwrote on acquisition. For payroll, we expect 2023 growth to be around 3.5%, up from the decline of 2% that I just mentioned in 2022 and still well below typical wage inflation. We believe we can achieve this target through our continued discipline around staffing and optimization of our workflow. Turning to normalized FFO, page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. Our midpoint of $3.75 per share includes a $0.01 of forecasted casualty losses from the California rainstorms that we mentioned in the release, and results in over 6% year-over-year NFFO growth, a very solid year for the Company. Finally, some comments on our planned financing activity for 2023 and the balance sheet. We mentioned in the past that we have an $800 million secured debt pool coming due, most of which needs to be refinanced in the secured market later this year. The current rate on the pool is 4.21% and the maturity is in November. The pool is very financeable, given it is roughly 50% levered and covers debt service nearly 2 times. We have favorably hedged more than half the treasury risk on the financing and would expect to be able to refinance later in the year at a 5% rate or better, which is also incorporated in our guidance. After that, the Company has no maturities to speak of until June of 2025. We have low floating rate exposure, the lowest leverage in our history, significant debt capacity and ample liquidity supported by our recently recast revolver that will support our future capital allocation activities. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. You talked about the innovation impact and the benefits to potential margin expansion. Can you quantify the impact of those programs, both on same-store revenue and expenses in 2023?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Hey Nick, this is Michael. So first, I guess, I would say back in the November management presentation, we highlighted this whole technology evolution of our platform. That really has been focused on creating this mobility and efficiency in the operating model. And clearly, for the last couple of years, it\u2019s been more expense-focused and that shows up in the numbers that we just talked about. Specific to 2023, I think we\u2019ve included just over $10 million in the guidance with still about two-thirds of that benefit on the expense front, and that\u2019s spread out across a couple of various accounts in repair and maintenance, along with the payroll accounts. And the revenue impact is several million dollars in \u201823. But for us, it\u2019s probably going to kick in more in the back half of the year and really start to show up in 2024 as a lot of these initiatives we have don\u2019t get put into place until kind of the middle of the year. We got a lot of different pilots going on right now with like short-term and common area rentals, the property wide Wi-Fi. We\u2019ve got another 25,000 units being installed with the smart home. And again, most of this is going to contribute probably to the other income line. And I think you see about 20 or 30 basis-point growth in that number for 2023. And I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re excited about all of this stuff. We\u2019re going to continue to kind of look at the way we\u2019ve been doing this in the past, which is areas that are capital intensive. And the technology is like first gen. We\u2019re -- that signals to us that it\u2019s okay to be a fast follower in that area, similar to like how we approach the smart home installations and for us, we just want to make sure that we\u2019re going to get the appropriate return on this stuff. So, I think right now, the foundation is almost in place. By the middle of the year, we\u2019ll have kind of most of the operating platform where we need it to be to capture that benefit. And I think you should expect the $30 million to $35 million that we outlined in that presentation really to start shifting more towards that revenue front in \u201824 and \u201825. But at the end of the day, the reality is you\u2019re never done with this pursuit of operational excellence, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s clearly wired into the DNA of our company.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just maybe on supply, as you see new supply coming on, what\u2019s the concessionary environment today for those lease-ups? And maybe you can touch on concessions on stabilized properties as well in the market, if there are some. And then, what are the expectations for the concessionary environment in \u201823 for that new supply coming on?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So again, for us, we\u2019re very focused, right, on this proximity of the supply, when are the first units going to hit the market. And specific to the \u201823 deliveries, it\u2019s pretty clear to us across our portfolio that we\u2019re going to feel less overall direct pressure like from it. What we\u2019ve been watching is in the fourth quarter, which is really a bad time to watch for concession change because you typically see concessions inch up but in many of the markets, you\u2019re seeing that the new supply did absolutely grow their concessions compared to the third quarter and tend to be in that 6- to 8-week range. What\u2019s promising for us right now is that we did see, just like in the stabilized portfolio, starting the year in January, starting to see these concessions kind of fall back a little bit in the volume of the concessions that are being issued as well as the value of them. So for us right now, I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re still focused in San Francisco and Seattle is where we see the heaviest concentration of supply of concessions being used. And it\u2019s about 25% of our applications in San Francisco are receiving about two weeks. And then in Seattle, we have about 40% of applications receiving one month. And if you put kind of all of that into the blender and you think about like 2023 and our expectations, right now in our portfolio, we kind of normalize concessions to the 2022 level, so we expect to continue to see some elevated concessions in the shoulder periods. And it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s going to happen with the new supply across the market. It\u2019s clearly something we\u2019re going to be watching.\nBob Garechana: So Nick, just from a financial standpoint, like Michael mentioned, concessions are kind of flat, so no contribution to revenue growth or decline to revenue growth, \u201822 to \u201823.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Pawlowski: Alec, a question for you on the transaction market. I know things are pretty frozen right now. But from the trends you\u2019re seeing in terms of buyer and seller behavior, which one or two of your markets do you think is mispriced right now in the private market, either cheap or expensive?\nAlec Brackenridge: Hey John, yes, it\u2019s Alec. It\u2019s hard to say that any one is mispriced right now because there\u2019s so little transaction activity. The activity that we have seen is typically, say, 1031 buyer who has to place money or maybe a seller who for whatever reason has to move a property. But that\u2019s been really hard to -- and few and far between. It\u2019s very hard to pick market and say any one of them is more opportunistic than the other. I would say though that looking forward, markets that have a lot of supply coming are -- typically it\u2019s coming from merchant builders who are not capitalized to own the property in the long run. And so, I expect to see some opportunities there, new product coming from merchant builders that really want to move it. And other areas of opportunity are -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read about the private REITs that have the redemption requests that they need to fulfill. Not all of that product is a great fit for us, but some of that might be an opportunity. And then, you have the guys who took on floating rate debt that have caps that are expiring. So, it\u2019s been really slow, but I think that there\u2019s going to be more opportunity in the next six to nine months and more capitulation probably coming from sellers than buyers given how the financing market has been pretty choppy.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. That makes sense. Just a follow-up there. You mentioned the private REITs, merchant builders and then variable rate debt, those kind of sources of potential distress. How would you rank the level of distress or capitulation among those sources right now, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, 1 being no problems at all?\nAlec Brackenridge: Well, the merchant builders really just -- it\u2019s just not their game to do that, with rates being high -- I don\u2019t know how to put a number on that, to be honest with you. But I think that there will be some trades there. Obviously, some of the private REITs have found alternate sources of capital. So maybe they\u2019re able to mitigate that a little bit. And clearly, these caps are probably the highest among the three. And because they\u2019re so much higher than they -- I think they\u2019re 8 to 10x what they used to cost. So that clearly is an area that\u2019s going to be very challenging.\nMark Parrell: Hey John, it\u2019s Mark. Just to contribute to that, because it\u2019s hard to number order it, like you said, but it\u2019s easy to think about what it costs to wait. So that option a seller has is costly because SOFR, which is now the new index rate is 4.5%. So you figure -- if you have a development loan, you\u2019re 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points above that. So you\u2019re somewhere at 7% to 8%, 8.5%, that\u2019s expensive debt to be sitting around hoping for an improvement. Meantime, the preferential rate on your equity is likely something like 8% as well. So I do think, as Alec said, unlike in the past, that option cost of waiting is more expensive for the seller than it\u2019s typically been. And these caps -- again, a lot of these caps were struck at 4% or 5%, they\u2019re deeply in the money now. So I mean, clearly, the price of a cap that a lender would require you to get is going to be very expensive. So, I think those are significant pressures. The private REITs are out there. We see product. And again, not all of it\u2019s suited to us. They have other levers they can pull as well. But I think you\u2019ll see more from them through the year as well. But we don\u2019t see a panic sale market at all. We just expect people to sort of capitulate and just say it isn\u2019t going all the way back to 3.5 cap rates in the next six months, so we\u2019re going to go and sell at the market price, whether that\u2019s high-4s, low-5s, medium-5s will -- yet to be determined.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChandni Luthra: Just talking about Seattle and San Francisco a little bit, you guys talked about quality of living as an issue. Are you seeing any dispersion across property types in those markets, downtown versus the rest? And then, are there any signs of slowdown beyond the central business district that you\u2019re seeing in your numbers, in your databases at the moment?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Hi Chandni, this is Michael. So, I think in both of those areas, clearly, you saw more of the concession use in the fourth quarter concentrated into those urban cores of those markets. The demand is there across urban, suburban across all of the submarkets. It just got a little bit more price sensitivity to it. And clearly, I think the urban still has more pronounced price sensitivity than the suburban areas. And we haven\u2019t really seen any change. Like in the demand profile coming in, we haven\u2019t seen any shifts like going urban or suburban in those markets, the profile seems very similar to what we are typically used to kind of seeing in the market. And right now, I guess I would tell you, when we look at these January stats and we think about the sequential improvement that we\u2019re seeing over kind of the December numbers, those urban markets are actually kind of growing at a pace a little bit faster than the suburban and probably because we\u2019re pulling back on the concession, right? So, when we think about that, you can see you pull back a couple of weeks on a concession, that\u2019s like a 4% change in pricing right off the bat. So, no real signals yet to any significant change other than what we have felt, which is the urban cores, which by the way, do feel better from a quality of life. You could see the efforts that are being placed in both of these cities right now on it. You can feel the improvement there. But you still just have more pronounced price sensitivity in those urban areas.\nChandni Luthra: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And this one for my follow-up, I\u2019m not sure if you guys look at it that way. I know you guys do a lot of bottom-up stuff. But as you think about different markets, what\u2019s your overall job growth assumption? And then, what\u2019s your sort of top market versus bottom market as you think about job growth forecast in there, how much delta are we looking at? Are you still in positive territory on the West Coast? Any color there would be appreciated. And I completely understand if that is not something that you guys look at that level of detail.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Hey Chandni, it\u2019s Mark. We don\u2019t look at job forecast -- national job forecast, especially as particularly relevant to our numbers. We do focus a little more on the bottom up. We do spend time and we\u2019ve done the regression analysis and a lot of the work to try and understand how different variables, job growth, like foremost and household income among them, impact our numbers in the near term. And so we do kind of gut check what comes out of the bottom-up process with our perspective from the top down, both in terms of numbers that your firm and others put out there as potential forecast. But we don\u2019t have a model that we would rely on that would spit out numbers. I think there\u2019s just too many variables. We back tested lots of those models. And I\u2019ll tell you, we don\u2019t have confidence than that system being a better one than looking at it from the bottom up, feeling your market, understanding local drivers of employment, local supply and sort of thinking about your business that way, has proven to us to be much more reliable. So, we feel really good, though, about job growth in our markets generally. I mean, the employment report last week was terrific. Our residents, as I said in my remarks, they found work when they\u2019ve lost their positions. And it\u2019s been a very small number of people, literally handfuls that have handed us their keys. So, this is -- if this is a recession, it\u2019s the best one we\u2019ve ever been to. And it\u2019s going pretty well for us so far. So, I don\u2019t have anything to share with you in terms of top-down job forecast inputs.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Mark, to stay on that question and your comments about sort of getting the keys back. Is it concentrated in any one market and are there other discussions where maybe people haven\u2019t given you the keys back, but there\u2019s conversations with managers and people are a bit more on edge about finding kind of work in the tech markets? Or just how would you handicap that?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So Steve, this is Michael. So I guess, I would say that we started this back in kind of the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter, just really kind of tracking that like going deeper on reasons for move out, if people said job change, to understand it. And we are talking like less than a dozen. And when you say concentrated, I mean, it\u2019s such a small number, but it really is spread only in the Seattle and San Francisco market. And I think the teams, if you went across the country would say we always have one or two that come in and say that they lost their job and they\u2019re leaving, and that\u2019s why. So we really haven\u2019t seen anything. And clearly, there\u2019s some conversations when you get into the renewals with some folks that they tell us that they\u2019re changing jobs or that they lost their job. But in the concentrations of Seattle and San Francisco, it doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re overly concerned that they\u2019re not going to be gainfully employed, quickly.\nMark Parrell: And Steve, it\u2019s Mark. Just to supplement on that just a bit. Our transfers are low, too. So sometimes you\u2019ll see people going down to a cheaper unit and things like that that can also be an indicator of stress. We don\u2019t see that in any meaningful size. And we did a little research, I want to share. We asked our folks in markets like San Francisco, Seattle, New York. When a local firm announces a layoff, then tracking that either using the filings, and I believe you do something similar, using the various governmental filings or some of the layoffs, dot, whatever websites and what we\u2019re seeing is just like these tech jobs and a lot of these financial jobs were spread over the whole country of late, these layoffs are spread over the whole country. So generally, we\u2019ve seen a Bay Area company or a Seattle company announced layoffs, 20% to 30% of those are in that home market and the rest are spread all over the country. So I think what you and I, right, recall from \u201801 where if you had a tech layoff in San Francisco, that person was definitively in San Francisco, I think it\u2019s much more diffused now, and it\u2019s just a different sort of employment picture than it was in the past.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks for that color. And then, maybe just circling back on the transaction market for either you or for Alec. How have you guys changed your underwriting, whether it\u2019d be IRRs or kind of growth? And kind of where do you think the market is today for both acquisitions and for you guys to start any new development projects?\nAlec Brackenridge: Hey Steve, this is Alec. Yes. So, our cost of debt is somewhere around 5%. We would expect a cap rate to be close to that or above that. Longer-term, we\u2019d look at an unleveraged IRR of about 8%. And that\u2019s really hard to find in today\u2019s market. There are a few opportunities here and there, but largely, sellers are still hanging on to a 4.5% to 4.75%, which is just hard to make the numbers work. And as I said before, I think there might be a little movement on that end. Harder still is the development yield. And if you\u2019re thinking that stabilized properties are pricing at around of 5, then development really should be around 6, and it\u2019s hard to get to that number with costs continuing to escalate, not as fast as they had been,, whereas they used to be escalating at say, 1% a month, now probably closer to 0.5% a month, but they\u2019re still going up and getting from a 5 to 6 is a pretty heavy lift. And most deals prior to the rate hikes were price -- development deals pricing out to about 5% to 5.25%, and that was a nice spread when cap rates were below 4%. Obviously, that\u2019s not the case anymore. So getting to a 6% is a heavy lift. And there\u2019s just so much that can come out of the price of the land because land is typically, say, 10% to 15% of the entire deal. So it\u2019s a heavy lift to get to there.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: On the subject of bad debt, given the resident relief funds are likely not going to be there as much this year. Can you just clarify what your bad debt was in 2022 on a gross basis versus where you think it is going to be this year? We calculate it at 2.3 going to 1.9, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other factors in there. So I just wanted to clarify that with you.\nBob Garechana: Hey John, it\u2019s Bob. No, your math is actually pretty accurate. So page 13 kind of gives you a perspective. We were 1% net. When you add back the $32 million that is -- and the math that you probably did to the bad debt, that does work out to, I would have said, 2.25% as a percentage of revenue. And then when you move forward based on the drag on same store, we get to like around 1.90, a little bit closer to 1.85 as a percentage of revenue on that. So you guys have got it triangulated correctly.\nJohn Kim: Minor miracle. So, where do you see it going in \u201824? Are you saying it\u2019s normalizing, where does it go back to normal levels? Can you remind us what that is?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So, normal would have been around 50 basis points, would have been kind of typical. And we still do think that that is given the quality of our resident base, et cetera, that that is the likely long-term outcome. And as I mentioned in my remarks, just to be fair, too, it is very difficult to forecast kind of the projection of how fast this improvement that we have seen even outside of rental relief will come. We\u2019re hopeful that it\u2019s faster than what we put in the numbers, and that could get us there quicker and closer to that 50 basis points faster than what are in the numbers, but you\u2019re correct as to as to -- it is not only a minor miracle, but it is great when math works. So your math works perfectly in that specific numbers.\nJohn Kim: Just one quick follow-up. You said on the $800 million debt maturity this year that it needs to be refinanced in secured market. Can you just clarify on that comment? Is that because the pricing is better, or are there other factors?\nBob Garechana: No, it\u2019s structural. It\u2019s a structural kind of tax protection component. It\u2019s a piece of debt that actually was financed related to the Archstone acquisition. So, there are certain partners that were in the old Archstone structure that had tax protection. So, we have obligations to maintain some secured debt, a portion of that in secured, and that\u2019s why. As you think about the -- so it has nothing to do with kind of anything about that structural piece. When you do look at kind of the secured debt markets relative to the unsecured, the unsecured has come in a little bit. So, it\u2019s slightly more favorable than the secured, but they\u2019re all pricing in that, call it, high-4s range, especially for really low levered product in the secured like we had -- like we have in this pool. So it\u2019s not a market decision choice. It\u2019s more of a structural choice.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Kramer: Hey guys. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. Look, I just wanted to ask a little bit about kind of the January commentary. Maybe it\u2019s the seasonality commentary in the release. Look, Mike, I think you kind of -- you mentioned, right, maybe a little bit worse than seasonal in the fourth quarter. But at the same time, right, I think January, new lease I mean is strongest among the group, still kind of positive 140 basis points. So, maybe just kind of trying to tie or square these different things together, right, the occupancy loss, strong new lease and kind of the seasonality comments and try to kind of tie or blend all those things together in terms of kind of what\u2019s happening right now with fundamentals.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Hey Adam, it\u2019s Michael. So, I think what I would look to is one, the sequential comment I was referring to is December to January, not like when you\u2019re looking into the release, the fourth quarter to January numbers. So, when you think about occupancy, our occupancy actually held flat, right? We were, I think, 95.8% in December; we\u2019re 95.8% or 95.9% for January. And so, I look at that and say, as you think about returning to normal seasonality, it is very common for occupancy to trade down into that fourth quarter. So what we saw is that pattern kind of emerge. And outside of some of the pricing pressure that I described, some of the additional concessions, the way that the rents moderated is very consistent with what you would expect. That being said, you turn the corner and you get into January, what we normally would see in January is right after that new year, you see sequential improvement every week in application volume and rents ticking up and we got a little bit of an accelerant, like I said, in the urban because we started pulling back concessions when we saw that inbound demand doing what you would expect it to do. Now, what\u2019s interesting is like the cold weather climates like Boston and New York, they kind of tend to stall in February. You get a little bit of a boost in Jan and then it stalls and then you hit March and then you\u2019re kind of off to the races for the spring leasing season. So, I think my commentary was just pointing to you if I went back and looked at \u201818, \u201819, any of these years, the trends that we\u2019re seeing today, and again, we\u2019re five weeks into the year or something like that is very consistent with a normal year, which would tell us you would expect a normal spring leasing season.\nAdam Kramer: Great. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks for all that color, Michael. Just maybe switching gears a little bit to development. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I don\u2019t think it was mentioned much in kind of the opening comments. I know it\u2019s -- obviously not kind of your biggest part of your business, but you probably do a little bit more development than some of your peers. I\u2019m just wondering kind of what the thoughts are there? Are there going to be starts in \u201823 or is that kind of more on the back burner now kind of given some of the uncertainties in the environment?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks for that question, Adam. We have a terrific development team, both the in-house team that started and built $400 million towers as well as much smaller projects. And then we\u2019ve got the JV with Toll and others. So, we think development is a nice complement to our acquisitions, particularly in these expansion markets. The instruction that Alec and I have sort of given both our outside partners as well as our internal teams is find things that you can work on for the next few months that we can start late this year and sometime next. Maybe the capital will be a little more reasonable, maybe the underwriting will be a little bit better, maybe the cost structure will make a little more sense. And so, let\u2019s be thoughtful about starting a lot right now where you really feel like your opportunity is likely to be in the acquisition market. But we\u2019d love to tactically start. We\u2019ve got a few things already in the sort of inventory we\u2019d like to do, but it\u2019s just got to make sense. I mean, we\u2019re just not going to plow ahead and put our shareholders\u2019 money into a development deal if acquisition is a cheaper alternative or if just the costs and the risks involved are too significant. So to answer your question about development, it\u2019s very important to us. We don\u2019t have any starts really in the budget for this year. But just like acquisitions, we don\u2019t have any of those either. But we\u2019re happy to do plenty of them. Bob commented on the balance sheet strength. I think the debt markets would support a big EQR issuance to fund either of those, if we thought that was a good idea. So, we\u2019ll just keep watching it closely. And if there\u2019s something that comes there on the development side, like I said, we got the internal team, we got the Toll folks, we\u2019ve got others. I mean we can put that into gear. But we\u2019re happy to have it at zero, too, if that\u2019s the right decision for the shareholders.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey. I just want to follow up on that last question a bit first. So understanding that this early season pickup maybe in line with the historical trends as you mentioned. I guess, I\u2019m more curious on your comments about expectations for normal spring leasing season and what that would imply near term for new lease rates. So maybe can you give some more color on how that normal trend has played out historically, what that could mean for new lease rates here into the spring season? Thanks.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Hey. This is Michael. So I think the way to think about the modeling of what a normal curve would look like is what we will see right now is new lease change will start to sequentially grow and typically will max out somewhere in that third quarter and then will seasonally moderate as you get to the year. For our assumption of this blended rate of 4, we basically are assuming about 2 -- a little over like 2.25% in new lease change across the whole year but it is -- it\u2019s kind of like a bell curve. We\u2019re going to work our way through the spring and keep building it and then we\u2019re going to let it moderate. When you think about renewals right now, on capturing some of the loss to lease, we have some pretty good numbers at a 6.9% achieved renewal increase in January. Our expectation, and I\u2019ve got these quotes out for the next 90 days, we\u2019re going to stay somewhere in this 5% to 6% range in this first half of the year. And then I would expect that number to moderate like it would normally do into like a 4% to 5% range in the back half of the year. So, on a full like likely guidance model that puts renewals somewhere just north of 5% and when you put those two together and you think about the retention factor, it winds up getting you to that blended rate of about 4%.\nHaendel St. Juste: That\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate that color. Maybe some color on your expectations between some of the stronger East Coast markets, New York, Boston, D.C., in contrast to some of the weaker West Coast, San Francisco, Seattle, curious how the spread between those two -- or what do you thinking you\u2019re expecting for the spread between those two regions this year? Thanks.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Well, maybe I\u2019ll just kind of bucket the markets around. So I think I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, New York, we expect it to be our best performing market followed very closely by Boston and then really close by San Diego and Orange County as well. I\u2019m going to put aside L.A. and San Francisco for a moment because of the bad debt implications. But if you really looked at all of our other markets, you could almost bucket them in this 4.5% to 5% kind of revenue growth range for 2023. And then you get into the San Francisco and L.A. that has the bad debt impact. Without it, both of those markets would be in this 4.5% to 5% range as well. But with it, San Francisco, right now, we\u2019re forecasting around just under a 3.5% growth and L.A. is just north of a 1.5% growth.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJeff Spector: Just wanted to talk a little bit more, Mark, about your comments, and I totally understand the uncertainty on the macro, our econ team has once again pushed out its recession forecast for the second half of \u201823. So, I guess, just thinking about macro versus what your revenue management systems are telling you as the weeks go by, how will you be operating through the start of peak leasing into peak leasing and if things do look like -- again, if it looks like it\u2019s going to shift to the second half, how does that make a difference to how you\u2019re approaching the peak leasing?\nMark Parrell: Hey Jeff, it\u2019s Mark. I\u2019m going to start. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Michael. I mean, we\u2019re lucky to have a very experienced team here and -- both here in Chicago and then across the country, and a great system for feeling the markets. So, when we start seeing a market improve, when we start seeing a market deteriorate, we can react -- or frankly, a submarket or an asset, we react in real time. We don\u2019t wait for macroeconomic data. So, we\u2019re certainly aware of what\u2019s going on. We watch all those employment reports keenly. But I think we\u2019re ahead of that. I think we feel that in our leasing in advance. Because again, if someone lost the job and they immediately got a new one, the government\u2019s data may take some time to show that. The unemployment reports have been really good. So I guess I would say, as we go through the year, we\u2019re going to depend on Michael and his team, and he can elaborate on that in a minute. I have a great revenue management process, great communication on site to sort of see what\u2019s going on in real time and adjust in real time.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. And I think, Jeff, the only thing I would add to that is clearly, you\u2019re going to try to maximize rate and you\u2019re going to see whether or not you\u2019re getting that corresponding closing rate or the application volume that you need based on how many units you have to sell. And that\u2019s typically what we\u2019re looking at week in, week out, which is that ratio, and then we\u2019re making decisions whether or not we\u2019re leaning in on rate or kind of letting the rates soften a little bit and kind of position ourselves differently. But, on top of just that feel that you have, we\u2019re watching these demographic changes, the income ratios, I think Mark alluded to before, we\u2019re hyper focused on transfer activity, are they moving up in size, down in size, what are they doing, roommate activity. And then, of course, we\u2019re watching that new supply in these markets. And that concession volume that they\u2019re issuing is a signal to us whether or not they\u2019re getting the velocity they need because that absorption rate of that supply is going to tell us whether we\u2019re going to feel more or less pressure from it.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Just to add one last thought. It\u2019s Mark again. I mean, we do think about overarching themes. I mean, Michael has been running the business ever since the economy started to feel a little shakier, with a focus on occupancy and retention. He\u2019s opened up some of his renewal ranges. So, we do -- macroeconomics and what we feel in the general U.S. economy does inform some of these leans but we\u2019re quick to learn from what\u2019s going on on-site, and that\u2019s more important to us than any set of numbers coming from anywhere else. So I\u2019ll also tell you in places like New York and Boston, we feel so good about the supply picture and heretofore the jobs picture that those markets are places where our lean will be more aggressive than a place where we might have more anxiety like downtown San Francisco or downtown Seattle. So, we do inform some of those decisions, Jeff, with the big picture. But again, we like to watch what\u2019s going on property by property.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. So I guess, just to confirm then, as we think about the guidance and the upper half of the range, if this recession is pushed out to the second half, is that kind of the upper end of the guidance range scenario?\nMark Parrell: Again, where\u2019s the recession and what part of the economy? And I guess, I\u2019d say if we get through the bulk of the leasing season into July and August and the job numbers are still pretty good and unemployment claims are still pretty low, then I\u2019m very much of the mindset that we\u2019ll have a really good year. If you start to feel those numbers roll over in March, then the year for us and everybody else in the apartment industry is going to feel a little different.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. First question, maybe for you, Mark, is how you guys are thinking about potential for stock buybacks? I mean, you\u2019re not -- not as much acquisitions planned now, harder to pencil as you\u2019ve talked about, you do have a fair amount of free cash flow after the dividend. So, -- low leverage balance sheet. So I\u2019m just trying to understand at some point the stock buybacks become compelling? Do you need asset sales to fund that, or did the balance sheet already set up in a way to handle stock buybacks?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks for that question, Nick. I mean, we\u2019ve had versions of this conversation before. The unique thing about a stock buyback versus some of the other investments we make is it has both a capital allocation and a capital structure impact. I mean, we don\u2019t retain a whole heck of a lot of cash flow after CapEx because we\u2019re a REIT, and we have to distribute all our income. So, we look at it, it\u2019s either incurring a whole -- I mean to make a meaningful impact on a company our size, you have to incur a meaningful amount of debt and go out there. And we can do that. We\u2019ve got space for that right now. But you can only do that one time before you\u2019ve affected your ratings, you\u2019ve affected your multiple. We all learned in business school, riskier businesses with more debt, have less multiples, lower multiples. So, the debt side is possible, but it has offsets and is risk. And I also tell you on your asset sales, I mean, Alec and his team have bought well over the years. We\u2019ve done a lot of 1031s. So, there\u2019s a lot of embedded gains. You might sell an asset for $100 million and have $75 million, $80 million of gain to deal with. And so, not a lot of cash flow there either after needed distributions. So, I\u2019ll tell you, Nick, when we see our stock price when it\u2019s trading at such a material discount to NAV like it is now as, is a signal not to use the equity markets to fund growth. That\u2019s what we see it as. And that\u2019s very clear to us. But we do talk to the Board about buybacks periodically, and it\u2019s not like sort of categorically off the table. But again, it\u2019s more of a financial maneuver. And if you don\u2019t do it in size, it\u2019s not terribly meaningful. And the last comment is I\u2019ve watched a lot of REITs buy back meaningful amounts of stock usually away from our sector. And it hasn\u2019t proven to have turned out all that well. I think it\u2019s better used as an indicator of when not to issue equity than it is to go whole hog on some giant share buyback.\nNick Yulico: Okay. I appreciate your thoughts there, Mark. Second question is just, I think -- if I think about multifamily, your company, the whole sector right now, I think there\u2019s, at some point, this worry that it\u2019s not so much a 2023 issue relative to guidance. But at some point, if we have a recession over the next year or so, there\u2019s going to be an impact, right? And it\u2019s going to impact the rents and occupancy and revenue. And so, what I\u2019m trying to figure out is, last two recessions were very unusual in terms of the impacts we had to multifamily. How are you guys thinking about -- is there any way -- this is a tough question, but is there any way to think about a downside impact to your company in what is a maybe more normalized recession and sort of an order of magnitude of -- or how much rents could correct or how much revenue or NOI could correct?\nMark Parrell: Yes. I guess I\u2019d just make a few comments on that. Obviously, my crystal ball is as blurry as yours. I mean, a lot of these other recent recessions, there were huge excesses in the economy or like the pandemic, just a panic, as you mentioned, that just made the whole thing very unusual. I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re terribly out of whack. So, it feels to me like any recession that occurs, it will be more like a slowdown in jobs as opposed to some, we are putting out negative 400,000 jobs a month type numbers. So I feel like if 2024 comes around, the business will perform relatively well and certainly better than the last downturn or so. I also think you got to compare it to what else is going on in the economy. We\u2019ve typically been a pretty good inflation hedge. We put materials in our book about that. So, if you think you\u2019re going to have a slowdown in the economy, and you\u2019re going to continue to have some inflation, I mean typically, our business has been able to raise rents in excess of the inflation rate in our kind of business. And Michael and his team do a great job of managing expenses. So, I look at it and I think in a slow growth economy, maybe with a little bit of inflation, I think we can still do on a relative basis really well at our company because, again, we manage expenses well. I think the next recession, if there is one late this year or next is I do agree likely to be less about excesses and dramatic type downturns and a little more gradual. And I think our numbers will reflect that. But boy, it\u2019s really hard to predict, and nobody knows for sure, right?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Mark, definitely seems like between the bookies making bets on the Super Bowl, we could have the same bet here on whether or not this recession has been affected summer leasing. So certainly a topic we\u2019re all watching. Two questions here. The first question is a lot of regulatory focus recently, the White House, obviously, on fee income, President mentioned it as far as hotels go in the State of the Union. But more importantly, apartments are under a lot of regulations already. So, as you guys think about your fee income that you charge, your new lease fees, the pet fees and all that stuff, as you guys look through all that, do you feel comfortable with where you are? And you\u2019re like, look, we already abide by all the regulations, all the stuff is covered, or is there a concern that the regulators could push harder on some of these line items?\nMark Parrell: Well, I\u2019m going to split that question up. If you\u2019re asking whether we think we comply with the law right now, we think we do. We\u2019ve done extensive reviews on that because we feel like you do, there\u2019s more regulatory sensitivity. A lot of these rules, by the way, are very complex or very judgmental. They may say you can\u2019t charge unfair fees and things like that that are harder for us to peg. But the legal team has worked really hard with operations to make sure what we\u2019re doing right now makes a ton of sense. Either Michael or Bob could talk about what percent of total revenues are the kinds of fees you\u2019re talking about. I think it\u2019s 3% in that neighborhood. So it\u2019s meaningful, and it can grow faster than the remainder of the portfolio. But if we had to moderate it, we\u2019ll deal with it. But again, things like pet fees, I mean, pets create real cost to the property. I mean the cleaning costs are much higher. So in some cases, these are profit and in some cases, these are just additional costs that will come into the system one way or another. So on the regulatory front, we\u2019re just going to have good conversations with all these regulators about all this stuff. A lot of this is not thoughtful and it\u2019s going to discourage capital going into residential and isn\u2019t going to help with the shortage of affordable housing. So, we\u2019re going to push that line more and more and keep having that kind of conversation. But on the fee side, it\u2019s really that material to us, it\u2019s just not a good idea. It\u2019s another one of those sort of why shouldn\u2019t the cost of someone\u2019s pet be borne by the pet owner as opposed to borne by the entire complex, for example.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. No, makes sense. And then second question is, the recent L.A. good cause eviction, one of the items, if I read it correctly, was that basically a tenant cannot pay a month and be fine and not be deemed to be in arrears or anything. Is this the correct understanding? And if so, is that -- does that mean that in L.A. county and hopefully -- not hopefully, and unfortunately, if other markets adopt this, that bad debt could now seem to be the sort of elevated thing versus historic? Or is there a way for landlords to make sure that someone just isn\u2019t getting a free month for no reason other than they can get a free month?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks for that question. I don\u2019t have that right in front of me. I did read the sort of general idea that there is a permissible amount of default -- defaulted debt that a resident could have. But again, our rents on average approach $3,000, in that market a little bit lower, but they\u2019re significant. So if it was a dollar limit -- gosh, I thought, Alex, it was a dollar limit, not a month\u2019s rent limit, but I\u2019d have to look into that, we\u2019d have to have another conversation. But I think the theme here is the more you regulate things like this, the less capital that will go into the industry, to renovate properties or to create more housing. And it\u2019s just a bad idea, and we\u2019ve got a really good team that\u2019s pushing this. And people hear us. When you talked about the administration, I mean, the Biden administration\u2019s Build Back Better Act had some terrific stuff about zoning flexibility and encouraging at localities. The Governor of California and the Governor of New York have been pushing supply and more units being built and trying to work with the industry, both on the for sale and rental side. So I think there are people listening to us. It\u2019s just we got to keep it up because a lot of the ideas you mentioned are just not constructive.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Sam Cho [ph] with Credit Suisse.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys. I\u2019m on for Tayo today. Thank you for keeping the cal going. So, I know -- I think it was one of my former colleagues that asked about, I guess, the supply pressure. But can you remind us how you guys go about judging the threat from new competition and how that kind of -- and how that factors into portfolio exposure? Because just from our end, it\u2019s really hard to see that. So kind of understanding your qualitative or quantitative metrics to frame out how you guys judge that threat factor would be interesting to hear from our standpoint.\nAlec Brackenridge: Hey Sam, it\u2019s Alec. And yes, we do spend a lot of time looking at supply, and as Michael mentioned earlier, focusing on the proximity of the supply to our properties. And we find that\u2019s where we\u2019ve really gotten the pressure on our ability to grow rents. And it depends where we are. In Manhattan, proximate supply is a lot tighter than, say, in California. So we adjust for that. And what we\u2019ve seen going from -- and again, this is our property and proximity -- our portfolio and proximity to our properties is in 2022, there was supply that was proximate to us like 110,000 units, and it\u2019s going down quite a bit from there. And the average in the past was around -- I\u2019m sorry, 86,000 units are going down quite a bit from there. So we\u2019re seeing a lot less immediate supply, and the way we measure it has more to do with that proximity than that market level as a whole.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I think the one thing I\u2019d add -- this is Michael. I could just add one thing. In like markets like D.C., we have found that because there\u2019s such good transit, like that mile radius doesn\u2019t hold as well. So we would say that we\u2019re going to cast a much wider net and assume that people will move between markets, between some markets just because of that transit. So, every market has like a rule of thumb that we use, and then we drill in and go deep with the investment officers doing their drive buys and given their input, and then the property management team is weighing in, and we ultimately get to this consensus view. And we\u2019ve been doing this way for a long time, and it seems to really hold true. What we have found like in \u201821 and \u201822 that even with elevated supply right on top of us, if the inbound demand is so strong, it doesn\u2019t matter. So, that\u2019s why that absorption rate matters.\nUnidentified Analyst: That\u2019s really helpful color. And then, one more for me. You touched on overall concession still being pretty elevated. So, I know all recessions are not created equal. But from a historical context, how have concession strategies looked during spring leasing season during a recession? And whether we can draw any lessons from the past to imply what could happen if things go sour? Thank you.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So, this is Michael. That\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know if I have that in front of me to look at what the concession dollars were back across the previous recession periods or by quarter to understand the seasonality of them. I guess, what I would look at is just -- it\u2019s very common to see concessions in the stabilized portfolios in the shoulder period that are used in a very strategic basis to really hold up base rent. And when you see it spread where -- like we\u2019ve seen in some of the urban cores of Seattle and San Francisco, where 60%, 70% of the properties that we compete against are offering some form of concession, that is a signal, right, of something in that market. Now, the good news, like I said, is we\u2019re seeing it dial back. And clearly, we\u2019re seeing demand softening. You wouldn\u2019t feel a dial back in that concession amount. So, how you would frame the spring? Right now, I guess I would tell you, I would expect concessions will continue to dial back, both in volume and dollars. But obviously, if you hit like a pretty significant recession period, maybe they sustain and hold at this level. It\u2019s hard for me to say that.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Ami Probandt from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAmi Probandt: Thanks. The first round of requirements for compliance with the Local Law 97 in New York City are scheduled to take effect in 2024. Do you have any estimates on the impact for your portfolio?\nAlec Brackenridge: Hi Ami, it\u2019s Alec. We\u2019ve looked at that, and we don\u2019t have an impact right now. We can reach those thresholds. It gets challenging, as you know, over time and \u201823 is another benchmark year, and we\u2019re working towards that as well. So, so far so good, but it\u2019s certainly to get more owners over time.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark Parrell for closing statements.\nMark Parrell: Well, we\u2019re excited, as you can tell from the call about our 2023 prospects, the Company\u2019s long-term positioning, and we\u2019re looking forward to delivering a really good 2023. So, thank you all for your time today and your interest in Equity Residential.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everybody for joining us today. This morning, I will review key takeaways from our fourth quarter 2022 performance, expectations for 2023 and provide some color on the markets before I turn it over to Bob to walk through our financial guidance. 2022 same-store revenue growth of 10.6% was the best in EQR's history of nearly 30 years as a public company. Reported turnover for both the full year and the fourth quarter was the lowest in the Company's history, reflecting great demand that produced high occupancy and significant pricing power. In most of our markets, we had a supercharged spring leasing season with more robust pricing power that started earlier than usual in the year. Rents peaked in August, which is typical and then started to seasonally moderate, which is also typical. The seasonal moderation was a little more pronounced than we originally expected and likely due to a combination of rents reaching such a high peak, along with less pricing power than expected as we ended the year. Given current uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, this moderation isn't surprising, though the January employment report that Mark just mentioned was very encouraging. Sitting here today, we have good occupancy with solid demand across our markets. Our dashboards and current leasing momentum continue to signal a normal spring. Let me take a minute and walk through the building blocks of our guidance range of 4.5% to 6% revenue growth. This is an updated look to what we provided in our third quarter management presentation. So first, we start with an embedded growth of 4.2% for 2023. This is slightly below the midpoint of the range we talked about in the third quarter of 4% to 5%, but mostly consistent with expectations and takes into account the additional concessions used in the fourth quarter. Next, we expect strong occupancy for 2023 at 96.2% which includes a continuation of low resident turnover but is 20 basis points lower than that of 2022. Finally, we're assuming blended rates in 2023 will average approximately 4% for the full year. This assumption incorporates capturing our 1.5% loss to lease along with approximately 2.5% intraperiod growth in rates. This intraperiod growth assumes a positive impact from less overall pressure from competitive new supply and acknowledges some potential headwinds for a softening economy. For your reference, in a normal non-recessionary year, we would expect intraperiod growth to be about 3% to 3.5% with us capturing about half of that gain in same-store revenue. The first half of 2023 will benefit from the momentum we had last year, while the back half of the year faces tougher comps and could feel the impact of the economy, as the year progresses. The contribution of this blended rate growth to revenue will be approximately half, as we capture it over the 2023 leasing season. Add all of that up and the implication is revenue growth over 6%, which would be exceptional after a remarkable 2022. The midpoint of our guidance range however is 5.25%, which is lower because we do not expect bad debt net to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, and it continues to work against us this year, due to a lack of expected government rental assistance and the extension of the eviction moratoriums in both LA and Alameda counties. Bob will go into more detail on bad debt net, including our assumption in his prepared remarks. The outlook I just described is based on a belief that, while the economy may be slowing, our business continues to demonstrate a number of favorable drivers and resiliency. As we have often said in the past, we focus on our dashboards while also acknowledging the headlines. While keeping in mind that this is very early in the year, when we look at our dashboards today, the portfolio is demonstrating sequential improvement in both pricing trends and application volume, as we would expect, which by all indications is a typical pre-pandemic setup for the spring leasing season. New York and Boston will be two of our top performers in 2023, after delivering strong results in 2022. In San Francisco and Seattle, we are seeing good demand and sequential improvement in pricing with slight reductions in both the quantity and value of concessions being offered since the beginning of the year. Even with this modest improvement, the overall level of concessions are still elevated, resulting in weaker-than-anticipated pricing power. San Francisco and Seattle have been slower to recover than the other markets, but both posted really good revenue growth in 2022. Both cities have been balancing a combination of quality of life issues in their downtown, which are getting better and a delayed return to the office from large tech employers. In addition, there have been some layoff announcements from companies based in these two cities. These layoffs are a direct result of excessive hiring during the pandemic. This excess was spread across multiple markets and countries, not just Seattle and San Francisco. The remote nature of work in tech during the pandemic along with these hiring sprees, likely means that the layoffs are more geographically dispersed than in prior periods. Both of these cities remain hubs of the tech industry and share an entrepreneurial spirit that will continue to incubate the next big idea, be it AI or other innovations we find changing our lives a decade from now. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes that these markets continue to improve modestly as we get into the spring leasing season but overall weakness persists, which is why our intraperiod growth assumptions for the company overall are somewhat lower than the typical 3% to 3.5% range. If San Francisco and Seattle get some traction this year, that could have a significant positive impact on our same-store revenue growth as could a more rapid improvement in bad debt net, leading us to the higher end of our range. Reaching the bottom end of our range would require either rate growth to slow much earlier in the year than expected or occupancy to dip to the mid-95% range for a sustained period of time. And lastly, before I turn it over to Bob to discuss our guidance, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation. On the revenue side, we will continue to focus on other income items like Wi-Fi, parking and amenity rate optimization. We will also leverage data and analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margin. We have been a sector leader in limiting same store expense growth, and this is attributable to our team's willingness to embrace innovation and initiatives focused on centralized activities. We are driven to get the most out of the portfolio and continue to have great success in creating efficiencies in our sales and office functions. In 2023, we will complete the centralization of onsite activities such as application processing, and our move-out and collection process. On the service side, we will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create more opportunities to share our resources across multiple properties. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to the residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that I will turn the call over to Bob. Yes. Hey Nick, this is Michael. So first, I guess, I would say back in the November management presentation, we highlighted this whole technology evolution of our platform. That really has been focused on creating this mobility and efficiency in the operating model. And clearly, for the last couple of years, it's been more expense-focused and that shows up in the numbers that we just talked about. Specific to 2023, I think we've included just over $10 million in the guidance with still about two-thirds of that benefit on the expense front, and that's spread out across a couple of various accounts in repair and maintenance, along with the payroll accounts. And the revenue impact is several million dollars in \u201823. But for us, it's probably going to kick in more in the back half of the year and really start to show up in 2024 as a lot of these initiatives we have don't get put into place until kind of the middle of the year. We got a lot of different pilots going on right now with like short-term and common area rentals, the property wide Wi-Fi. We've got another 25,000 units being installed with the smart home. And again, most of this is going to contribute probably to the other income line. And I think you see about 20 or 30 basis-point growth in that number for 2023. And I'll tell you, we're excited about all of this stuff. We're going to continue to kind of look at the way we've been doing this in the past, which is areas that are capital intensive. And the technology is like first gen. We're -- that signals to us that it's okay to be a fast follower in that area, similar to like how we approach the smart home installations and for us, we just want to make sure that we're going to get the appropriate return on this stuff. So, I think right now, the foundation is almost in place. By the middle of the year, we'll have kind of most of the operating platform where we need it to be to capture that benefit. And I think you should expect the $30 million to $35 million that we outlined in that presentation really to start shifting more towards that revenue front in \u201824 and \u201825. But at the end of the day, the reality is you're never done with this pursuit of operational excellence, and it's something that's clearly wired into the DNA of our company. Yes. So again, for us, we're very focused, right, on this proximity of the supply, when are the first units going to hit the market. And specific to the \u201823 deliveries, it's pretty clear to us across our portfolio that we're going to feel less overall direct pressure like from it. What we've been watching is in the fourth quarter, which is really a bad time to watch for concession change because you typically see concessions inch up but in many of the markets, you're seeing that the new supply did absolutely grow their concessions compared to the third quarter and tend to be in that 6- to 8-week range. What's promising for us right now is that we did see, just like in the stabilized portfolio, starting the year in January, starting to see these concessions kind of fall back a little bit in the volume of the concessions that are being issued as well as the value of them. So for us right now, I'll tell you that we're still focused in San Francisco and Seattle is where we see the heaviest concentration of supply of concessions being used. And it's about 25% of our applications in San Francisco are receiving about two weeks. And then in Seattle, we have about 40% of applications receiving one month. And if you put kind of all of that into the blender and you think about like 2023 and our expectations, right now in our portfolio, we kind of normalize concessions to the 2022 level, so we expect to continue to see some elevated concessions in the shoulder periods. And it's hard to say what's going to happen with the new supply across the market. It's clearly something we're going to be watching. Yes. Hi Chandni, this is Michael. So, I think in both of those areas, clearly, you saw more of the concession use in the fourth quarter concentrated into those urban cores of those markets. The demand is there across urban, suburban across all of the submarkets. It just got a little bit more price sensitivity to it. And clearly, I think the urban still has more pronounced price sensitivity than the suburban areas. And we haven't really seen any change. Like in the demand profile coming in, we haven't seen any shifts like going urban or suburban in those markets, the profile seems very similar to what we are typically used to kind of seeing in the market. And right now, I guess I would tell you, when we look at these January stats and we think about the sequential improvement that we're seeing over kind of the December numbers, those urban markets are actually kind of growing at a pace a little bit faster than the suburban and probably because we're pulling back on the concession, right? So, when we think about that, you can see you pull back a couple of weeks on a concession, that's like a 4% change in pricing right off the bat. So, no real signals yet to any significant change other than what we have felt, which is the urban cores, which by the way, do feel better from a quality of life. You could see the efforts that are being placed in both of these cities right now on it. You can feel the improvement there. But you still just have more pronounced price sensitivity in those urban areas. Yes. So Steve, this is Michael. So I guess, I would say that we started this back in kind of the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter, just really kind of tracking that like going deeper on reasons for move out, if people said job change, to understand it. And we are talking like less than a dozen. And when you say concentrated, I mean, it's such a small number, but it really is spread only in the Seattle and San Francisco market. And I think the teams, if you went across the country would say we always have one or two that come in and say that they lost their job and they're leaving, and that's why. So we really haven't seen anything. And clearly, there's some conversations when you get into the renewals with some folks that they tell us that they're changing jobs or that they lost their job. But in the concentrations of Seattle and San Francisco, it doesn't feel like they're overly concerned that they're not going to be gainfully employed, quickly. Yes. Hey Adam, it's Michael. So, I think what I would look to is one, the sequential comment I was referring to is December to January, not like when you're looking into the release, the fourth quarter to January numbers. So, when you think about occupancy, our occupancy actually held flat, right? We were, I think, 95.8% in December; we're 95.8% or 95.9% for January. And so, I look at that and say, as you think about returning to normal seasonality, it is very common for occupancy to trade down into that fourth quarter. So what we saw is that pattern kind of emerge. And outside of some of the pricing pressure that I described, some of the additional concessions, the way that the rents moderated is very consistent with what you would expect. That being said, you turn the corner and you get into January, what we normally would see in January is right after that new year, you see sequential improvement every week in application volume and rents ticking up and we got a little bit of an accelerant, like I said, in the urban because we started pulling back concessions when we saw that inbound demand doing what you would expect it to do. Now, what's interesting is like the cold weather climates like Boston and New York, they kind of tend to stall in February. You get a little bit of a boost in Jan and then it stalls and then you hit March and then you're kind of off to the races for the spring leasing season. So, I think my commentary was just pointing to you if I went back and looked at \u201818, \u201819, any of these years, the trends that we're seeing today, and again, we're five weeks into the year or something like that is very consistent with a normal year, which would tell us you would expect a normal spring leasing season. Yes. Hey. This is Michael. So I think the way to think about the modeling of what a normal curve would look like is what we will see right now is new lease change will start to sequentially grow and typically will max out somewhere in that third quarter and then will seasonally moderate as you get to the year. For our assumption of this blended rate of 4, we basically are assuming about 2 -- a little over like 2.25% in new lease change across the whole year but it is -- it's kind of like a bell curve. We're going to work our way through the spring and keep building it and then we're going to let it moderate. When you think about renewals right now, on capturing some of the loss to lease, we have some pretty good numbers at a 6.9% achieved renewal increase in January. Our expectation, and I've got these quotes out for the next 90 days, we're going to stay somewhere in this 5% to 6% range in this first half of the year. And then I would expect that number to moderate like it would normally do into like a 4% to 5% range in the back half of the year. So, on a full like likely guidance model that puts renewals somewhere just north of 5% and when you put those two together and you think about the retention factor, it winds up getting you to that blended rate of about 4%. Yes. Well, maybe I'll just kind of bucket the markets around. So I think I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, New York, we expect it to be our best performing market followed very closely by Boston and then really close by San Diego and Orange County as well. I'm going to put aside L.A. and San Francisco for a moment because of the bad debt implications. But if you really looked at all of our other markets, you could almost bucket them in this 4.5% to 5% kind of revenue growth range for 2023. And then you get into the San Francisco and L.A. that has the bad debt impact. Without it, both of those markets would be in this 4.5% to 5% range as well. But with it, San Francisco, right now, we're forecasting around just under a 3.5% growth and L.A. is just north of a 1.5% growth. Yes. And I think, Jeff, the only thing I would add to that is clearly, you're going to try to maximize rate and you're going to see whether or not you're getting that corresponding closing rate or the application volume that you need based on how many units you have to sell. And that's typically what we're looking at week in, week out, which is that ratio, and then we're making decisions whether or not we're leaning in on rate or kind of letting the rates soften a little bit and kind of position ourselves differently. But, on top of just that feel that you have, we're watching these demographic changes, the income ratios, I think Mark alluded to before, we're hyper focused on transfer activity, are they moving up in size, down in size, what are they doing, roommate activity. And then, of course, we're watching that new supply in these markets. And that concession volume that they're issuing is a signal to us whether or not they're getting the velocity they need because that absorption rate of that supply is going to tell us whether we're going to feel more or less pressure from it. Yes. I think the one thing I'd add -- this is Michael. I could just add one thing. In like markets like D.C., we have found that because there's such good transit, like that mile radius doesn't hold as well. So we would say that we're going to cast a much wider net and assume that people will move between markets, between some markets just because of that transit. So, every market has like a rule of thumb that we use, and then we drill in and go deep with the investment officers doing their drive buys and given their input, and then the property management team is weighing in, and we ultimately get to this consensus view. And we've been doing this way for a long time, and it seems to really hold true. What we have found like in \u201821 and \u201822 that even with elevated supply right on top of us, if the inbound demand is so strong, it doesn't matter. So, that's why that absorption rate matters. Yes. So, this is Michael. That's -- I don't know if I have that in front of me to look at what the concession dollars were back across the previous recession periods or by quarter to understand the seasonality of them. I guess, what I would look at is just -- it's very common to see concessions in the stabilized portfolios in the shoulder period that are used in a very strategic basis to really hold up base rent. And when you see it spread where -- like we've seen in some of the urban cores of Seattle and San Francisco, where 60%, 70% of the properties that we compete against are offering some form of concession, that is a signal, right, of something in that market. Now, the good news, like I said, is we're seeing it dial back. And clearly, we're seeing demand softening. You wouldn't feel a dial back in that concession amount. So, how you would frame the spring? Right now, I guess I would tell you, I would expect concessions will continue to dial back, both in volume and dollars. But obviously, if you hit like a pretty significant recession period, maybe they sustain and hold at this level. It's hard for me to say that."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thanks Marty. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and our outlook for 2023. 2022 was a terrific year for Equity Residential. We finished the year, as we expected, producing same-store revenue growth of 10.6%. We continued to see good demand during the fourth quarter, but certainly saw a return of seasonality to the business. Our strong 2022 same-store revenue growth combined with modest expense growth of 3.6% resulted in same-store net operating income growth for the full year of 14.1%. With continuing positive financial leverage, this led to a 17.7% increase in year-over-year normalized FFO. I want to take a moment, thank all my colleagues across Equity Residential for their hard work and dedication in delivering these terrific results. In a moment, Michael Manelis will take you through our 2022 highlights and how we expect 2023 to shape up on the revenue side; and Bob Garechana will comment on bad debt and review our 2022 expense results and 2023 expense expectations, as well as recent balance sheet activities and then we will take your questions. We have provided guidance for same-store revenue growth at a midpoint of 5.25%, which would make 2023 another good year for Equity Residential and produce same-store revenue growth well above our long-term average. We do admit to finding 2023 harder to predict than usual. On the positive side, we go into the year, expecting a benefit from embedded growth of about 4.2% from leases written in 2022 and we also carry into the year and above average loss to lease, both of which will contribute to positive momentum for us, particularly in the first half of 2023. We also feel good about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. There still appears to be plentiful employment opportunities for the highly skilled workers that formed the bulk of our residents as evidenced by last week's blowout January employment and job openings reports. We saw big increases in employment in the professional and business services category, a smaller gain in financial activities and only a modest decline in information services, all big employment categories for our residents. So far the announced layoffs at tech and some financial firms while certainly creating a negative environment have not manifested themselves much in the government's reported numbers, or thus far in our internal numbers. We've only seen a handful of residents terminating leases early due to job loss. Possibly the impact is delayed due to severance and other factors. But it is at least equally possible that the workers in these categories are being quickly reabsorbed into the job market. Our renter demographic has proven resilient in the past, and we expect them to continue to be highly employable. As to renter incomes, according to the Atlanta Fed wage tracker, college graduates wages accelerated in the fourth quarter, outpacing wage gains achieved by hourly workers despite the higher base. Looking at competition from home ownership and new apartment supply in 2023, we also generally see a favorable picture. Homeownership costs and down-payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making our product to better value. According to the National Association of Realtors, for their affordability index to return to pre-COVID levels, one of three things will need to occur: The 30-year mortgage rate will need to decline to 2.6%; home prices to fall by 1/3, our family incomes to increase by 50%. This is all very consistent with our internal data, which shows the percentage of residents leaving us to purchase a home fell to 9.4% in the fourth quarter from 15.8% a year ago. On the apartment supply side, we expect 2023 national new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the direct level of competition that we will face given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties. The Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets, in which we are increasingly investing and Denver, will see higher relative supply numbers in our coastal established markets and likely more impact, especially if that's coupled with a job slowdown. In terms of supply in our coastal established markets, where we still have 95% of our properties. Our internal research indicates that new apartments delivered near to our properties create significantly more short-term pressure on our results. As we look at 2023's expected deliveries through that lens, new supply within close proximity to our properties in our coastal established markets is actually forecasted to be below pre-pandemic levels with only the Washington D.C. and Orange County market screening as delivering above average supply close to our properties relative to these pre-pandemic supply averages. And over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across the country sets us up for good long-term demand. We do, however, fully acknowledge that despite what was good GDP growth in the fourth quarter and full year and continuing strong employment reports, the Federal Reserve's rate actions are likely to pressure job growth and economic growth as 2023 progresses. We took this into account in our guidance by assuming a lower rate of rental rate growth during 2023 than usual and a decline in occupancy. But whether there is or isn't a technical recession is of considerably less importance to us than whether job growth substantially declines and if so when. A decline at the beginning of our spring leasing season will be considerably more impactful than a slowdown later in the year. We also now expect that the elevated post-pandemic level of bad debt in some of our California markets does improve in \u201823 but at a slower rate than we previously hoped, as poor public policies encouraging delinquency continue. Bob will discuss all this in a moment. In sum, we make no prediction about a recession but have assumed some impact to our 2023 results from a job slowdown and flawed government policy and evictions, while continuing to see sources of strength in our business in the form of modest forward competition from home purchases and new apartment supply, the high employment ability of our residents even if the job market deteriorates from its current lofty levels, and the positive forward momentum from our strong 2022 results. On the transaction front, there was not much activity in 2022 for us. We only purchased one deal and we sold three others, two in New York City and one in Washington D.C. We did start a handful of new developments. These were mostly in our Toll joint venture structure. As we head into 2023, the transaction markets remain unsettled, but we see higher than usual supply in the Sunbelt and Denver markets in which we wish to expand as hopefully creating buying opportunities for us later in the year. For now, our guidance does not assume any acquisition or disposition activity, but remain committed to our strategy of shifting capital out of California, New York and Washington D.C., and into our expansion markets of Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta, as well as the suburbs and markets like Seattle and Boston, assuming appropriate opportunities present themselves. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Hey John, it's Mark. Just to contribute to that, because it's hard to number order it, like you said, but it's easy to think about what it costs to wait. So that option a seller has is costly because SOFR, which is now the new index rate is 4.5%. So you figure -- if you have a development loan, you're 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points above that. So you're somewhere at 7% to 8%, 8.5%, that's expensive debt to be sitting around hoping for an improvement. Meantime, the preferential rate on your equity is likely something like 8% as well. So I do think, as Alec said, unlike in the past, that option cost of waiting is more expensive for the seller than it's typically been. And these caps -- again, a lot of these caps were struck at 4% or 5%, they're deeply in the money now. So I mean, clearly, the price of a cap that a lender would require you to get is going to be very expensive. So, I think those are significant pressures. The private REITs are out there. We see product. And again, not all of it's suited to us. They have other levers they can pull as well. But I think you'll see more from them through the year as well. But we don't see a panic sale market at all. We just expect people to sort of capitulate and just say it isn't going all the way back to 3.5 cap rates in the next six months, so we're going to go and sell at the market price, whether that's high-4s, low-5s, medium-5s will -- yet to be determined. Yes. Hey Chandni, it's Mark. We don't look at job forecast -- national job forecast, especially as particularly relevant to our numbers. We do focus a little more on the bottom up. We do spend time and we've done the regression analysis and a lot of the work to try and understand how different variables, job growth, like foremost and household income among them, impact our numbers in the near term. And so we do kind of gut check what comes out of the bottom-up process with our perspective from the top down, both in terms of numbers that your firm and others put out there as potential forecast. But we don't have a model that we would rely on that would spit out numbers. I think there's just too many variables. We back tested lots of those models. And I'll tell you, we don't have confidence than that system being a better one than looking at it from the bottom up, feeling your market, understanding local drivers of employment, local supply and sort of thinking about your business that way, has proven to us to be much more reliable. So, we feel really good, though, about job growth in our markets generally. I mean, the employment report last week was terrific. Our residents, as I said in my remarks, they found work when they've lost their positions. And it's been a very small number of people, literally handfuls that have handed us their keys. So, this is -- if this is a recession, it's the best one we've ever been to. And it's going pretty well for us so far. So, I don't have anything to share with you in terms of top-down job forecast inputs. And Steve, it's Mark. Just to supplement on that just a bit. Our transfers are low, too. So sometimes you'll see people going down to a cheaper unit and things like that that can also be an indicator of stress. We don't see that in any meaningful size. And we did a little research, I want to share. We asked our folks in markets like San Francisco, Seattle, New York. When a local firm announces a layoff, then tracking that either using the filings, and I believe you do something similar, using the various governmental filings or some of the layoffs, dot, whatever websites and what we're seeing is just like these tech jobs and a lot of these financial jobs were spread over the whole country of late, these layoffs are spread over the whole country. So generally, we've seen a Bay Area company or a Seattle company announced layoffs, 20% to 30% of those are in that home market and the rest are spread all over the country. So I think what you and I, right, recall from \u201801 where if you had a tech layoff in San Francisco, that person was definitively in San Francisco, I think it's much more diffused now, and it's just a different sort of employment picture than it was in the past. Yes. Thanks for that question, Adam. We have a terrific development team, both the in-house team that started and built $400 million towers as well as much smaller projects. And then we've got the JV with Toll and others. So, we think development is a nice complement to our acquisitions, particularly in these expansion markets. The instruction that Alec and I have sort of given both our outside partners as well as our internal teams is find things that you can work on for the next few months that we can start late this year and sometime next. Maybe the capital will be a little more reasonable, maybe the underwriting will be a little bit better, maybe the cost structure will make a little more sense. And so, let's be thoughtful about starting a lot right now where you really feel like your opportunity is likely to be in the acquisition market. But we'd love to tactically start. We've got a few things already in the sort of inventory we'd like to do, but it's just got to make sense. I mean, we're just not going to plow ahead and put our shareholders' money into a development deal if acquisition is a cheaper alternative or if just the costs and the risks involved are too significant. So to answer your question about development, it's very important to us. We don't have any starts really in the budget for this year. But just like acquisitions, we don't have any of those either. But we're happy to do plenty of them. Bob commented on the balance sheet strength. I think the debt markets would support a big EQR issuance to fund either of those, if we thought that was a good idea. So, we'll just keep watching it closely. And if there's something that comes there on the development side, like I said, we got the internal team, we got the Toll folks, we've got others. I mean we can put that into gear. But we're happy to have it at zero, too, if that's the right decision for the shareholders. Hey Jeff, it's Mark. I'm going to start. I'm going to turn it over to Michael. I mean, we're lucky to have a very experienced team here and -- both here in Chicago and then across the country, and a great system for feeling the markets. So, when we start seeing a market improve, when we start seeing a market deteriorate, we can react -- or frankly, a submarket or an asset, we react in real time. We don't wait for macroeconomic data. So, we're certainly aware of what's going on. We watch all those employment reports keenly. But I think we're ahead of that. I think we feel that in our leasing in advance. Because again, if someone lost the job and they immediately got a new one, the government's data may take some time to show that. The unemployment reports have been really good. So I guess I would say, as we go through the year, we're going to depend on Michael and his team, and he can elaborate on that in a minute. I have a great revenue management process, great communication on site to sort of see what's going on in real time and adjust in real time. Yes. Just to add one last thought. It's Mark again. I mean, we do think about overarching themes. I mean, Michael has been running the business ever since the economy started to feel a little shakier, with a focus on occupancy and retention. He's opened up some of his renewal ranges. So, we do -- macroeconomics and what we feel in the general U.S. economy does inform some of these leans but we're quick to learn from what's going on on-site, and that's more important to us than any set of numbers coming from anywhere else. So I'll also tell you in places like New York and Boston, we feel so good about the supply picture and heretofore the jobs picture that those markets are places where our lean will be more aggressive than a place where we might have more anxiety like downtown San Francisco or downtown Seattle. So, we do inform some of those decisions, Jeff, with the big picture. But again, we like to watch what's going on property by property. Again, where's the recession and what part of the economy? And I guess, I'd say if we get through the bulk of the leasing season into July and August and the job numbers are still pretty good and unemployment claims are still pretty low, then I'm very much of the mindset that we'll have a really good year. If you start to feel those numbers roll over in March, then the year for us and everybody else in the apartment industry is going to feel a little different. Yes. Thanks for that question, Nick. I mean, we've had versions of this conversation before. The unique thing about a stock buyback versus some of the other investments we make is it has both a capital allocation and a capital structure impact. I mean, we don't retain a whole heck of a lot of cash flow after CapEx because we're a REIT, and we have to distribute all our income. So, we look at it, it's either incurring a whole -- I mean to make a meaningful impact on a company our size, you have to incur a meaningful amount of debt and go out there. And we can do that. We've got space for that right now. But you can only do that one time before you've affected your ratings, you've affected your multiple. We all learned in business school, riskier businesses with more debt, have less multiples, lower multiples. So, the debt side is possible, but it has offsets and is risk. And I also tell you on your asset sales, I mean, Alec and his team have bought well over the years. We've done a lot of 1031s. So, there's a lot of embedded gains. You might sell an asset for $100 million and have $75 million, $80 million of gain to deal with. And so, not a lot of cash flow there either after needed distributions. So, I'll tell you, Nick, when we see our stock price when it's trading at such a material discount to NAV like it is now as, is a signal not to use the equity markets to fund growth. That's what we see it as. And that's very clear to us. But we do talk to the Board about buybacks periodically, and it's not like sort of categorically off the table. But again, it's more of a financial maneuver. And if you don't do it in size, it's not terribly meaningful. And the last comment is I've watched a lot of REITs buy back meaningful amounts of stock usually away from our sector. And it hasn't proven to have turned out all that well. I think it's better used as an indicator of when not to issue equity than it is to go whole hog on some giant share buyback. Yes. I guess I'd just make a few comments on that. Obviously, my crystal ball is as blurry as yours. I mean, a lot of these other recent recessions, there were huge excesses in the economy or like the pandemic, just a panic, as you mentioned, that just made the whole thing very unusual. I don't feel like we're terribly out of whack. So, it feels to me like any recession that occurs, it will be more like a slowdown in jobs as opposed to some, we are putting out negative 400,000 jobs a month type numbers. So I feel like if 2024 comes around, the business will perform relatively well and certainly better than the last downturn or so. I also think you got to compare it to what else is going on in the economy. We've typically been a pretty good inflation hedge. We put materials in our book about that. So, if you think you're going to have a slowdown in the economy, and you're going to continue to have some inflation, I mean typically, our business has been able to raise rents in excess of the inflation rate in our kind of business. And Michael and his team do a great job of managing expenses. So, I look at it and I think in a slow growth economy, maybe with a little bit of inflation, I think we can still do on a relative basis really well at our company because, again, we manage expenses well. I think the next recession, if there is one late this year or next is I do agree likely to be less about excesses and dramatic type downturns and a little more gradual. And I think our numbers will reflect that. But boy, it's really hard to predict, and nobody knows for sure, right? Well, I'm going to split that question up. If you're asking whether we think we comply with the law right now, we think we do. We've done extensive reviews on that because we feel like you do, there's more regulatory sensitivity. A lot of these rules, by the way, are very complex or very judgmental. They may say you can't charge unfair fees and things like that that are harder for us to peg. But the legal team has worked really hard with operations to make sure what we're doing right now makes a ton of sense. Either Michael or Bob could talk about what percent of total revenues are the kinds of fees you're talking about. I think it's 3% in that neighborhood. So it's meaningful, and it can grow faster than the remainder of the portfolio. But if we had to moderate it, we'll deal with it. But again, things like pet fees, I mean, pets create real cost to the property. I mean the cleaning costs are much higher. So in some cases, these are profit and in some cases, these are just additional costs that will come into the system one way or another. So on the regulatory front, we're just going to have good conversations with all these regulators about all this stuff. A lot of this is not thoughtful and it's going to discourage capital going into residential and isn't going to help with the shortage of affordable housing. So, we're going to push that line more and more and keep having that kind of conversation. But on the fee side, it's really that material to us, it's just not a good idea. It's another one of those sort of why shouldn't the cost of someone's pet be borne by the pet owner as opposed to borne by the entire complex, for example. Yes. Thanks for that question. I don't have that right in front of me. I did read the sort of general idea that there is a permissible amount of default -- defaulted debt that a resident could have. But again, our rents on average approach $3,000, in that market a little bit lower, but they're significant. So if it was a dollar limit -- gosh, I thought, Alex, it was a dollar limit, not a month's rent limit, but I'd have to look into that, we'd have to have another conversation. But I think the theme here is the more you regulate things like this, the less capital that will go into the industry, to renovate properties or to create more housing. And it's just a bad idea, and we've got a really good team that's pushing this. And people hear us. When you talked about the administration, I mean, the Biden administration's Build Back Better Act had some terrific stuff about zoning flexibility and encouraging at localities. The Governor of California and the Governor of New York have been pushing supply and more units being built and trying to work with the industry, both on the for sale and rental side. So I think there are people listening to us. It's just we got to keep it up because a lot of the ideas you mentioned are just not constructive. Well, we're excited, as you can tell from the call about our 2023 prospects, the Company's long-term positioning, and we're looking forward to delivering a really good 2023. So, thank you all for your time today and your interest in Equity Residential."

            "name": "Alec Brackenridge",
            "content": "Hey John, yes, it's Alec. It's hard to say that any one is mispriced right now because there's so little transaction activity. The activity that we have seen is typically, say, 1031 buyer who has to place money or maybe a seller who for whatever reason has to move a property. But that's been really hard to -- and few and far between. It's very hard to pick market and say any one of them is more opportunistic than the other. I would say though that looking forward, markets that have a lot of supply coming are -- typically it's coming from merchant builders who are not capitalized to own the property in the long run. And so, I expect to see some opportunities there, new product coming from merchant builders that really want to move it. And other areas of opportunity are -- I'm sure you've read about the private REITs that have the redemption requests that they need to fulfill. Not all of that product is a great fit for us, but some of that might be an opportunity. And then, you have the guys who took on floating rate debt that have caps that are expiring. So, it's been really slow, but I think that there's going to be more opportunity in the next six to nine months and more capitulation probably coming from sellers than buyers given how the financing market has been pretty choppy. Well, the merchant builders really just -- it's just not their game to do that, with rates being high -- I don't know how to put a number on that, to be honest with you. But I think that there will be some trades there. Obviously, some of the private REITs have found alternate sources of capital. So maybe they're able to mitigate that a little bit. And clearly, these caps are probably the highest among the three. And because they're so much higher than they -- I think they're 8 to 10x what they used to cost. So that clearly is an area that's going to be very challenging. Hey Steve, this is Alec. Yes. So, our cost of debt is somewhere around 5%. We would expect a cap rate to be close to that or above that. Longer-term, we'd look at an unleveraged IRR of about 8%. And that's really hard to find in today's market. There are a few opportunities here and there, but largely, sellers are still hanging on to a 4.5% to 4.75%, which is just hard to make the numbers work. And as I said before, I think there might be a little movement on that end. Harder still is the development yield. And if you're thinking that stabilized properties are pricing at around of 5, then development really should be around 6, and it's hard to get to that number with costs continuing to escalate, not as fast as they had been,, whereas they used to be escalating at say, 1% a month, now probably closer to 0.5% a month, but they're still going up and getting from a 5 to 6 is a pretty heavy lift. And most deals prior to the rate hikes were price -- development deals pricing out to about 5% to 5.25%, and that was a nice spread when cap rates were below 4%. Obviously, that's not the case anymore. So getting to a 6% is a heavy lift. And there's just so much that can come out of the price of the land because land is typically, say, 10% to 15% of the entire deal. So it's a heavy lift to get to there. Hey Sam, it's Alec. And yes, we do spend a lot of time looking at supply, and as Michael mentioned earlier, focusing on the proximity of the supply to our properties. And we find that's where we've really gotten the pressure on our ability to grow rents. And it depends where we are. In Manhattan, proximate supply is a lot tighter than, say, in California. So we adjust for that. And what we've seen going from -- and again, this is our property and proximity -- our portfolio and proximity to our properties is in 2022, there was supply that was proximate to us like 110,000 units, and it's going down quite a bit from there. And the average in the past was around -- I'm sorry, 86,000 units are going down quite a bit from there. So we're seeing a lot less immediate supply, and the way we measure it has more to do with that proximity than that market level as a whole. Hi Ami, it's Alec. We've looked at that, and we don't have an impact right now. We can reach those thresholds. It gets challenging, as you know, over time and \u201823 is another benchmark year, and we're working towards that as well. So, so far so good, but it's certainly to get more owners over time."

            "name": "Bob Garechana",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Let me start with bad debt, which should round out our thought process on same-store revenue guidance, followed up with a little commentary on same-store expenses, normalized FFO and the balance sheet. As Michael mentioned, the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance assumes a 90 basis-point reduction in revenue growth due to the impact of bad debt. As we mentioned during last quarter's call, the biggest driver of this drag is the lack of rental relief payments in 2023 relative to 2022. Specifically, we received a little over $32 million in rent relief in 2022 that isn't in the numbers in 2023. And while we ended last year with more residents paying their rent than when we started the year, a trend that we would expect to continue, our forecast doesn't assume this will be significant enough to offset this lack of rental assistance. Unfortunately, recent delays in lifting eviction moratoriums and slow processing within the courts led us to this more cautious forecast that reflects a more modest improvement coming later in the year than we had initially hoped for. We're hopeful that this caution might be unwarranted, in which case we could achieve the top end of our guidance range. But for now, we still expect delinquency to return to pre-pandemic levels, but more likely in 2024 than in 2023. Turning to expenses, I'm proud to report that in 2022, we once again continued to execute on our strategy of using technology and centralization to reduce exposure to labor pressures. Same-store payroll expense growth was negative for the second year in a row, and even when combining payroll with repairs and maintenance, a line item with significant labor exposure and product inflation, growth was below 3% for the second year in a row again. Combine that with low real estate taxes and we were able to deliver industry low expense growth. For 2023, the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance is 4.5%. This forecasted growth rate is about 100 basis points higher than what I just described for 2022 but well below both inflation and our revenue guidance, meaning we expect 2023 to be another year of operating margin expansion for the Company. Of the four major categories of expenses, repairs and maintenance and utilities should grow at a pace slower than 2022, while real estate taxes and payroll should be faster. These latter two categories face challenging comparable periods given 2022's remarkable performance in addition to the following drivers: For real estate taxes, we expect municipalities will recognize the great strong income performance for multifamily in 2022 and as a result take a more aggressive approach to assess values and rates. Total tax growth should be around 4%, up from 1% in 2022 with California continuing to benefit from Prop 13 at the low end of growth and expansion markets like Colorado, Texas and Georgia towards the higher end. These expansion markets are a small part of our same-store portfolio and the expected growth is consistent with what we underwrote on acquisition. For payroll, we expect 2023 growth to be around 3.5%, up from the decline of 2% that I just mentioned in 2022 and still well below typical wage inflation. We believe we can achieve this target through our continued discipline around staffing and optimization of our workflow. Turning to normalized FFO, page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. Our midpoint of $3.75 per share includes a $0.01 of forecasted casualty losses from the California rainstorms that we mentioned in the release, and results in over 6% year-over-year NFFO growth, a very solid year for the Company. Finally, some comments on our planned financing activity for 2023 and the balance sheet. We mentioned in the past that we have an $800 million secured debt pool coming due, most of which needs to be refinanced in the secured market later this year. The current rate on the pool is 4.21% and the maturity is in November. The pool is very financeable, given it is roughly 50% levered and covers debt service nearly 2 times. We have favorably hedged more than half the treasury risk on the financing and would expect to be able to refinance later in the year at a 5% rate or better, which is also incorporated in our guidance. After that, the Company has no maturities to speak of until June of 2025. We have low floating rate exposure, the lowest leverage in our history, significant debt capacity and ample liquidity supported by our recently recast revolver that will support our future capital allocation activities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. So Nick, just from a financial standpoint, like Michael mentioned, concessions are kind of flat, so no contribution to revenue growth or decline to revenue growth, \u201822 to \u201823. Hey John, it's Bob. No, your math is actually pretty accurate. So page 13 kind of gives you a perspective. We were 1% net. When you add back the $32 million that is -- and the math that you probably did to the bad debt, that does work out to, I would have said, 2.25% as a percentage of revenue. And then when you move forward based on the drag on same store, we get to like around 1.90, a little bit closer to 1.85 as a percentage of revenue on that. So you guys have got it triangulated correctly. Yes. So, normal would have been around 50 basis points, would have been kind of typical. And we still do think that that is given the quality of our resident base, et cetera, that that is the likely long-term outcome. And as I mentioned in my remarks, just to be fair, too, it is very difficult to forecast kind of the projection of how fast this improvement that we have seen even outside of rental relief will come. We're hopeful that it's faster than what we put in the numbers, and that could get us there quicker and closer to that 50 basis points faster than what are in the numbers, but you're correct as to as to -- it is not only a minor miracle, but it is great when math works. So your math works perfectly in that specific numbers. No, it's structural. It's a structural kind of tax protection component. It's a piece of debt that actually was financed related to the Archstone acquisition. So, there are certain partners that were in the old Archstone structure that had tax protection. So, we have obligations to maintain some secured debt, a portion of that in secured, and that's why. As you think about the -- so it has nothing to do with kind of anything about that structural piece. When you do look at kind of the secured debt markets relative to the unsecured, the unsecured has come in a little bit. So, it's slightly more favorable than the secured, but they're all pricing in that, call it, high-4s range, especially for really low levered product in the secured like we had -- like we have in this pool. So it's not a market decision choice. It's more of a structural choice."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\nMarty McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Third Quarter 2022 Results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release and accompanying management presentation are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. As you could see from our press release, Equity Residential had an outstanding quarter. Our revenue results in the quarter were driven by steady occupancy, continuing strong renewal rate growth and decelerating but still above trend, new lease rate growth. We couple that with a continuation of modest expense growth leading the same-store NOI growth for the quarter of an exceptional 16.2%. With continuing positive financial leverage, this led to a 19.5% increase in quarter-over-quarter normalized funds from operations. We are proud to have improved margins and created substantial cash flow growth in the turbulent time in the economy. I congratulate my colleagues across Equity Residential for their hard work, taking care of our residents and their fellow employees and producing these impressive financial results. We know at this late point in the year, the focus naturally turns to 2023. As usual, we are not giving guidance at this time, but in the management presentation we posted last night, we tried to frame the material factors that will drive next year's revenue results.  In a moment, Michael will take you through those factors in some detail. We remind you that the success we've had in 2022 will create a challenging comparable period. So we continue to expect a moderation in 2023 annual same-store revenue growth even if as we expect 2023 as a strong above-trend year. Looking at it from the top of the house, we like our Affluent Renter customer and what we expect will be their financial and employment resiliency going into uncertain times. Our target resident is high earning and employed in knowledge industries, with more durable incomes and employment prospects. The college graduate cohort, which we believe makes up the vast majority of our residents has an unemployment rate of 1.8% and compared to the 3.5% overall unemployment rate. Even if layoffs materialize, we believe that the tighter than average labor market for these knowledge workers will allow them to find replacement jobs quickly. Finally, although high inflation has impacted everyone's real incomes, our Affluent Renter is relatively more insulated due to their higher incomes and lower rent-to-income ratios. The average income for the residents who signed new leases with us in the past 12 months is $174,000 or 12% higher than the group who signed with us in the 12 months ending September 2021. These new residents are paying us slightly less than 20% of their income in rent, which is generally consistent with prior rent to income levels. On the apartment supply side, we see national apartment deliveries reaching a cycle high point in 2023. However, in the coastal markets where most of our properties are still located, we see supply as being lower and being delivered further away from our properties than in the past and thus likely less impactful. The Sunbelt markets, including the Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing, will see higher relative supply numbers than our coastal established markets and likely more impact, especially if that's coupled with the job slowdown. For us, this may turn into a nice opportunity to acquire assets in these expansion markets, not necessarily at fire sale prices, but at better values than prevailed in the first half of 2022 when we felt the market was overheated and chose to stay on the sidelines. We continue to see our strategy of having more balanced portfolio between our established and expansion markets as appropriate as we follow our Affluent Renter to these new markets and mitigate regulatory and resiliency risks, from overconcentration in any market or in any state. In addition, other housing alternatives remain expensive and in low supply. Though they have been declining of late, current single-family home prices continue to be at record levels, while rising mortgage rates have further stressed affordability, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Single-family housing starts are declining, existing homeowners are more reluctant to sell due to low locked in mortgage rates along with minimal and expensive for sale replacement options and competition for homes from investors remain strong. Going against these positive factors for our business is a significant impact of inflation on the economy, where job growth goes in response to the Federal Reserve's actions as well as volatility in the capital markets, the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine and a myriad of other uncertainties. We are currently in an excellent spot but acknowledge that the risks and uncertainties are more elevated than usual. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everybody for joining to us today. I'm going to give some brief comments regarding current market conditions, and then we can turn it over to the operator for question and answers. We just completed one of the best leasing seasons in our history. Strong demand across our markets produced high occupancy as well as continued pricing power. As we think about the trajectory of our pricing for the full year, we clearly benefited from a supercharged spring leasing season with more robust pricing power that started earlier in the spring in many markets than we have traditionally seen. This strength led us to adjust our same-store revenues upward in July and to set our current expectations slightly above the midpoint or at 10.6% for the full year 2022 which is the best same-store revenue growth in our history. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that position this portfolio well for 2023. This includes updates on the percentage of our residents renewing with us, which remains very healthy and is now consistent with historical levels after some moderation in the summer, which was expected as we were moving residents to current market rents. This performance supports occupancy, which continues to be solid at 96.2% even as we enter the slower part of the leasing season. As you can see on Page 4 of the accompanying management presentation and as we disclosed in our August 31 press release, our rents peaked in the first week of August and began to moderate, which is typical for this time of the year. Seattle and San Francisco are the two markets that stand out with more recent moderation than anticipated. Concessions are being used more than declines in rental rate in these markets to drive traffic. All other markets are basically in line with normal rent seasonality. And overall, we continue to have good demand for our units in all of our markets with strong foot traffic, which is generally in line with our historical averages for this time of year. While we see the same headlines as everyone else on tech hiring freezes and some layoffs, our revenue performance is holding up although we readily admit that we are a lagging indicator. Right now, New York and Southern California continue to lead in both same-store revenue growth performance and our overall current pricing fundamentals. Seattle and San Francisco, while producing strong annual same-store revenue growth are the markets that have struggled through the most of the year to gain meaningful momentum. Longer term, these 2 markets present growth opportunities as they continue to be under housed and have the potential to show improvement very quickly with the infusion of more certainty of jobs. As Mark mentioned, we are not providing 2023 guidance this quarter, but we understand that 2023 is top of mind. As a result, we provided a framework of helpful building blocks for same-store revenue and expense growth which you can find on Pages 5 through 8 of the management presentation. We would expect 2023 to produce quite good above historical average revenue growth based on activity already built into the rent roll from excellent rent growth that occurred in 2022. We call this our Forecasted Embedded Growth, which reflects the contribution to next year's revenue growth assuming no changes to the rent roll occur. We expect this to be about 4.5% by year-end. For historical context, in a normal year, our forecasted embedded growth would be just above 1%. You can see this on Page 6 of the presentation. In addition to this favorable embedded growth, we are positively positioned for leasing activity in 2023 moving forward. Our Loss to Lease which refers to the revenue improvement we can expect from moving leases in place today to current market levels is significantly larger than historical years as evident on Page 7. Our current Loss to Lease of approximately 5% will seasonally moderate through year-end, but certainly positions us for growth when leases mature and we capture this loss in '23. For historical context, our Loss to Lease would be about 50 basis points at the end of a typical non-recessionary year. With that set up in mind, let's not forget about actual market rent growth during 2023 and its contribution to same-store revenue growth. Current visibility here is most opaque. While our business has strong long-term fundamentals, the uncertainty around future economic conditions that Mark just mentioned is high. This 2023 intraperiod growth should remain healthy as favorable demographics, continued low employment rates in our target demographic, strong income growth and less direct supply pressure in many of our markets point to the potential to see a strong spring lease season. That being said, 2023 is unlikely to be as robust as the unprecedented rent growth numbers of 2022. On the occupancy side, general demand trends, including improving retention, supports strong occupancy above 96% for the balance of 2022 and should carry through into 2023, unless there is a substantial loss of jobs in our target renter demographic. Outside of occupancy and the core revenue drivers that I just discussed, bad debt net will likely continue to play a role in revenue growth as we expect the trend of reduced levels of resident delinquency to continue into 2023. The lack of governmental rental assistance in '23 compared to the $31 million we will receive in 2022 will require continued improvement in resident behavior -- payment behaviors in order to return us closer to historical norms and contribute positively to revenue growth. An improved regulatory environment, coupled with the high quality of our Affluent Renter should lead us in this direction, but 2023 may be a bit of a transition year to get all the way there. Switching to same-store expense growth. As you can see in the press release, 2022 benefited from limited growth in property tax expense and great controls of our payable expenses and as a result, we expect to produce same-store expense growth of 3.3% for the full year 2022. As we described in the management presentation, if the inflationary environment continues as it is today, we would expect expense growth in '23 to be elevated from these industry-leading levels in 2022. While we expect that less controllable areas like real estate tax may come under more pressure, we remain focused on initiatives that can assist in moderating growth in areas that are more controllable like payroll and repairs & maintenance. We have had great success in creating efficiencies in our sales and office functions with over half of our portfolio running with shared resources, and we expect that to continue to benefit us in 2023 as we centralize on-site activities such as application processing and our move-out and collection process. On the service side of the business, we continue to leverage our mobile platform to create more opportunities to part our resources across multiple properties. We also will strategically leverage third parties for outsourcing turns and assisting with afterhours work to reduce overtime pressure in the portfolio. Overall, we are well positioned to continue the trend of expanding our fully loaded net operating margin, which currently sits around 69% into 2023. I want to give a quick shout out to our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to the residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: I appreciate all the building blocks on 2023. If we're looking at kind of same-store revenue growth. Obviously, the market rent will be a big determinant of it. But there's obviously these other building blocks in place already. As you think about the interplay between the ability to push renewals versus that Loss to Lease going in, how sticky can renewals be? And how are you thinking about pricing those on a forward 30 or 60 days, just given the more macroeconomic uncertainty?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Nick, this is Michael. So I think when you're looking at the renewal performance, again, our quotes for the balance of the year have already been issued. So we have all of those quotes out there. And right now, we're seeing improving retention. We're negotiating a little bit more, but that's clearly typical for the fourth quarter and have a pretty strong degree of confidence that we're going to continue to achieve about 8% to 9% in growth from the renewals. So we remain very optimistic about the renewal performance and clearly are seeing the trends of improving stickiness but that is a common trend to see in the fourth quarter that, that retention continues to grow.\nNick Joseph: I guess the question was more on '23, right? So as the Loss to Lease trends down towards the end of this year, just with market rent growth as you start to set rents in '23, if the Loss to Lease is smaller at that point, how comfortable are you going out earlier in the year with renewals just given normal seasonality on the market rent side?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I mean I think you're going to look at what your expectations are. We'll watch what happens to us for the balance of the year and how we start January off is going to be the indicator as to how aggressive we are in March and April. But we clearly are going to layer in intraperiod growth into these quotes into the first and second quarter of next year. And then we have a great centralized negotiation team in place that we can always pivot if we need to. But right now, we're not seeing anything that tells us not to expect kind of growth in that renewal performance after we kind of start the year off.\nNick Joseph: That's helpful. And then just on the pricing sensitivity, you talked about San Francisco and Seattle. I think -- you've talked about the West Coast maybe being a driver for 2023. Does the sensitivity that you're seeing today change that overall view at all?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I mean, I think, look, if you backed us up a few months ago, where our expectations were for 2023, and I think I alluded to it in the comments, I mean, we've got 2 markets right now that are exhibiting a little more price sensitivity than what you thought. That we would be sitting at in October. And most of that sensitivity, it's not necessarily that the rates are coming down. It's the fact that the concessions came kind of a little bit sooner in the year than what we would have thought, right? So you're seeing markets even for us in like San Francisco, where we're running 50% of our applications are now receiving about a month. In Seattle, you're at like 1/3 of the applications at about 3 weeks, that's just a little bit more pronounced than what we would have thought. So I think as we think about 2023 for those markets, I said in the prepared remarks, I still believe there's a lot of potential for those markets to deliver strong growth, we just need a little bit of clarity on that job front, a little less ambiguity. You got good momentum with the quality of life coming back in both of those areas. So I still feel like we got the potential. But sitting here today versus our view a few months ago, the markets feel a little more price sensitive than what we would have thought.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Mike, I just wanted to follow up a little follow up a little bit on the Seattle and San Francisco comment. Are those very specific to kind of downtown Seattle and Downtown San Francisco? Are you seeing any of that weakness spreads to kind of the east side of Seattle or down into the Peninsula?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So we definitely felt a little bit in Redmond, a little bit more softening. A little bit of the concessions are in that marketplace. And I think in San Francisco, what you saw is the South Bay really kind of benefited through the year even though it was delivering all of that supply and right now, my guess is what we're feeling is a little bit of pressure from that hangover supply in the South Bay. So it's not completely isolated to like the downtown or the CBD areas, but it is still mostly concentrated there.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then, I don't know, maybe for Mark or for Bob. Just as you guys think about deploying new capital into new developments, how has your return hurdle changed, just given the change in cost of capital, given the change in the economy and the outlook, how much more conservative are you being on underwriting? And how high have your hurdle rates gone for new developments?\nMark Parrell : Yes. Steve, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. It certainly has gone up. The 2 deals you saw us start this quarter were really things that were in play much earlier, and we were kind of obligated on. It's just the start that occurred. So we have let go of some deals we were pursuing. We have talked a lot with the development team about the higher hurdle. I'm not sure I have a precise number for you, but it was probably a number we were looking more like a 5% return on in-place rents. And now we're looking for something, Steve, probably a lot closer to a 6% return on in-place rents, but you've got deals where there might be a story that's particularly compelling. You like your basis play or some other factor that makes it particularly interesting. I'll also say the big competitor to development with us is acquisitions. I mean our sense is that pretty soon, pretty soon might be a few more months though, the acquisition market will be more available to us, again, not at free prices, not at fire sale prices. But boy, if we can buy existing streams of income without having all that development risk, we'll lean in on that. So my sense is that acquisitions of existing assets will be more available to us at more favorable prices than a correction in the development market. So to answer your question, I think the hurdle is higher for us to start new development both because of cost of capital and because of the ability to deploy that capital instead in acquisitions.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: I just maybe following up on that capital markets kind of outlook. Mark, I mean how are you thinking about how cap rates maybe have changed for apartment assets given that when we look today, I mean even to get GSE debt for multifamily, the radar on that, all-in is going to be somewhere close to 6%. We're hearing negative leverage is more of a problem for people underwriting assets. I mean what is your view on how that may affect cap rates?\nMark Parrell : Yes. And I'm going to take -- thanks for the question, Nick. I'm going to take cap rates and sort of make it in the values in general. I mean the system definitely got a shock. We talked about that on the last call. There's a pretty big bid-ask spread out there. Sellers are saying to themselves, 6, 9 months ago, I could have gotten a much higher price. I'm still getting good cash flow growth, as Michael Manelis just described. Maybe I'll sit on my hands for a while. And buyers are sitting there going, Wow, all risk assets have repriced, apartments should reprice too. So our sense is that this lack of activity, I mean, transaction volume is just really low now. It's really hard to peg value. But our sense is that cap rates have moved from maybe a 3.5% to something like a 5% cap rate for well-located stuff. And to your point, that still requires negative leverage, negative cash flow for a bit. So that is, I think, a problem. And that's why you don't see a lot transacting. On the flip side, people like the apartment business. I mean there is a real dearth of these sorts of inflation, protective investments in apartments, we've done a lot of research on this, have typically performed pretty well in inflationary climates. There's also, by our count, $375 billion or so of dry powder available in real estate private equity funds looking for a home and apartments are a favorite place to invest in. So we think there's a lot of supportive stuff but right now, there's just not a lot of transaction activity. And our sense is that, again, values are down probably 10% plus. And some of that reason, they're not down more is because of this offset from increasing cash flow.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Great. Just another question on the balance sheet. You guys did, I guess, pay down some of 2023 maturities with the sales this quarter. Is it right that -- I mean just from reading this, you have something like $500 million of kind of unhedged exposure to -- on a maturity next year based on the swaps you have in place?\nBob Garechana: Yes, slightly less than that. We have about $825 million of debt that is maturing next year that needs to be refinanced. $800 million of it needs to be refinanced as secured, of which we've got $350 million of at this point, very attractively priced swaps against it managing those -- the treasury risk.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: Mark, I'd like to go back to that acquisition point. So you guys talked about that there can be potential opportunity and therefore, the grid might look better in terms of acquisitions versus development. What sort of opportunities do you think can come from this environment? Like is there a way to contextualize it? We understand it cannot be as good as 2021 likely, but can it look something like 2020 or maybe even 2019 from a volume standpoint? And then how would you think about funding it, given we are still in that negative leverage territory and you said that prices might come down, but not at fire sale levels?\nMark Parrell : Chandni, it's Mark. Thanks for that great question. You really hit on it because you really need to split this into 2 pieces. What do you feel about the asset price, and we'll talk about that in a second. And where are you getting the money from. And so talking about asset price we already like where it's headed, where these assets are being talked about, again, not a lot of transactions, but a lot of these sales that are being discussed are -- don't have that big premium to replacement cost.  At the end of '21, the beginning of this year, we saw transactions where acquisitions were being done at 25%, 30% premiums to replacement cost. You saw us stand down. We just don't see a history of making a lot of money when you pay those kind of premiums. So we see the price change as having evaporated a good amount of that, and we see deals being talked about, at least for sale much closer to replacement costs. So we like that. So when we think about asset pricing, replacement cost figures in, the cap rate certainly figures in the price per pound. All those things matter to us. But where we get the money? Because we're going to continue to trade out of some of these existing markets, D.C., the State of California, New York, so where do those assets trade on a relative basis compared to these expansion markets. And if they trade in a way that makes sense to us, i.e., in a nondilutive way, that will be more interesting to us. In terms of deploying new capital, which would have to be raised with debt, right now, we think our unsecured debt rate is probably 5.75, something like that. That's a pretty mighty interest rate to overcome and cap rates being around 5 aren't going to push that. And again, looking at where the stock is trading, that doesn't make a lot of sense. So for us to be net acquirers is going to require, I think, some shift in our capital costs. For us to be swappers of assets like we've been, traders is going to require that trade to make sense and then for asset values to make sense. And they are starting to, on a replacement cost basis. But I think your guidepost 2018, 2019 is a pretty good guidepost because I think what happened in the pandemic with ultra-low rates, that was the distortion, but I also don't think very high rates is a permanent future either.\nChandni Luthra: That's very helpful color. And switching gears to the expense side of the equation just a little bit. What are the markets in your portfolio where you think real estate taxes could pose a bigger problem? And then on payroll, is there any more low-hanging fruit as you think about streamlining that line item further, just given where compares are going into next year?\nBob Garechana: Chandni, it's Bob. I'll start with the payroll tax side. I think the most prevalent or probably the area that you see the most pressure already is really in some of our expansion markets, particularly Texas, where you're seeing an aggressive amount of kind of reassessment activity and kind of push. So I think that's going to be an area in the expansion markets where we don't have a ton of exposure at the moment, but where you will see more real estate tax pressure. The state of Washington is also one that is an area because it's been so negative, right? So real estate tax growth has actually been negative. So you have a really challenging comp. And the final area, I think, where you're going to see it is just we do have some 421-a step-ups in New York State, which will contribute to growth as we go into 2023. So a little bit of a mixed bag, but those are the 3 areas I'd call out specifically. And I'll pass it over to Michael, who will mention some of the initiatives on the payroll side.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So I think on the payroll front, I don't think I'd characterize any of this as like low-hanging fruit left. I think this is really just the strategic execution of these initiatives. And if I sit here today, I would tell you, we're probably about 2/3 of the way from many of these centralized initiatives, and that usually yields kind of that efficiency in the on-site payroll team as we start sharing and leveraging resources across assets. So I'm pretty optimistic that as we work our way through 2023, there's probably 1/3 of the work left to be done with centralization and it's going to continue to yield kind of the benefits that will help mitigate some of the pressures that we're feeling.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste : So a couple questions here. I guess the first is a follow-up to an earlier question on sort of capital allocation. I'm curious what is the best use of your capital today? You did take $500 million of disposition proceeds to prepay some of the bond maturity. So perhaps some color on, as you think about uses for capital today, thoughts on further debt reduction, stock buyback. And then maybe also, what is the plan for the remaining $900 million of the unsecured bond maturities for next spring?\nMark Parrell : All right. You had like a 4-part question, Haendel. And thank you. So I'm going to take parts of it all the way up to stock buybacks, and I'll ask Bob to speak to the refinancing plan for next year. So when you talk about immediate capital allocation, our hope is that we can accelerate our renovations a little more. We've got a lot of great, super well-located properties where we touch ups in the kitchen and bath and stuff, especially if rent growth is going to moderate for a bit, our experience has been that, that's a good time to do these renovations, then when things start to accelerate again, you've got some better product to sell. We're hopeful that, that also means that some of these labor pressures that we've alluded to and others have to, start to abate next year. You've got less action in single family.  Maybe there's an opportunity because we're really having trouble getting contractors and sometimes getting things like appliances for renovation. So renovation is a good use of capital. You should expect us to try and accelerate that. Again, these are all near-term things. Innovation expenditures, so this relates both to our terrific presentation inside the company this week about all we want to do relating to sustainability and whether it's solar panels and EV charging and all that. A lot of that stuff is pretty capital-intensive. A good part of it has some returns, which is great. Some doesn't. But I think we're going to -- you're going to see us lean in there, both as part of our thought process on ESG in general and because of the return and the demands of our residents. And finally, just the innovation part. We've kicked off a big data analytics push inside the company. That is expensive, both in terms of talent and outside help. In the long run, we think it will help us drive revenue, manage expenses better, run the business better in general. But those are all areas where we're spending money. On the share buyback, and you and I have had this conversation publicly and privately in the past, it's really hard, though, in this case to even think about it in a market where things are this uncertain. We just talked about how hard it is to peg underlying asset values. So to really understand the relationship of your stock to underlying asset values and sort of do that arbitrage you are referring to, is a very challenging thing right now. Doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t think the stock has room to go up, certainly. But just at the moment, taking more risk, which would mean either issuing debt or selling assets into an uncertain asset sale environment. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. So I wouldn't say share buybacks are top of mind at the moment.\nBob Garechana: And then following up, big picture on the balance sheet, we feel very good about where the balance sheet is. We expect to actually end the balance sheet at record low net debt to EBITDA. By the end of the year, we'll probably be in the mid-4s. We're already at 5 as it is. So the balance sheet is in great shape, is very long duration, has limited kind of interest rate exposure, and we have almost no floating rate. So we feel really well positioned. As we think about moving into 2023, the component of debt or the piece of debt that is due or the majority of it is actually a piece of secured debt that is $800 million that was done originally in context with the Archstone transaction and has some structural requirements that will require us to refinance it. So what we're anticipating is that we'll refinance it in the secured market and then we put on some hedges, some attractively priced hedges to manage the interest rate risk. And thereafter, in '24, we have no maturities at all, so which is an anomaly, right? So when you look at the $800 million or so we need to do over the next 2 years, it's very manageable.\nHaendel St. Juste : On the cost of the new potentials -- debt, the arrangement that you just mentioned, where are you pegging that cost broadly for -- for new debt?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So this would be secured pricing, which is actually inside of unsecured right now. So if you looked at the GSEs for -- and relatively low leverage because this is a very well-supported kind of pool, you're probably without regard to the hedges we have in place, you're probably in the 5.5 range, so about 25 basis points below what Mark had mentioned on the unsecured side. When you factor into the swaps that we already have in place that hedge a portion of it at kind of treasury rates that are effective around a 3, we should be able to execute closer to 5 or maybe even sub-5 depending on what happens. This loan matures very late in 2023. So we have a long runway before we actually need to refinance.\nMark Parrell : And really just to give you some more color hand out, the existing rate isn't just the listed rate there. There are hedges that went with that portfolio. So the actual rate running through the P&L is.\nBob Garechana: 4.25%.\nMark Parrell : 4.25%. So when you think about your modeling exercise, as Bob said, for really what will amount to the last month or 2 of 2023 and then going forward, it's really the difference between 4.25% and wherever Bob ends up financing this. And we've got the luxury of another year to see if we can pick a spot to do that in.\nHaendel St. Juste : That's really helpful. Mark, one more follow-up, and I promise this looks a lot shorter, only -- maybe 2 parts. But cap rates you mentioned moving from about 3.5% to around 5% for well-located assets. I'm curious if you're seeing any distinction between Coastal and Sunbelt? And if so, how that might play into your plans of rotating more of your NOI into Sunbelt markets maybe a bit sooner or any thoughts on that?\nMark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, Haendel. I don't have any thoughts on that just because the transaction pool is so light. There's so little going on in any market, just sharing anecdotally, a large national broker told us that a large southeastern apartment market, they didn't have a single listing at this time. So then that's unprecedented. So I just got to tell you, the markets are just not very liquid. And so for me to be able to peg Coastal or Sunbelt, I wish I could peg anything right now. I think right now, it's just a little bit of everyone feeling each other out. What's the Fed going to do? How is that going to feel? Do operating results hold up? All of those things, and all, I think, are a little bit in flux. But as I said in my prior remarks, we're really interested in the relationship between those 2. And if we can continue to nondilutively trade, we will.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: So back to that kind of Sunbelt question. People think of EQR as an urban platform at this point. Understanding you're diversifying and looking into the Sunbelt in your expansion markets, but the big fear there is supply, and that now is becoming a reality, and that doesn't just suddenly start and then stop. It becomes a thing to deal with for some period of time. So is there a scenario despite what you just said that this trade idea into expansion markets where opportunities present themselves because of some of those supply pressures does not materialize and you start to look at these expansion markets and say, yes, maybe this isn't exactly where we want to go because do we really want to get in bed with an extended period of supply growth, which is, again, the big fear of getting into those markets if there are any?\nMark Parrell : Yes. Great question, Rich. It's Mark. So it would require us to think about another risk differently, too, and that's political risk because one of the things that our coastal markets have, I think, more of though maybe not quite as much of as we may have thought, is risk of rent control, risk of activity by politicians that's job destroying and growth destroying. So from our perspective, we'd have to be balancing that differently as well. There is no risk-free apartment market. So if you're in Texas market, you probably have less political risk, but you may have more resiliency risk and you certainly have a lot more supply risk than a lot of our markets. But our experience with supply in the locations we're trying to buy in and build in like Frisco, Texas is, you'll have a year or 2 of that, and then demand will need debt supply. So again, if you're telling me that prices get out of whack, that somehow the Sunbelt trades tight even with all that supply, that's probably not stuff we're going to be acquiring or building much of. But if the pricing relationship makes sense, then we're trying to manage this political risk versus the supply risk and I think balancing that out makes sense to us. So that's kind of where we end up on that.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And then second question for me, one parter, by the way. The embedded growth math, you define it as last month annualized and you get to 4.5% for 2023. But is there another mathematical equation where you think further back into 2022? A lease that was signed in July at 20% higher rent would compare favorably in January. And so my question is, is the 4.5% one number, but is there another \"embedded\" growth calculation that might be substantially higher than that giving voice to leases that were signed late second quarter, third quarter and so on?\nMark Parrell : Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start, and I think Bob and Michael may end up correcting me. But I think that's the embedded growth in loss. You're talking about more of a Loss to Lease a little bit in there, and we split those 2 up. So if you think about it, embedded is the rearview mirror. Those are already contracts that have been written leases that exist. And in your example, that Loss to Lease is us writing up to market. So if January rents are say, relatively low. And then as we would expect, seasonally, they're higher in June and the lease you just referred to in June is written higher. That additional increment we were referring to is that Loss to Lease and has the intraperiod growth. So we're talking about the same thing. We just kind of compartmentalized it a little differently because it was a little easier to think about in 3 pieces.\nRich Anderson: Okay. That's fair. So maybe my definition of embedded is Loss to Lease plus your definition of embedded, maybe that's the way to think of it.\nMark Parrell : You had a one-part question and we split it into 3 parts, right? But we are just -- we're just chopping it up a little different because it seems to us, those are different variables and easier to explain, but I think you're on it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robyn Luu with Green Street.\nRobyn Luu: So I wanted to ask across the portfolio. As eviction processes begin to normalize in some of your markets, are you seeing an erosion in pricing power as market level vacancies tick up?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So Robin, this is Michael. Maybe let me just give you a little context overall around the eviction moratorium and kind of what we're seeing today relative to that activity. So for the most part, the moratoriums have generally expired. We still have a couple of these local areas in California where there's various proof of hardships and restrictions. And all of -- most of these exceptions are set to expire in the beginning of early 2023. I'm going to tell you right now that the teams today are all over this process of continuing to work with these residents who've experienced hardship. And once we've exhausted all those options, we're ensuring that we have everything filed properly. We are still in the very early stages of this eviction court process. And we are starting to see some traction where the courts are actually moving through and following through kind of with lockouts. Overall, this level of eviction activity in the portfolio is just -- it's not that material, and we typically average less than like 1% of our move-outs from -- for this reason. So I would tell you, even if everything was accelerated through the court system today, the volume would be more than manageable and would actually be a huge positive to us given the strength in the demand and the confidence we have in being able to fill those units with paying residents. Short term, I think going specific to your question, sure. We're going to feel a little bit of this occupancy pressure or loss of occupancy pockets of Southern California. But again, the demand is so strong that we're going to quickly recover from that. And I don't really see it playing into kind of the pricing. And I think our view right now is that the expectation you're just going to see us gradually fall back into this pre-pandemic level of eviction activity as we work our way through 2023.\nBob Garechana: And Robyn, it's Bob. Just to add real quick. If you think about those residents that are residing and not paying, they're fully reserved from a financial standpoint. So that occupancy -- that physical occupancy coming back into the market and us kind of capturing it like Michael just mentioned, is a dollar for dollar, 100% upside to financial results because whether it's $0.50 less a month or before, it's a full rental payment more than what's going through the financial statement. So it's a big net benefit.\nRobyn Luu: Got it. That makes sense. So I wanted to touch on San Francisco and Seattle a little bit more. So can you give a sense of the retention and foot traffic trends that you're seeing in both of those markets? And how those have really compared to like the 2019 levels?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So this is Michael again, Robyn. So the Seattle market today is renewing a little bit less than what we would say our historical averages would be. San Francisco is -- again, it's more in line, but it's also a little bit lighter from a foot traffic and a application volume standpoint, both markets demonstrate demand. And I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s just at a little bit lower, more price-sensitive level than what we would have expected. But when we're looking at this volume and comparing it to like '19 week after week, we are seeing the foot traffic. We are seeing the conversions to applications. It's just at a little bit less of a price point. And our hope right now as we get through this fourth quarter and turn the corner into the year, we will see this retention start to improve and take a little bit of the pressure off of the front door, and we are seeing slight trends of that right now, but we need a little bit more momentum and time to kind of clarify on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein : I just wanted to touch on supply. What are you seeing for 2023? And for Seattle and San Francisco, how much of the supply dynamic was playing into that price sensitivity that you guys were referring to?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So this is Michael. Let me start with Seattle and San Francisco. So I think clearly in Downtown Seattle, we're feeling some of the pressure from the new supply in that market. And San Francisco, like I said, I think earlier in one of the responses to a question, maybe a little bit in South Bay that they had a lot of supply. These markets are set to deliver less supply next year, so taking a little bit of the pressure off. And maybe with that, I'll just transition to kind of an overarching view of supply for '23, which is for us, we're very focused on this concentration, the proximity of the new supply and from an operations standpoint, when are the first units going to actually start hitting the market to be leasing. And when we look forward, these expected starts in '23 relative to the proximity within like 1 or 2 miles of our locations is lower than previous years, which is a really good indicator that we should continue to feel less pressure from the new supply being right on top of us. Specific to '23 deliveries, I would say that the overall direct pressure will be less. But clearly, like the D.C. market stands out as needing to see marked improvement in absorption because it has like another 15,000 units coming online with slightly more of an impact from a competitive standpoint to our portfolio. And then outside of D.C., look, we're going to have some pockets in L.A. like Wilshire, Koreatown, Hollywood, where we expect to have some pressure next year. And in addition to that, I think the Downtown submarket in Denver, we're going to face some direct kind of head to head. And besides those buckets, every year, we have these small isolated pockets of supply but as we look into '23, we just see that we're going to have fewer of those concentrated pockets, and we're just not going to have as much kind of direct pressure on us. And I think when we stand back and look at this, this portfolio with these amazing locations are clearly in places where affluent renters want to live and still have these good demand drivers and that definitely insulates us from some of this direct pressure from the supply.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim : I wanted to ask about your forecasted earning of 4.5%. Based on leases you signed this year, I would have thought it would have been maybe 50 to 100 basis points higher than that. So I was wondering if you could talk about the factors that drove this, whether it's purely 4Q rents declining? Or if there are other factors like occupancy and bad debt that are in this number? And is there a chance that the earnings could come in higher than your current estimate?\nBob Garechana: John, it's Bob. So just level setting real quick on earn-in/embedded growth, which we do think of them as pretty interchangeable. They don't have any regard to bad -- like this has no regard to bad debt, no regard to vacancy loss, now any of that. My guess is, and I'm not -- and maybe you can help me a little bit on how you're getting to your number is that you're maybe taking -- taking blended rates and kind of averaging blended rates over the year and coming up with that number is my guess on how you're coming with your 50 basis points higher than what our embedded number is. Is that how you're approaching it?\nJohn Kim : Yes, pretty much. Adjusting for timing of lease time, but --\nBob Garechana: Yes. And I guess what I would tell you is that the difference is really waiting. So the way that we're calculating it really has actual waiting day by day as to when leases are in place. So took my blended lease rates over the year and just kind of extrapolated and did a mid-quarter convention, et cetera, I'd probably come up with a number that's around a 5%. But if you actually do the pinpoint map, which we provided you, that's the 4.5%. That number shouldn't move almost at all. It's our forecasted number for the end of the year. So that number really shouldn't move much at all as we go into -- as we finish out the year based on our guidance. Does that help?\nJohn Kim : Yes, it does. And Bob, while I have you, the Loss to Lease, I know it's come down from 12.5% to a little bit over 5% and a lot of it was the leases you signed during the quarter to realize the market rents. But can you also talk about how much market rents have declined as part of that Loss to Lease number since your last update?\nBob Garechana: Yes, I'll pass it over to Michael. I think if you look a good visual as I pass it over to him, is that pricing trend page, which is a couple of pages before, maybe Page 5 in the management presentation and you can kind of see that sequential trend, but that will help you directionally. And Michael, you probably have that.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. No, John, I was just going to point you right to that page. And if you look at kind of the month end rent numbers, down below in that chart, you can kind of get yourself a proxy to understand depending on which month you pick up the peak -- lease, it's 4% or 5% off of kind of that August number and just work your way through that. But I'll tell you, when you think about that Loss to Lease and you think about the shifts that have occurred with the deceleration in that number, it's really important to understand like that comparative period. If you're looking back to that summer period and saying, boy, you guys were 11% or 12%, and now you're sitting down closer to 5%, you need to remember that the majority of this decline is this seasonality that you can kind of see evident on Page 4, but also every lease and every renewal that we have done since that point, we are capturing that Loss to Lease that we shared from a while ago. And overall, the Loss to Lease it may be a little bit lighter than where we thought it was going to be a few months ago. But I'll tell you, just -- it is directionally and definitely right in the ballpark of where we modeled this thing for a few months ago. So we're just not seeing it. And I think that Page 4 really kind of highlights as to how you can think about that trend.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ami Probandt with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith : It's Michael Goldsmith. Over the last couple of years, you saw residents requiring more space and decoupling. Have you seen any of that reverse as we've moved past COVID? And then related to that, have move out due to high rent -- doing rent fee too high increased, presumably, people aren't moving out to purchase a new home anymore. So where are they now moving to?\nMichael Manelis: Michael, this is Michael. So on a decoupling or even a recoupling basis, we're just not seeing a material change. I think during this pandemic recovery period we've alluded to on the last call, we saw a slight decline in like the average adults per household. We ran about [1.65] and we were down at like [1.57]. And that was really more prevalent in our one bedroom unit types where we used to have 2 adults and they moved into a 2-bedroom or did something different. So -- we looked at this even for the third quarter of these move-ins, which there's some seasonality of that when do the 3-bedrooms fill up and stuff like that. And we're right on par with where we were in the third quarter of last year. So we haven't really observed any of these material changes. But I'll tell you, we've got great insight into it. We're watching the transfer behaviors. We're watching roommate activity. We're looking at unit type preferences on our website for prospects. And we'll be on it if we see anything shifting, we just haven't seen anything shift yet. And then in terms of kind of the reasons for move out, I mean you alluded to the home buying, you're absolutely correct. That number is materially down. During the third quarter, we're at like 8% of our move-out sited, home buying is the reason for move out. That's compared to like a 12% norm. But we did see a tick up in that rent is too expensive as a reason we're up at like 25%. Part of that was by design. We said this at the end of the second quarter that we were going to be fairly aggressive in July and August kind of pushing these renewals and holding the line and getting people up to market. So we knew we were going to take a little bit of that hit, and we expected that number to go up. As we work our way through the fourth quarter and first quarter, my guess is we're going to continue to kind of see that number moderate down. But I don't anticipate seeing reasons for move-out to buy home, materially change at all. My guess is it's going to stay very low.\nMichael Goldsmith : As a quick follow-up to that. With those that indicated that rent was too high, did you see any variations by region? Presumably certain areas of the country are used to kind of elevated rents and rents moving higher over time, whereas maybe this phenomenon is relatively new. So did you see any difference by market or region?\nMichael Manelis: Not a huge difference. I'll tell you in California where you had 1482 and you had some of the CPI plus 5 caps, maybe a little bit less, we're citing that because they were going out at 9% or 10% increases against the market that was up 19% or 20%. So those folks typically stuck around because they didn't have a lot of options. I look at like overall, I will tell you, when you just look and Mark alluded to this in his prepared remarks, is the health of the new residents moving into this portfolio from an income standpoint, our income -- rent as a percent of income is right in line at 19%, which, to me, kind of points to this fact that these new residents moving in are clearly going to be able to absorb kind of future increases that we push through into the portfolio.\nMichael Goldsmith : Got it. And as a follow-up question, suburban properties have been generally outperforming kind of in following the initial COVID period. But we\u2019re seeing a shift back to urban. Like what does the current demand picture look like for suburban versus urban? And does that kind of -- does it look different in different markets where there's -- where some markets are favoring urban more than suburban and the reverse is true?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So I mean, overall, we're not seeing a significant shift of like urban and suburban. We look at migration patterns, where are people coming to us, where are people leaving and what is the renewal patterns look like? And there's nothing that really pops out. I think clearly, when you look at like a Seattle, San Francisco and some of these urban markets, we continue to see this trend where we are drawing in new residents from a wider area from outside of the states, from outside of the MSAs, which we view as a positive, meaning that these markets are continuing to draw people from all over kind of the country and even the foreign markets. But nothing that's really like a delineation that I can point to between urban and suburban that says they're acting materially different.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler.\nConnor Mitchell : I have 2 questions. First, I do just want to revisit the San Francisco and Seattle price sensitivity once more. And I guess my question is, what do you guys see as being the largest reason for the price sensitivity? I know we talked about the supply pressure compared to other markets. It's also more concentrated in the urban areas. So does this seem that the supply pressure is the primary cause? Or is there push back to return to office is a large reason or perhaps another reason for the sensitivity and the concessions in these markets?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So this is Michael. So I mean clearly, I think you cited a lot of those reasons in San Francisco and Seattle. Early on, there was an ambiguity around return to office. There's still a little bit of a kind of a sense of, okay, what does hybrid work really look and feel like across the tax. Clearly, you've seen the press releases out or the articles being written on all the recent announcements, which just creates a pause in people's minds around jobs and what are these folks doing with layoffs and growth. When I look at it right now, again, I think this is like a material -- immaterial kind of change that we're seeing. It's the markets that didn't really recover as much and I think what you're seeing is a market trying to hold on to rates where they are and use concessions more than let that rate kind of moderate down.\nConnor Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is regarding the Toll Brothers JV. And then in the current environment with the rapid rise in mortgage rates, has it impacted their willingness to do JVs with you guys, it doesn't mean more or less demand for the products and then whether they're more or less eager for a JV?\nMark Parrell : It's Mark. Thanks for that question. We were just with them last week, and they remain very committed to the joint venture as do we. Like us, they realize the market's moved and new deals have to hurdle over a higher number and have to make sense in this new environment. So they're adjusting, but there's no -- we sense no lack of commitment either on the personnel or capital side from Toll and there's none from us as long as the deals make sense. And I think that's the challenge right now. We're just not seeing deals that make sense because they're kind of priced in the old scheme. And as I said earlier in my remarks, the price system has changed and development yields need to be higher.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: I'll keep it quick here with just one. Just looking at kind of the drivers of the same-store revenue growth for 2023. Look, I think the embedded growth, I appreciate the color earlier. I think that's hopefully should be kind of well understood. But wondering though in kind of the occupancy and then the bad debt side, occupancy may look like it was just a very moderate kind of step down in September versus -- October versus September. Wondering kind of what the view is as we kind of get into next year and kind of the view on occupancy? I think you called it healthy physical occupancy, would love to just kind of elaborate on that. And then I guess similarly on bad debt, right, currently 225 basis points versus historical norms of 50. With some of this kind of improved regulatory environment, where could that potentially take bad debt next year? And again, kind of just thinking about potential impact on same-store revenue growth in those building blocks?\nMichael Manelis: Adam, this is Michael. Maybe I'll start and just hit on the occupancy and I'll turn it over to Bob to talk about the bad debt. So for us, when I'm describing healthy occupancy, to me, that's running in a range of 96% to 96.5%. And I think right now, it's too early for us to say. We'll expect in the fourth quarter, occupancy does tail off a little bit. You're seeing it in this portfolio. It's not unusual, what we're seeing. The health when you turn the corner into January and how we're looking and feeling about that intraperiod job growth is really going to be how we kind of put into our model as to what the expectations are. But right now, I will tell you, we still feel very comfortable saying that we expect next year to be in that range of what we would define as a healthy occupancy.\nBob Garechana: Yes. And from a bad debt standpoint, we do think over time that we should see a return back to kind of our normalized levels, which were pre-pandemic, the 50 basis points you highlighted. Just given the nature of our resident base and their rent to income ratios and all the positive things that we've talked about on this call. The challenge from a financial standpoint or a financial statement standpoint or something to keep in mind is that in 2022, we had about $31 million worth of rental assistance and that's not going to repeat itself in 2023, right? So in order for you to break even from a growth perspective on same-store revenue, organic kind of bad debt has to improve by at least $31 million, from there is when you would then see it start be a contributor to growth.  All that being said, we have seen improvement in just the actual payment from our residents every month kind of sequentially since June or so and would expect that trend to continue. But it's a little bit of a race between that trend and this bad debt or this rental assistance that we won't have in 2023. But we're optimistic that we will return over time to normalized levels.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: Just one, I know you're indicating that expenses go up for next year, but can you remind us why you've had greater success than competitors in capping expense growth and whether these competitive advantages are impact on a relative basis for '23?\nBob Garechana: Yes, I'll start and Michael can add in if you like. I think in the areas that are controllable -- are most controllable, our innovation focus has really been on eliminating or reducing the amount of labor cost exposure, which has been something that has been very prevalent in the inflationary environment. So I think that we've done an excellent job of rethinking where we can use technology, where we can mitigate labor exposure, ours or contract labor. It doesn't really matter what labor there is just by being more efficient by using technology, by increasing visibility and a lot of the initiatives we've had have really helped us deliver what has really been record kind of payroll growth and has kept the R&M line on the contract side a little bit more in check, even though there are other pressures there. So that's certainly been a big help and something that we are going to continue to focus on as we go through generation, I'll call it, 3.0 of innovation. The other area that, in all candor has also helped us as real estate taxes, right? We have benefited from in our jurisdictions having lower real estate taxes overall, and that was, I think, very prevalent in 2022. Is not as likely to repeat itself as we go into 2023 because I think as assessors look back, they typically look back at historical performance, and we've had record performance in our markets in 2022. And so that's going to put pressure on the real estate tax side that is a little less controllable. And I guess the final part on real estate tax side is that in California, of course, you do benefit from Prop 13. So you've got kind of 2% baked in there. But in the other jurisdictions, we'll have some pressure.\nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell : Thank you all for your time on the call and your interest in Equity Residential, and we look forward to seeing everyone during the conference season. Thank you. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everybody for joining to us today. I'm going to give some brief comments regarding current market conditions, and then we can turn it over to the operator for question and answers. We just completed one of the best leasing seasons in our history. Strong demand across our markets produced high occupancy as well as continued pricing power. As we think about the trajectory of our pricing for the full year, we clearly benefited from a supercharged spring leasing season with more robust pricing power that started earlier in the spring in many markets than we have traditionally seen. This strength led us to adjust our same-store revenues upward in July and to set our current expectations slightly above the midpoint or at 10.6% for the full year 2022 which is the best same-store revenue growth in our history. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that position this portfolio well for 2023. This includes updates on the percentage of our residents renewing with us, which remains very healthy and is now consistent with historical levels after some moderation in the summer, which was expected as we were moving residents to current market rents. This performance supports occupancy, which continues to be solid at 96.2% even as we enter the slower part of the leasing season. As you can see on Page 4 of the accompanying management presentation and as we disclosed in our August 31 press release, our rents peaked in the first week of August and began to moderate, which is typical for this time of the year. Seattle and San Francisco are the two markets that stand out with more recent moderation than anticipated. Concessions are being used more than declines in rental rate in these markets to drive traffic. All other markets are basically in line with normal rent seasonality. And overall, we continue to have good demand for our units in all of our markets with strong foot traffic, which is generally in line with our historical averages for this time of year. While we see the same headlines as everyone else on tech hiring freezes and some layoffs, our revenue performance is holding up although we readily admit that we are a lagging indicator. Right now, New York and Southern California continue to lead in both same-store revenue growth performance and our overall current pricing fundamentals. Seattle and San Francisco, while producing strong annual same-store revenue growth are the markets that have struggled through the most of the year to gain meaningful momentum. Longer term, these 2 markets present growth opportunities as they continue to be under housed and have the potential to show improvement very quickly with the infusion of more certainty of jobs. As Mark mentioned, we are not providing 2023 guidance this quarter, but we understand that 2023 is top of mind. As a result, we provided a framework of helpful building blocks for same-store revenue and expense growth which you can find on Pages 5 through 8 of the management presentation. We would expect 2023 to produce quite good above historical average revenue growth based on activity already built into the rent roll from excellent rent growth that occurred in 2022. We call this our Forecasted Embedded Growth, which reflects the contribution to next year's revenue growth assuming no changes to the rent roll occur. We expect this to be about 4.5% by year-end. For historical context, in a normal year, our forecasted embedded growth would be just above 1%. You can see this on Page 6 of the presentation. In addition to this favorable embedded growth, we are positively positioned for leasing activity in 2023 moving forward. Our Loss to Lease which refers to the revenue improvement we can expect from moving leases in place today to current market levels is significantly larger than historical years as evident on Page 7. Our current Loss to Lease of approximately 5% will seasonally moderate through year-end, but certainly positions us for growth when leases mature and we capture this loss in '23. For historical context, our Loss to Lease would be about 50 basis points at the end of a typical non-recessionary year. With that set up in mind, let's not forget about actual market rent growth during 2023 and its contribution to same-store revenue growth. Current visibility here is most opaque. While our business has strong long-term fundamentals, the uncertainty around future economic conditions that Mark just mentioned is high. This 2023 intraperiod growth should remain healthy as favorable demographics, continued low employment rates in our target demographic, strong income growth and less direct supply pressure in many of our markets point to the potential to see a strong spring lease season. That being said, 2023 is unlikely to be as robust as the unprecedented rent growth numbers of 2022. On the occupancy side, general demand trends, including improving retention, supports strong occupancy above 96% for the balance of 2022 and should carry through into 2023, unless there is a substantial loss of jobs in our target renter demographic. Outside of occupancy and the core revenue drivers that I just discussed, bad debt net will likely continue to play a role in revenue growth as we expect the trend of reduced levels of resident delinquency to continue into 2023. The lack of governmental rental assistance in '23 compared to the $31 million we will receive in 2022 will require continued improvement in resident behavior -- payment behaviors in order to return us closer to historical norms and contribute positively to revenue growth. An improved regulatory environment, coupled with the high quality of our Affluent Renter should lead us in this direction, but 2023 may be a bit of a transition year to get all the way there. Switching to same-store expense growth. As you can see in the press release, 2022 benefited from limited growth in property tax expense and great controls of our payable expenses and as a result, we expect to produce same-store expense growth of 3.3% for the full year 2022. As we described in the management presentation, if the inflationary environment continues as it is today, we would expect expense growth in '23 to be elevated from these industry-leading levels in 2022. While we expect that less controllable areas like real estate tax may come under more pressure, we remain focused on initiatives that can assist in moderating growth in areas that are more controllable like payroll and repairs & maintenance. We have had great success in creating efficiencies in our sales and office functions with over half of our portfolio running with shared resources, and we expect that to continue to benefit us in 2023 as we centralize on-site activities such as application processing and our move-out and collection process. On the service side of the business, we continue to leverage our mobile platform to create more opportunities to part our resources across multiple properties. We also will strategically leverage third parties for outsourcing turns and assisting with afterhours work to reduce overtime pressure in the portfolio. Overall, we are well positioned to continue the trend of expanding our fully loaded net operating margin, which currently sits around 69% into 2023. I want to give a quick shout out to our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to the residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Yes. Nick, this is Michael. So I think when you're looking at the renewal performance, again, our quotes for the balance of the year have already been issued. So we have all of those quotes out there. And right now, we're seeing improving retention. We're negotiating a little bit more, but that's clearly typical for the fourth quarter and have a pretty strong degree of confidence that we're going to continue to achieve about 8% to 9% in growth from the renewals. So we remain very optimistic about the renewal performance and clearly are seeing the trends of improving stickiness but that is a common trend to see in the fourth quarter that, that retention continues to grow. Yes. I mean I think you're going to look at what your expectations are. We'll watch what happens to us for the balance of the year and how we start January off is going to be the indicator as to how aggressive we are in March and April. But we clearly are going to layer in intraperiod growth into these quotes into the first and second quarter of next year. And then we have a great centralized negotiation team in place that we can always pivot if we need to. But right now, we're not seeing anything that tells us not to expect kind of growth in that renewal performance after we kind of start the year off. Well, I mean, I think, look, if you backed us up a few months ago, where our expectations were for 2023, and I think I alluded to it in the comments, I mean, we've got 2 markets right now that are exhibiting a little more price sensitivity than what you thought. That we would be sitting at in October. And most of that sensitivity, it's not necessarily that the rates are coming down. It's the fact that the concessions came kind of a little bit sooner in the year than what we would have thought, right? So you're seeing markets even for us in like San Francisco, where we're running 50% of our applications are now receiving about a month. In Seattle, you're at like 1/3 of the applications at about 3 weeks, that's just a little bit more pronounced than what we would have thought. So I think as we think about 2023 for those markets, I said in the prepared remarks, I still believe there's a lot of potential for those markets to deliver strong growth, we just need a little bit of clarity on that job front, a little less ambiguity. You got good momentum with the quality of life coming back in both of those areas. So I still feel like we got the potential. But sitting here today versus our view a few months ago, the markets feel a little more price sensitive than what we would have thought. Yes. So we definitely felt a little bit in Redmond, a little bit more softening. A little bit of the concessions are in that marketplace. And I think in San Francisco, what you saw is the South Bay really kind of benefited through the year even though it was delivering all of that supply and right now, my guess is what we're feeling is a little bit of pressure from that hangover supply in the South Bay. So it's not completely isolated to like the downtown or the CBD areas, but it is still mostly concentrated there. Yes. So I think on the payroll front, I don't think I'd characterize any of this as like low-hanging fruit left. I think this is really just the strategic execution of these initiatives. And if I sit here today, I would tell you, we're probably about 2/3 of the way from many of these centralized initiatives, and that usually yields kind of that efficiency in the on-site payroll team as we start sharing and leveraging resources across assets. So I'm pretty optimistic that as we work our way through 2023, there's probably 1/3 of the work left to be done with centralization and it's going to continue to yield kind of the benefits that will help mitigate some of the pressures that we're feeling. Yes. So Robin, this is Michael. Maybe let me just give you a little context overall around the eviction moratorium and kind of what we're seeing today relative to that activity. So for the most part, the moratoriums have generally expired. We still have a couple of these local areas in California where there's various proof of hardships and restrictions. And all of -- most of these exceptions are set to expire in the beginning of early 2023. I'm going to tell you right now that the teams today are all over this process of continuing to work with these residents who've experienced hardship. And once we've exhausted all those options, we're ensuring that we have everything filed properly. We are still in the very early stages of this eviction court process. And we are starting to see some traction where the courts are actually moving through and following through kind of with lockouts. Overall, this level of eviction activity in the portfolio is just -- it's not that material, and we typically average less than like 1% of our move-outs from -- for this reason. So I would tell you, even if everything was accelerated through the court system today, the volume would be more than manageable and would actually be a huge positive to us given the strength in the demand and the confidence we have in being able to fill those units with paying residents. Short term, I think going specific to your question, sure. We're going to feel a little bit of this occupancy pressure or loss of occupancy pockets of Southern California. But again, the demand is so strong that we're going to quickly recover from that. And I don't really see it playing into kind of the pricing. And I think our view right now is that the expectation you're just going to see us gradually fall back into this pre-pandemic level of eviction activity as we work our way through 2023. Yes. So this is Michael again, Robyn. So the Seattle market today is renewing a little bit less than what we would say our historical averages would be. San Francisco is -- again, it's more in line, but it's also a little bit lighter from a foot traffic and a application volume standpoint, both markets demonstrate demand. And I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's just at a little bit lower, more price-sensitive level than what we would have expected. But when we're looking at this volume and comparing it to like '19 week after week, we are seeing the foot traffic. We are seeing the conversions to applications. It's just at a little bit less of a price point. And our hope right now as we get through this fourth quarter and turn the corner into the year, we will see this retention start to improve and take a little bit of the pressure off of the front door, and we are seeing slight trends of that right now, but we need a little bit more momentum and time to kind of clarify on that. Yes. So this is Michael. Let me start with Seattle and San Francisco. So I think clearly in Downtown Seattle, we're feeling some of the pressure from the new supply in that market. And San Francisco, like I said, I think earlier in one of the responses to a question, maybe a little bit in South Bay that they had a lot of supply. These markets are set to deliver less supply next year, so taking a little bit of the pressure off. And maybe with that, I'll just transition to kind of an overarching view of supply for '23, which is for us, we're very focused on this concentration, the proximity of the new supply and from an operations standpoint, when are the first units going to actually start hitting the market to be leasing. And when we look forward, these expected starts in '23 relative to the proximity within like 1 or 2 miles of our locations is lower than previous years, which is a really good indicator that we should continue to feel less pressure from the new supply being right on top of us. Specific to '23 deliveries, I would say that the overall direct pressure will be less. But clearly, like the D.C. market stands out as needing to see marked improvement in absorption because it has like another 15,000 units coming online with slightly more of an impact from a competitive standpoint to our portfolio. And then outside of D.C., look, we're going to have some pockets in L.A. like Wilshire, Koreatown, Hollywood, where we expect to have some pressure next year. And in addition to that, I think the Downtown submarket in Denver, we're going to face some direct kind of head to head. And besides those buckets, every year, we have these small isolated pockets of supply but as we look into '23, we just see that we're going to have fewer of those concentrated pockets, and we're just not going to have as much kind of direct pressure on us. And I think when we stand back and look at this, this portfolio with these amazing locations are clearly in places where affluent renters want to live and still have these good demand drivers and that definitely insulates us from some of this direct pressure from the supply. Yes. No, John, I was just going to point you right to that page. And if you look at kind of the month end rent numbers, down below in that chart, you can kind of get yourself a proxy to understand depending on which month you pick up the peak -- lease, it's 4% or 5% off of kind of that August number and just work your way through that. But I'll tell you, when you think about that Loss to Lease and you think about the shifts that have occurred with the deceleration in that number, it's really important to understand like that comparative period. If you're looking back to that summer period and saying, boy, you guys were 11% or 12%, and now you're sitting down closer to 5%, you need to remember that the majority of this decline is this seasonality that you can kind of see evident on Page 4, but also every lease and every renewal that we have done since that point, we are capturing that Loss to Lease that we shared from a while ago. And overall, the Loss to Lease it may be a little bit lighter than where we thought it was going to be a few months ago. But I'll tell you, just -- it is directionally and definitely right in the ballpark of where we modeled this thing for a few months ago. So we're just not seeing it. And I think that Page 4 really kind of highlights as to how you can think about that trend. Michael, this is Michael. So on a decoupling or even a recoupling basis, we're just not seeing a material change. I think during this pandemic recovery period we've alluded to on the last call, we saw a slight decline in like the average adults per household. We ran about [1.65] and we were down at like [1.57]. And that was really more prevalent in our one bedroom unit types where we used to have 2 adults and they moved into a 2-bedroom or did something different. So -- we looked at this even for the third quarter of these move-ins, which there's some seasonality of that when do the 3-bedrooms fill up and stuff like that. And we're right on par with where we were in the third quarter of last year. So we haven't really observed any of these material changes. But I'll tell you, we've got great insight into it. We're watching the transfer behaviors. We're watching roommate activity. We're looking at unit type preferences on our website for prospects. And we'll be on it if we see anything shifting, we just haven't seen anything shift yet. And then in terms of kind of the reasons for move out, I mean you alluded to the home buying, you're absolutely correct. That number is materially down. During the third quarter, we're at like 8% of our move-out sited, home buying is the reason for move out. That's compared to like a 12% norm. But we did see a tick up in that rent is too expensive as a reason we're up at like 25%. Part of that was by design. We said this at the end of the second quarter that we were going to be fairly aggressive in July and August kind of pushing these renewals and holding the line and getting people up to market. So we knew we were going to take a little bit of that hit, and we expected that number to go up. As we work our way through the fourth quarter and first quarter, my guess is we're going to continue to kind of see that number moderate down. But I don't anticipate seeing reasons for move-out to buy home, materially change at all. My guess is it's going to stay very low. Not a huge difference. I'll tell you in California where you had 1482 and you had some of the CPI plus 5 caps, maybe a little bit less, we're citing that because they were going out at 9% or 10% increases against the market that was up 19% or 20%. So those folks typically stuck around because they didn't have a lot of options. I look at like overall, I will tell you, when you just look and Mark alluded to this in his prepared remarks, is the health of the new residents moving into this portfolio from an income standpoint, our income -- rent as a percent of income is right in line at 19%, which, to me, kind of points to this fact that these new residents moving in are clearly going to be able to absorb kind of future increases that we push through into the portfolio. Yes. So I mean, overall, we're not seeing a significant shift of like urban and suburban. We look at migration patterns, where are people coming to us, where are people leaving and what is the renewal patterns look like? And there's nothing that really pops out. I think clearly, when you look at like a Seattle, San Francisco and some of these urban markets, we continue to see this trend where we are drawing in new residents from a wider area from outside of the states, from outside of the MSAs, which we view as a positive, meaning that these markets are continuing to draw people from all over kind of the country and even the foreign markets. But nothing that's really like a delineation that I can point to between urban and suburban that says they're acting materially different. Yes. So this is Michael. So I mean clearly, I think you cited a lot of those reasons in San Francisco and Seattle. Early on, there was an ambiguity around return to office. There's still a little bit of a kind of a sense of, okay, what does hybrid work really look and feel like across the tax. Clearly, you've seen the press releases out or the articles being written on all the recent announcements, which just creates a pause in people's minds around jobs and what are these folks doing with layoffs and growth. When I look at it right now, again, I think this is like a material -- immaterial kind of change that we're seeing. It's the markets that didn't really recover as much and I think what you're seeing is a market trying to hold on to rates where they are and use concessions more than let that rate kind of moderate down. Adam, this is Michael. Maybe I'll start and just hit on the occupancy and I'll turn it over to Bob to talk about the bad debt. So for us, when I'm describing healthy occupancy, to me, that's running in a range of 96% to 96.5%. And I think right now, it's too early for us to say. We'll expect in the fourth quarter, occupancy does tail off a little bit. You're seeing it in this portfolio. It's not unusual, what we're seeing. The health when you turn the corner into January and how we're looking and feeling about that intraperiod job growth is really going to be how we kind of put into our model as to what the expectations are. But right now, I will tell you, we still feel very comfortable saying that we expect next year to be in that range of what we would define as a healthy occupancy."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. As you could see from our press release, Equity Residential had an outstanding quarter. Our revenue results in the quarter were driven by steady occupancy, continuing strong renewal rate growth and decelerating but still above trend, new lease rate growth. We couple that with a continuation of modest expense growth leading the same-store NOI growth for the quarter of an exceptional 16.2%. With continuing positive financial leverage, this led to a 19.5% increase in quarter-over-quarter normalized funds from operations. We are proud to have improved margins and created substantial cash flow growth in the turbulent time in the economy. I congratulate my colleagues across Equity Residential for their hard work, taking care of our residents and their fellow employees and producing these impressive financial results. We know at this late point in the year, the focus naturally turns to 2023. As usual, we are not giving guidance at this time, but in the management presentation we posted last night, we tried to frame the material factors that will drive next year's revenue results.  In a moment, Michael will take you through those factors in some detail. We remind you that the success we've had in 2022 will create a challenging comparable period. So we continue to expect a moderation in 2023 annual same-store revenue growth even if as we expect 2023 as a strong above-trend year. Looking at it from the top of the house, we like our Affluent Renter customer and what we expect will be their financial and employment resiliency going into uncertain times. Our target resident is high earning and employed in knowledge industries, with more durable incomes and employment prospects. The college graduate cohort, which we believe makes up the vast majority of our residents has an unemployment rate of 1.8% and compared to the 3.5% overall unemployment rate. Even if layoffs materialize, we believe that the tighter than average labor market for these knowledge workers will allow them to find replacement jobs quickly. Finally, although high inflation has impacted everyone's real incomes, our Affluent Renter is relatively more insulated due to their higher incomes and lower rent-to-income ratios. The average income for the residents who signed new leases with us in the past 12 months is $174,000 or 12% higher than the group who signed with us in the 12 months ending September 2021. These new residents are paying us slightly less than 20% of their income in rent, which is generally consistent with prior rent to income levels. On the apartment supply side, we see national apartment deliveries reaching a cycle high point in 2023. However, in the coastal markets where most of our properties are still located, we see supply as being lower and being delivered further away from our properties than in the past and thus likely less impactful. The Sunbelt markets, including the Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing, will see higher relative supply numbers than our coastal established markets and likely more impact, especially if that's coupled with the job slowdown. For us, this may turn into a nice opportunity to acquire assets in these expansion markets, not necessarily at fire sale prices, but at better values than prevailed in the first half of 2022 when we felt the market was overheated and chose to stay on the sidelines. We continue to see our strategy of having more balanced portfolio between our established and expansion markets as appropriate as we follow our Affluent Renter to these new markets and mitigate regulatory and resiliency risks, from overconcentration in any market or in any state. In addition, other housing alternatives remain expensive and in low supply. Though they have been declining of late, current single-family home prices continue to be at record levels, while rising mortgage rates have further stressed affordability, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Single-family housing starts are declining, existing homeowners are more reluctant to sell due to low locked in mortgage rates along with minimal and expensive for sale replacement options and competition for homes from investors remain strong. Going against these positive factors for our business is a significant impact of inflation on the economy, where job growth goes in response to the Federal Reserve's actions as well as volatility in the capital markets, the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine and a myriad of other uncertainties. We are currently in an excellent spot but acknowledge that the risks and uncertainties are more elevated than usual. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Yes. Steve, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. It certainly has gone up. The 2 deals you saw us start this quarter were really things that were in play much earlier, and we were kind of obligated on. It's just the start that occurred. So we have let go of some deals we were pursuing. We have talked a lot with the development team about the higher hurdle. I'm not sure I have a precise number for you, but it was probably a number we were looking more like a 5% return on in-place rents. And now we're looking for something, Steve, probably a lot closer to a 6% return on in-place rents, but you've got deals where there might be a story that's particularly compelling. You like your basis play or some other factor that makes it particularly interesting. I'll also say the big competitor to development with us is acquisitions. I mean our sense is that pretty soon, pretty soon might be a few more months though, the acquisition market will be more available to us, again, not at free prices, not at fire sale prices. But boy, if we can buy existing streams of income without having all that development risk, we'll lean in on that. So my sense is that acquisitions of existing assets will be more available to us at more favorable prices than a correction in the development market. So to answer your question, I think the hurdle is higher for us to start new development both because of cost of capital and because of the ability to deploy that capital instead in acquisitions. Yes. And I'm going to take -- thanks for the question, Nick. I'm going to take cap rates and sort of make it in the values in general. I mean the system definitely got a shock. We talked about that on the last call. There's a pretty big bid-ask spread out there. Sellers are saying to themselves, 6, 9 months ago, I could have gotten a much higher price. I'm still getting good cash flow growth, as Michael Manelis just described. Maybe I'll sit on my hands for a while. And buyers are sitting there going, Wow, all risk assets have repriced, apartments should reprice too. So our sense is that this lack of activity, I mean, transaction volume is just really low now. It's really hard to peg value. But our sense is that cap rates have moved from maybe a 3.5% to something like a 5% cap rate for well-located stuff. And to your point, that still requires negative leverage, negative cash flow for a bit. So that is, I think, a problem. And that's why you don't see a lot transacting. On the flip side, people like the apartment business. I mean there is a real dearth of these sorts of inflation, protective investments in apartments, we've done a lot of research on this, have typically performed pretty well in inflationary climates. There's also, by our count, $375 billion or so of dry powder available in real estate private equity funds looking for a home and apartments are a favorite place to invest in. So we think there's a lot of supportive stuff but right now, there's just not a lot of transaction activity. And our sense is that, again, values are down probably 10% plus. And some of that reason, they're not down more is because of this offset from increasing cash flow. Chandni, it's Mark. Thanks for that great question. You really hit on it because you really need to split this into 2 pieces. What do you feel about the asset price, and we'll talk about that in a second. And where are you getting the money from. And so talking about asset price we already like where it's headed, where these assets are being talked about, again, not a lot of transactions, but a lot of these sales that are being discussed are -- don't have that big premium to replacement cost.  At the end of '21, the beginning of this year, we saw transactions where acquisitions were being done at 25%, 30% premiums to replacement cost. You saw us stand down. We just don't see a history of making a lot of money when you pay those kind of premiums. So we see the price change as having evaporated a good amount of that, and we see deals being talked about, at least for sale much closer to replacement costs. So we like that. So when we think about asset pricing, replacement cost figures in, the cap rate certainly figures in the price per pound. All those things matter to us. But where we get the money? Because we're going to continue to trade out of some of these existing markets, D.C., the State of California, New York, so where do those assets trade on a relative basis compared to these expansion markets. And if they trade in a way that makes sense to us, i.e., in a nondilutive way, that will be more interesting to us. In terms of deploying new capital, which would have to be raised with debt, right now, we think our unsecured debt rate is probably 5.75, something like that. That's a pretty mighty interest rate to overcome and cap rates being around 5 aren't going to push that. And again, looking at where the stock is trading, that doesn't make a lot of sense. So for us to be net acquirers is going to require, I think, some shift in our capital costs. For us to be swappers of assets like we've been, traders is going to require that trade to make sense and then for asset values to make sense. And they are starting to, on a replacement cost basis. But I think your guidepost 2018, 2019 is a pretty good guidepost because I think what happened in the pandemic with ultra-low rates, that was the distortion, but I also don't think very high rates is a permanent future either. All right. You had like a 4-part question, Haendel. And thank you. So I'm going to take parts of it all the way up to stock buybacks, and I'll ask Bob to speak to the refinancing plan for next year. So when you talk about immediate capital allocation, our hope is that we can accelerate our renovations a little more. We've got a lot of great, super well-located properties where we touch ups in the kitchen and bath and stuff, especially if rent growth is going to moderate for a bit, our experience has been that, that's a good time to do these renovations, then when things start to accelerate again, you've got some better product to sell. We're hopeful that, that also means that some of these labor pressures that we've alluded to and others have to, start to abate next year. You've got less action in single family.  Maybe there's an opportunity because we're really having trouble getting contractors and sometimes getting things like appliances for renovation. So renovation is a good use of capital. You should expect us to try and accelerate that. Again, these are all near-term things. Innovation expenditures, so this relates both to our terrific presentation inside the company this week about all we want to do relating to sustainability and whether it's solar panels and EV charging and all that. A lot of that stuff is pretty capital-intensive. A good part of it has some returns, which is great. Some doesn't. But I think we're going to -- you're going to see us lean in there, both as part of our thought process on ESG in general and because of the return and the demands of our residents. And finally, just the innovation part. We've kicked off a big data analytics push inside the company. That is expensive, both in terms of talent and outside help. In the long run, we think it will help us drive revenue, manage expenses better, run the business better in general. But those are all areas where we're spending money. On the share buyback, and you and I have had this conversation publicly and privately in the past, it's really hard, though, in this case to even think about it in a market where things are this uncertain. We just talked about how hard it is to peg underlying asset values. So to really understand the relationship of your stock to underlying asset values and sort of do that arbitrage you are referring to, is a very challenging thing right now. Doesn't mean that we don't think the stock has room to go up, certainly. But just at the moment, taking more risk, which would mean either issuing debt or selling assets into an uncertain asset sale environment. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. So I wouldn't say share buybacks are top of mind at the moment. And really just to give you some more color hand out, the existing rate isn't just the listed rate there. There are hedges that went with that portfolio. So the actual rate running through the P&L is. 4.25%. So when you think about your modeling exercise, as Bob said, for really what will amount to the last month or 2 of 2023 and then going forward, it's really the difference between 4.25% and wherever Bob ends up financing this. And we've got the luxury of another year to see if we can pick a spot to do that in. Yes. Thanks, Haendel. I don't have any thoughts on that just because the transaction pool is so light. There's so little going on in any market, just sharing anecdotally, a large national broker told us that a large southeastern apartment market, they didn't have a single listing at this time. So then that's unprecedented. So I just got to tell you, the markets are just not very liquid. And so for me to be able to peg Coastal or Sunbelt, I wish I could peg anything right now. I think right now, it's just a little bit of everyone feeling each other out. What's the Fed going to do? How is that going to feel? Do operating results hold up? All of those things, and all, I think, are a little bit in flux. But as I said in my prior remarks, we're really interested in the relationship between those 2. And if we can continue to nondilutively trade, we will. Yes. Great question, Rich. It's Mark. So it would require us to think about another risk differently, too, and that's political risk because one of the things that our coastal markets have, I think, more of though maybe not quite as much of as we may have thought, is risk of rent control, risk of activity by politicians that's job destroying and growth destroying. So from our perspective, we'd have to be balancing that differently as well. There is no risk-free apartment market. So if you're in Texas market, you probably have less political risk, but you may have more resiliency risk and you certainly have a lot more supply risk than a lot of our markets. But our experience with supply in the locations we're trying to buy in and build in like Frisco, Texas is, you'll have a year or 2 of that, and then demand will need debt supply. So again, if you're telling me that prices get out of whack, that somehow the Sunbelt trades tight even with all that supply, that's probably not stuff we're going to be acquiring or building much of. But if the pricing relationship makes sense, then we're trying to manage this political risk versus the supply risk and I think balancing that out makes sense to us. So that's kind of where we end up on that. Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start, and I think Bob and Michael may end up correcting me. But I think that's the embedded growth in loss. You're talking about more of a Loss to Lease a little bit in there, and we split those 2 up. So if you think about it, embedded is the rearview mirror. Those are already contracts that have been written leases that exist. And in your example, that Loss to Lease is us writing up to market. So if January rents are say, relatively low. And then as we would expect, seasonally, they're higher in June and the lease you just referred to in June is written higher. That additional increment we were referring to is that Loss to Lease and has the intraperiod growth. So we're talking about the same thing. We just kind of compartmentalized it a little differently because it was a little easier to think about in 3 pieces. You had a one-part question and we split it into 3 parts, right? But we are just -- we're just chopping it up a little different because it seems to us, those are different variables and easier to explain, but I think you're on it. It's Mark. Thanks for that question. We were just with them last week, and they remain very committed to the joint venture as do we. Like us, they realize the market's moved and new deals have to hurdle over a higher number and have to make sense in this new environment. So they're adjusting, but there's no -- we sense no lack of commitment either on the personnel or capital side from Toll and there's none from us as long as the deals make sense. And I think that's the challenge right now. We're just not seeing deals that make sense because they're kind of priced in the old scheme. And as I said earlier in my remarks, the price system has changed and development yields need to be higher. Thank you all for your time on the call and your interest in Equity Residential, and we look forward to seeing everyone during the conference season. Thank you. Bye."

            "name": "Bob Garechana",
            "content": "Yes, slightly less than that. We have about $825 million of debt that is maturing next year that needs to be refinanced. $800 million of it needs to be refinanced as secured, of which we've got $350 million of at this point, very attractively priced swaps against it managing those -- the treasury risk. Chandni, it's Bob. I'll start with the payroll tax side. I think the most prevalent or probably the area that you see the most pressure already is really in some of our expansion markets, particularly Texas, where you're seeing an aggressive amount of kind of reassessment activity and kind of push. So I think that's going to be an area in the expansion markets where we don't have a ton of exposure at the moment, but where you will see more real estate tax pressure. The state of Washington is also one that is an area because it's been so negative, right? So real estate tax growth has actually been negative. So you have a really challenging comp. And the final area, I think, where you're going to see it is just we do have some 421-a step-ups in New York State, which will contribute to growth as we go into 2023. So a little bit of a mixed bag, but those are the 3 areas I'd call out specifically. And I'll pass it over to Michael, who will mention some of the initiatives on the payroll side. And then following up, big picture on the balance sheet, we feel very good about where the balance sheet is. We expect to actually end the balance sheet at record low net debt to EBITDA. By the end of the year, we'll probably be in the mid-4s. We're already at 5 as it is. So the balance sheet is in great shape, is very long duration, has limited kind of interest rate exposure, and we have almost no floating rate. So we feel really well positioned. As we think about moving into 2023, the component of debt or the piece of debt that is due or the majority of it is actually a piece of secured debt that is $800 million that was done originally in context with the Archstone transaction and has some structural requirements that will require us to refinance it. So what we're anticipating is that we'll refinance it in the secured market and then we put on some hedges, some attractively priced hedges to manage the interest rate risk. And thereafter, in '24, we have no maturities at all, so which is an anomaly, right? So when you look at the $800 million or so we need to do over the next 2 years, it's very manageable. Yes. So this would be secured pricing, which is actually inside of unsecured right now. So if you looked at the GSEs for -- and relatively low leverage because this is a very well-supported kind of pool, you're probably without regard to the hedges we have in place, you're probably in the 5.5 range, so about 25 basis points below what Mark had mentioned on the unsecured side. When you factor into the swaps that we already have in place that hedge a portion of it at kind of treasury rates that are effective around a 3, we should be able to execute closer to 5 or maybe even sub-5 depending on what happens. This loan matures very late in 2023. So we have a long runway before we actually need to refinance. 4.25%. And Robyn, it's Bob. Just to add real quick. If you think about those residents that are residing and not paying, they're fully reserved from a financial standpoint. So that occupancy -- that physical occupancy coming back into the market and us kind of capturing it like Michael just mentioned, is a dollar for dollar, 100% upside to financial results because whether it's $0.50 less a month or before, it's a full rental payment more than what's going through the financial statement. So it's a big net benefit. John, it's Bob. So just level setting real quick on earn-in/embedded growth, which we do think of them as pretty interchangeable. They don't have any regard to bad -- like this has no regard to bad debt, no regard to vacancy loss, now any of that. My guess is, and I'm not -- and maybe you can help me a little bit on how you're getting to your number is that you're maybe taking -- taking blended rates and kind of averaging blended rates over the year and coming up with that number is my guess on how you're coming with your 50 basis points higher than what our embedded number is. Is that how you're approaching it? Yes. And I guess what I would tell you is that the difference is really waiting. So the way that we're calculating it really has actual waiting day by day as to when leases are in place. So took my blended lease rates over the year and just kind of extrapolated and did a mid-quarter convention, et cetera, I'd probably come up with a number that's around a 5%. But if you actually do the pinpoint map, which we provided you, that's the 4.5%. That number shouldn't move almost at all. It's our forecasted number for the end of the year. So that number really shouldn't move much at all as we go into -- as we finish out the year based on our guidance. Does that help? Yes, I'll pass it over to Michael. I think if you look a good visual as I pass it over to him, is that pricing trend page, which is a couple of pages before, maybe Page 5 in the management presentation and you can kind of see that sequential trend, but that will help you directionally. And Michael, you probably have that. Yes. And from a bad debt standpoint, we do think over time that we should see a return back to kind of our normalized levels, which were pre-pandemic, the 50 basis points you highlighted. Just given the nature of our resident base and their rent to income ratios and all the positive things that we've talked about on this call. The challenge from a financial standpoint or a financial statement standpoint or something to keep in mind is that in 2022, we had about $31 million worth of rental assistance and that's not going to repeat itself in 2023, right? So in order for you to break even from a growth perspective on same-store revenue, organic kind of bad debt has to improve by at least $31 million, from there is when you would then see it start be a contributor to growth.  All that being said, we have seen improvement in just the actual payment from our residents every month kind of sequentially since June or so and would expect that trend to continue. But it's a little bit of a race between that trend and this bad debt or this rental assistance that we won't have in 2023. But we're optimistic that we will return over time to normalized levels. Yes, I'll start and Michael can add in if you like. I think in the areas that are controllable -- are most controllable, our innovation focus has really been on eliminating or reducing the amount of labor cost exposure, which has been something that has been very prevalent in the inflationary environment. So I think that we've done an excellent job of rethinking where we can use technology, where we can mitigate labor exposure, ours or contract labor. It doesn't really matter what labor there is just by being more efficient by using technology, by increasing visibility and a lot of the initiatives we've had have really helped us deliver what has really been record kind of payroll growth and has kept the R&M line on the contract side a little bit more in check, even though there are other pressures there. So that's certainly been a big help and something that we are going to continue to focus on as we go through generation, I'll call it, 3.0 of innovation. The other area that, in all candor has also helped us as real estate taxes, right? We have benefited from in our jurisdictions having lower real estate taxes overall, and that was, I think, very prevalent in 2022. Is not as likely to repeat itself as we go into 2023 because I think as assessors look back, they typically look back at historical performance, and we've had record performance in our markets in 2022. And so that's going to put pressure on the real estate tax side that is a little less controllable. And I guess the final part on real estate tax side is that in California, of course, you do benefit from Prop 13. So you've got kind of 2% baked in there. But in the other jurisdictions, we'll have some pressure."

In a minute, Michael will walk you through a performance update by market, then Bob will discuss our guidance improvements, update you on how our innovation machine continues to hold expense growth down in an increasingly inflationary world, and then Bob will close with some color on our balance sheet and then we will take your questions. Equity Residential had a tremendous quarter. Our business continues to benefit from terrific supply and demand dynamics, including excellent job growth and household formation. Our urban and dense suburban portfolio continues to be a magnet for our affluent renter demographic as demonstrated by our 96.7% same-store physical occupancy. We also believe that the desire for more space due to work from home and COVID-related health concerns has resulted in significant incremental household formation, creating additional demand for our properties. Also, housing alternatives remain expensive and in low supply. Single-family home prices reached record levels in 2022 while rising mortgage rates have further stressed affordability, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Single-family housing starts are declining. Existing homeowners are more reluctant to sell due to low locked in mortgage rates, along with minimal and expensive for sale replacement options and competition for homes from investors remain strong. The near-term apartment supply picture also remains favorable. Starts within close proximity to our properties in our coastal markets are still at or below pre-pandemic levels. In addition, it seems likely to us that over the next few quarters, new apartment starts should decline due to reduced availability and higher pricing of construction financing, increasing construction costs and continued supply chain disruptions, lengthening construction times and increasing developer risk. Recently elevated inflation numbers are certainly a concern, especially if efforts to rein in inflation lead to much weaker job growth. On the positive side, our affluent renter base should be able to better weather rising inflation in part due to lower relative rent-to-income ratios and higher amounts of disposable income. As in the past, if inflation does persist, we would expect the apartment business to perform relatively well. As we look at our resident income, the average incomes for our residents who sign new leases with us in the last 12 months is 13% higher than the group who signed with us in the 12 months ended June 2021. These new residents are paying us approximately 19.8% of their incomes versus 19.2% last year in rent. They are not rent stressed and they are willing to pay these rents to live in locations that support the lifestyles they seek to enjoy. On the larger topic of affordability, we see a continued need for more workforce housing and continue to support market-based affordable housing supply solutions, including zoning reform, public-private partnerships and other programs that assist in affordable housing preservation and creation. As part of this support and in addition to the more than 2,600 apartment units that we already operate in affordable programs, we have funded about half of our $5 million commitment to a privately held affordable housing preservation fund that expects to preserve approximately 1,600 affordable housing units when it\u2019s fully deployed. Now, switching gears to the investment side of our business, we saw a material slowdown in the transactions market during the quarter. Higher interest rates, especially for the floating rate debt used by many value-add buyers as well as general uncertainty about the path of the economy and evaluations led most buyers to pause. We did recently close on the sale of 2 properties in New York, 1 property for $266 million at a 3.3% disposition yield in the second quarter, and another New York property for $415 million at a 3.4% disposition yield this month. The properties are adjacent to each other on the Upper West side. Both properties represent pricing contracted for before the recent volatility in the apartment transaction market and our continuation of our stated strategy of lowering our New York market exposure. As we have said before, we will continue to have a meaningful exposure to the New York area, but intend to better balance our urban versus suburban exposure in our established markets like New York, while adding over time to our exposure to our expansion markets, which are attracting increasing numbers of affluent renters and have lower regulatory risks. For our part, we are very comfortable letting the transaction market sort itself out and have reset our transaction guidance so it reflects only buys and sales completed to-date plus one smaller disposition that is under a long-term contract that should close in the fourth quarter. While apartment values are not immune from the more general revaluation of risk assets going on across all asset classes, we expect apartment assets to remain in high demand from institutional buyers and for rising NOIs to partially cushion increases in cap rates. We have the balance sheet and the team ready to take advantage of any opportunities we do see as we have done in the past. Moving on to development, we started two new developments in the quarter. The first project is $153 million densification of an existing property we own in Santa Clara, California, about 1.5 miles from Apple\u2019s headquarters. We will be demolishing 40 units in buildings built in 1972 in a highly desirable area, with little supply of high-quality rental housing and replacing them with 225 new units plus significant amenities that will benefit the remaining 224 units at the property that are undergoing renovation. We are very excited about this project and expect a 6% development yield when it stabilizes. At a cost per unit of about $675,000, we also like our basis as compared to recent sales comps. We are also pleased to have started this quarter, our first development project with Toll Brothers. This $82 million, 362-unit project is being built just west of downtown Fort Worth, Texas in a rapidly gentrifying area with good access to job centers and to the increasing number of nearby lifestyle amenities like restaurants, bars and entertainment venues that are appealing to young well-off renters. We expect to build this property for about $225,000 per unit. We like our expected basis and we love working with a high-quality, financially strong developer like Toll that has the experience to capably manage construction and a climate with significant inflationary cost pressures. That said, this deal is approximately 75% bought out, reducing our risk. On current rents and costs, this deal has approximately a 5.5% development yield. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark. Let me start with a huge shout out to the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. They remain relentless in serving our customers and working together to deliver the strongest results in the history of our company. As expected, we had a very good second quarter. Resident turnover remains at all-time lows with strong demand driving robust pricing power and high physical occupancy at 96.7%. Pricing trend, which is the net effective price of our units inclusive of concessions, has grown almost 10% since the beginning of the year, which is well above the 6% range that it historically characterized a very good year. This pricing strength has contributed to an unprecedented new lease change with July expected to be about 16.5% and a significant loss to lease of 12.5%. July\u2019s moderation in the new lease change is less than we expected and is caused by a more challenging 2021 comparable period, not a loss in operating momentum as our sequential rents continue to grow. Our current position will contribute to continued above-average second half revenue growth and strong embedded growth for 2023. Our residents are well employed, and as Mark just mentioned, seeing their incomes rise. The unemployment rate for the college educated continues to be below 3%. And while we see the same headlines that you do about slowdowns in hiring or even layoffs, we are not seeing any impact on new leases or renewals. Our operating dashboards continue to flash green. Given the amount of hiring that the tech firms have done over the last few years, even with the moderation, they are still employing more people than they did pre-pandemic. The tenure of our residents has also improved to 2.3 years on average compared to 2.1 years last year and we are losing fewer and fewer residents to home purchase as single-family homeownership gets more and more challenging. In fact, in the second quarter, we had a 22% decrease compared to the second quarter of \u201821 in the number of residents who moved out to buy a home. We remain aware of the economic headwinds and we will position the portfolio more defensively if need be. But given the significant loss to lease, strong retention and healthy demand we are seeing, we remain optimistic. That said, as is true every year in our business, we expect rent growth to peak and then moderate seasonally in the summer, but we are happy to report that has not yet occurred. In sum, our operating metrics and forecast for the balance of the year remain beyond historical norms and Bob will provide more color on the building blocks of our revised guidance in his remarks. Let me take a minute and provide some color on market performance. In Boston, demand ramped up in both the urban and suburban submarkets driving a 90 base improvement in physical occupancy over the first quarter along with robust pricing power that came earlier in the season than usual. Rents have begun to moderate in this market. However, it is not uncommon to see modest reacceleration in August as students typically return then and are an important source of demand for our portfolio. We are definitely bullish on the second half performance, particularly in the suburban submarkets and remain cautiously optimistic on the city of Boston and Cambridge\u2019s ability to absorb some of the new units that are scheduled to be delivered later this year. The market continues to have strong employment with life sciences continuing to expand their footprint. New York continues with very healthy pricing power and demand. After significant impact from the pandemic, New York same-store revenue and NOI are now fully recovered back to 2019 levels. Physical occupancy is 97%. New lease change and renewal rate achieved were robust in the second quarter, with a vibrant environment continuing to attract our affluent renter demographic who is well employed and can afford to pay our rents. Despite these rental increases, our new residents are still paying us only approximately 18% of their income and our data indicates that our rents in this market have grown more slowly over the last 3 years of our new renters. The Washington, D.C. market continues to perform well, with physical occupancy at 96.7% and good growth in both new lease and renewals in the quarter. The absorption of new supply was good in the first half of the year, but we are keeping an eye on it as the year progresses. There are more than 12,500 units being delivered in 2022 with over 7,000 of them coming in the back half of the year from a competitive leasing standpoint. The absorption rate slowed a little bit in the second quarter, but still remains very strong and at current level, should support continued pricing power. While this market has historically shown high levels of supply, it is also one of the most resilient in the country during periods of uncertainty. The D.C. area unemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels and sits below the national average with good growth in the professional services and education health categories, where many of our residents are employed. Heading West, Denver has solid demand and good pricing power, stronger occupancy in the suburban portfolio and we expect some pressure from new supply in the downtown submarket. The Denver job market continues to enjoy healthy growth across a number of sectors, including the professional and business services. In Seattle, continued improvement on the quality-of-life issues is helping drive the comeback in the city, which now has rents that are just over pre-pandemic levels. Physical occupancy is above 96% and we continue to see strength in new lease rates and renewals. Concession use is isolated to the city and continues to moderate with approximately 20% of our applications receiving just under a month. This is down from over 50% from the first quarter and occupancy in the downtown submarket is now just over 96% as compared to 93% in March. Supply impact for us in 2022 is limited to our high-rise communities in the city, while 2023 shows less direct competition from new supply overall. This market continues to demonstrate high wage job creation. And while job postings from the major employers did moderate this quarter, the number of available positions is still near all-time record highs. The San Francisco market continues to improve with high occupancy supporting growth in both new lease and renewal rents. The issues around quality of life are improving, but Downtown San Francisco is still taking more time to return to pre-pandemic conditions than other markets across the country. Remember that the city was one of the last areas to ease COVID rules and just recently stepped up its focus on crime issues. While rents continue to be below pre-pandemic levels in the downtown submarket, they are working their way back. All of our other submarkets in San Francisco are at or above pre-pandemic pricing levels. Overall, I would say we are very optimistic on current trends in San Francisco, but have an eye on new supply that is expected to be delivered in the back half of the year and could erode pricing power if demand slows. Finally, Southern California continues to perform well, with physical occupancy at nearly 97% driving strong rental growth in both new lease and renewal rates. Specific to Los Angeles, the market is seeing elevated new supply as compared to the past several years, but the overall market remains undersupplied. Even in submarkets like Koreatown, where we expected pressure this year, the new supply is being quickly absorbed, leaving us better pricing power than we anticipated. On the delinquency front, we saw modest improvement in the second quarter in the payment behavior of our residents and continued rental relief receipts. As we look into the second half of the year, we don\u2019t expect rental relief receipts to be as material, which will lead to revenue growth moderation despite strong continued fundamentals. Before I turn it over to Bob, I just want to give a quick update on some of our innovation initiatives. Innovation is a major contributor to our ability to create operating efficiencies, while continuing to maintain a high level of customer service. Despite meaningful progress, we continue to have a lot of opportunity ahead of us as we integrate our initiatives, continue to leverage technology and advance our overall skill set. Just over half of our properties now operate without fully dedicated staff. We continued to invest in and implement software and processes that further enable the autonomous leasing experience, allowing customers to tour a community and interact with a member of our team or our AI leasing agent as much or as little as they desire. Self-guided tours continue to dominate as a preferred tour option, with just about 90% of all tours in the second quarter being self-guided. We are extremely excited about the future as we innovate to maximize revenue and minimize expense growth, while continuing to provide a great experience for our residents and employees. I will now turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Garechana: Thanks, Michael. A quick comment on the quarter before moving to guidance on the balance sheet. Q2 normalized FFO was $0.03 above the high-end of our quarterly guidance range. This beat was almost entirely driven by better same-store NOI through a combination of better revenue growth, including lower bad debt expense and modest overall expense growth. Now, for our revisions to full year guidance, as you saw in the release last night, we significantly revised same-store revenue and normalized FFO upwards while maintaining our existing same-store expense growth guidance. Starting with same-store revenue, strong first half performance, coupled with the constructive ongoing operating environment has led us to raise our same-store revenue projections above the top end of the prior range. We now expect our same-store revenue to grow between 10% and 11%. Our new 10.5% midpoint sits at 150 basis points higher than the prior midpoint driven by continued stable physical occupancy of 96.5%, record resident retention and earlier as well as stronger pricing power, both the new lease change and renewal rate achieved across all of our markets, but particularly in New York, where recovery from the pandemic has been a positive to the upside. Our revised full year same-store revenue guidance implies a slight deceleration in same-store revenue growth in the back half of 2022. This is the result of the significant governmental rental relief payments we received in Q3 and Q4 of 2021 and the almost complete absence of relief payments we expect to receive from the rest of this year, not any expectation of a slowdown in the core business. We expect third and fourth quarter same-store quarter-over-quarter revenues without the impact of rental relief payments to be more in line with the reported Q2 number. On the expense side, we left our already strong guidance unchanged with June year-to-date expense growth of 2.8% and a number of innovation initiatives underway, we feel confident in our ability to deliver second low expense growth for the full year. As you can see in our reported results, both real estate tax growth and payroll are aiding in our ability to accomplish this goal with some offset in utilities and repairs and maintenance. We remain laser-focused on reducing or eliminating exposure to inflationary labor pressures, whether we feel the impact from our own employees through the payroll line item or from contractors through the repairs and maintenance line. We strive to reduce any pressure from higher efficiency and better decision-making along with utilization of technology that can eliminate or permanently reduce labor hours needed. In a category like utilities, we do our best to maximize our resident reimbursement income, reduce usage through both education and technology initiatives and hedge our commodity exposure. Thus far, our approach has significantly buffered growth, but we acknowledge this is a long game if the current inflationary environment continues. Putting it altogether, the revenue and expense adjustments that I just outlined resulted in a 225 basis point increase for same-store NOI at the midpoint. For normalized FFO at the midpoint our guidance changes added nearly 3% or $30 million to normalized FFO growth, which results in an approximately 18% increase year-over-year for the company. A final note on the balance sheet before Q&A. Equity Residential continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector, characterized by low floating rate exposure and a long weighted average maturity. Subsequent to quarter end, we sent a notice to redeem the $500 million secured unsecured notes that are due in 2023 with proceeds from the dispositions of the two New York properties. This use of proceeds will mostly offset the normalized FFO impact of net dispositions for the year while also significantly reducing our refinancing needs in 2023. There is no prepayment penalty associated with the payoff, but there will be a modest write-off of historical discounts and costs, which is estimated on the guidance page. This write-off will be included in EPS and FFO, but not in normalized FFO. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first caller from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Mark, you touched on the transaction market a bit in the pause that you have seen there. If you were to estimate, how much do you think asset values have moved and maybe cap rates as well, obviously, NOIs are up? And then are you seeing any difference between markets maybe between expansion markets and some of your established markets?\nAlex Brackenridge: Hey, Nick, this is Alex. Well, as you know, the market is certainly unsettled right now and there is a lot of a feeling out process going on. So, there have been some transactions that closed. Some of those though were hard prior to the rate hikes, some of those maybe a buyer had 1031 needs. So, it\u2019s a little hard to get great clarity on that question. But clearly there is these countervailing forces that you mentioned interest rates up, economic uncertainty offset by just these tremendous property operations. So, I would say somewhere 5% to 8%, maybe up to 10%, where we are certainly seeing buyers scrutinizing things that might have a little bit of hair on them, maybe a lesser location, maybe a physical challenge that they might have overlooked before. So the range could get higher, but we also don\u2019t see a lot of distressed sellers, which lot of people are happy to keep enjoying the great performance that their properties are generating. So, it\u2019s a bit of a range, but we will see how it plays out, particularly come fall. It\u2019s a little slow in the summer as it typically has been.\nMark Parrell: And just to supplement that for just a second is just talking a little bit about replacement cost. I mean, that\u2019s a big differentiator. It\u2019s a mark between the coastal markets where the premium to replacement cost and a lot of assets were sold at was not significant or even in places like New York, there was little bit of a discount. And in some of the Sunbelt markets where there was a pretty significant premium to replacement cost and you saw us really slow down our activities when we \u2013 acquisition activities, when we saw some of those premiums go up into the 20%, 25% and up range over current construction costs. So, I guess one of the things, Alex and I am going to be looking at as we think about starting to buy machine up again is those markets \u2013 those Sunbelt markets start to make more sense on a replacement cost basis. That maybe because construction costs keep going up, that maybe because values come down a little bit but that is another input that\u2019s important. And it was one of the things that made us go a lot slower towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year, Nick.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe just on operations, you talked about July rents accelerating in the more challenging year-over-year comps and kind of the normal seasonality that we have seen historically, but maybe not yet. How is guidance thinking about kind of pricing in or kind of contemplating seasonality in the back half of this year?\nMichael Manelis: Yes, hey, Nick, this is Michael. So I think right now, where we sit and I said this in the prepared remarks that the moderation that we saw in some of the stats in July is actually kind of much less than we expected and that\u2019s really just given kind of the speed of that concession burn-off and rate growth from last year. And when we started looking at the modeling for the back half of this year, we are kind of just assuming normal kind of seasonal trends. And we have data going all the way back to 2008 to benchmark this rent seasonality that includes like the exact week when rents peaked each week, each year. And when we went back and looked and I said this in the prepared remarks, our rents have not peaked yet. And you see it over the time where you have had years where rents peaked in early July, all the way until like the very first week of September, but the most common kind of peak week has been somewhere in that first or second week of August. So as we were modeling kind of we just assume we are going to have rents peak somewhere in this first or second week of August and then have a normal kind of trail off in rents until you get to that January period.\nNick Joseph: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Mark, could you talk about some early reads, give us a lens into 2023, how should we think about the earn-in given just really strong back half that you are seeing right now, especially if we go into a tougher economic scenario like how should we think about the business and the cadence in 2023, because we obviously have a very good starting point and a foundation, but what if things get really bad from a macroeconomic standpoint?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. This is Michael. Maybe I\u2019ll start, and Mark, you can kind of add on, if you\u2019d like. But I think what you should expect is somewhere on our October earnings call, we will probably provide a little bit more of a range of the building blocks into 2023, that would include the earn-in. And by earn-in, for me, I use the term embedded and what that would mean is on 12/31 of this year, you would freeze the rent roll and assume that nobody moved in, nobody moves out and what does that revenue growth look like? I would tell you that in normal years, we would start January one-off with an embedded growth somewhere around 1% in the rent roll. And even with the forecasted moderation, it is pretty clear that our expected embedded growth is going to be well above kind of that average amount. So I guess I would point to the longer we go without having rents peak, right? It\u2019s just adding more growth to this embedded as every new lease and renewal gets written here in August, September and even October. And as you think about turning the corner, just factor in moderation and then your views for what intra-period growth could look like in 2023, and that\u2019s how we will be kind of doing the building blocks for our guidance for next year. But we\u2019re not at a point yet where we\u2019re willing to share those numbers because we still have a lot of transactions to write.\nMark Parrell: And you asked \u2013 it\u2019s Mark, this time, Chandni. You asked a very good question of let\u2019s say the economy does fall down a bit more and we do have a more \u2013 we actually have a set recession and how do we feel? Well, certainly, that would affect our numbers negatively. I mean job growth and economic growth are vital to the apartment industry\u2019s success over the long haul. But the supply demand environment for us is very favorable right now. And so the fact that single family is pretty pricey, the fact that, that means to us that our older millennial demographics going to stay with us longer, and you see that in our retention numbers. This Gen-Z group that\u2019s pretty large that\u2019s coming through the system where there just aren\u2019t enough jobs even right now. So if there is a few fewer because a lot of what we\u2019ve seen about the job market isn\u2019t that there is so many fewer jobs and people are unemployed. It\u2019s more that the excess is being taken out of the system. So I guess our sense is the supply demand balance is pretty good for us, and it will likely be pretty good unless a recession \u2013 if a recession occurs, is very severe. So the setup for \u201823, it just really is quite excellent, even if there is a recession. It just won\u2019t be as excellent, but on a relative basis, it will still feel, I think the revenue growth for us and for most of the industry really, really good.\nChandni Luthra: Very helpful. And if I could just get a quick follow-up. So obviously, the acquisition environment has taken a huge back seat here across the board. As we think about your expansion plans in the newer markets, how long do you think that gets pushed? And what are the levers? Can development at some point become a bigger tool in your arsenal as you think about getting scale in those newer markets?\nMark Parrell: Yes, it\u2019s Mark again. Development is one of the tools in the toolkit. I mean one of the things that\u2019s happening now that makes us happy not to have too large a development pipeline is if values do go down a bit here, Chandni, and there is portfolios for sale, and there is a discount available to us, you\u2019ll see us be very active and very aggressive in going out and grabbing those deals. So I think you\u2019re going to see it be pretty quiet for a few months here. My guess is that buyers and sellers will decide that this is the new market. And towards the end of the year, we might get considerably more active. We will continue to do development. We like a lot of the deals. We\u2019ve got a couple more we\u2019re likely to start this year. But I guess what I\u2019m most excited about is to see some of these acquisitions come in at a little bit more reasonable price, to be able for us to act on that and act in volume on that. So again, to us, it seems like it\u2019s going to be quiet kind of through Labor Day for sure, and then it might pick up a bit. Alex, what would you \u2013 I don\u2019t have a deadline for completing the transformation of the portfolio. I mean we will be reactive to the market opportunity. Do you have any...\nAlex Brackenridge: I would just add that in environments like this, we have a competitive advantage over some higher leverage buyers. So it\u2019s been very competitive. Everyone\u2019s bid was more or less the same in the last couple of years, now the ability to transact very quickly. We have our own management company, our due diligence is very fast, and we\u2019re all cash. So \u2013 and we have great relationships. And that\u2019s the thing we\u2019re doing right now is maintaining our relationships with our brokers and with principles. And when the time is right, we will move quickly and the machine will get ramped up again.\nChandni Luthra: Great, thanks and congrats on a strong quarter.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Now we will move on to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes, thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where renewal increases went out for August, September, I assume October is maybe a little too far out. But maybe talk about that? And then could you also talk about maybe, Bob, what\u2019s in guidance for the back half of the year in terms kind of blended spreads either by quarter or maybe for the second half in general?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So Steve, this is Michael. I\u2019ll just start and talk a little bit about the renewals. So yes, we definitely have kind of renewal quotes put out into the marketplace through the end of September and even into October. I said in the prepared remarks, we have a lot of confidence in this renewal process that we put in place. So right now, the quotes that have gone out in July and August, on a net effective basis, we\u2019re right around 12%. And we\u2019re negotiating somewhere right under that 200 basis point kind of spread. So we expect to achieve around 10%. I think that\u2019s a fairly good number to think about for the next several months. And even as you think about the balance of the year, you will see some moderation in that achieved renewal increase rate, but it\u2019s not going to be this material drop off. It\u2019s going to stay somewhere in that high single digit and maybe even to this low kind of double-digit range. But I think as we think about our process right now, we\u2019ve centralized all of the renewal negotiations, which has really kind of helped facilitating these renewal conversations and giving us a lot of confidence as we put out these quotes to really be able to project kind of what to expect from them.\nMark Parrell: And Steve, before Bob just gives you a little more elaboration on blended spreads and such, One of the things that\u2019s, I think, really interesting here on renewals is because in a fair number of jurisdictions, mostly in California, we can\u2019t raise rents to market that we\u2019re limited up to some jurisdictional limits, you\u2019re going to have some energy even if rents do decline a bit as they will seasonally and as they may due to the economy, I think renewals will be another positive in \u201823 because we\u2019re going to have markets where we continue to be significantly. In some cases, even 20% below the market even after an increase. And so if that 20% becomes 15%, it\u2019s still a pretty good size increase. So I think the fact that we haven\u2019t been able to meet the market on renewals probably leaves a little bit of gas in the tank in \u201823 too even if rents do moderate for both \u2013 and they will for seasonal reasons, but for economic reasons, I\u2019m sorry, Bob.\nBob Garechana: Yes. So I think Mark and Michael kind of gave you the blended perspective, which is in our guidance, so maintaining that kind of high single-digit renewal component. So they gave you the renewal piece, and I\u2019ll give you the blended, which really is the new lease. So we talked about the seasonality and the trend of seasonality in rents, coupled with that just hard comparable period in the back half of 2021 and that\u2019s going to lead your new lease and as a result, correspondingly, you\u2019re blended to moderate as you get into the back half of the year, which is what we\u2019re including in our guidance. That\u2019s very normal. I think the only abnormal thing here is what we\u2019ve modeled is something that remains positive on the new lease side. In a normal year, kind of pre-pandemic, new lease change often would go negative in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re incorporating in our guidance.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then maybe just a second question, sort of following up on the transactions and sort of change in cap rates, either Mark or Alex, where do you guys think kind of unlevered IRRs are today or where do you sort of targeting? And what do you think the market is targeting, realizing that cap rates can kind of be all over the board, but where do you think the current hurdles are?\nAlex Brackenridge: Yes. As I said, it\u2019s a little bit tough to know because it\u2019s pretty unsure footing right now. That is an answer we\u2019re looking for. On our end, we look a lot about what we can sell properties for. So we have some transactions in the market that we\u2019re considering, and we will see how pricing comes out on that, and that dictates it a lot. But clearly, it\u2019s higher than it was. I don\u2019t know if I have an exact number on that.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Alex, a follow-up question on the lack of price discovery, could you just help quantify the magnitude of the bid-ask spread right now kind of the ranges you\u2019re seeing? Are sellers\u2019 expectations 5% above buyers or 20% above buyers right now?\nAlex Brackenridge: Yes. John, it\u2019s Alex. As I said, it varies a lot and well-located, clean properties. I think it\u2019s closer to the 5-ish on something that\u2019s more complicated maybe as a physical issue, maybe got a lot of vacant retail. It\u2019s going to be higher than that. But that\u2019s the number people are feeling each other out and they really don\u2019t know. And I think it\u2019s a time just to be patient, which is what we\u2019re doing and most sellers \u2013 most sellers and buyers are doing that right now. So there is some assets that have just been pulled off a market because there is not a lot of traction, but there is a whole bunch of money on the sidelines, as you know, and there is a lot of people that are, frankly, right now hiring up because they expect to buy more apartments in the future. So I think that this will settle itself out but there is a range right now to answer your question of pricing variance between the buyer and seller expectations.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thanks. Bob, one question for you on expenses, can you just give us a little bit of color on the real estate tax backdrop right now, basically 0% growth year-to-date. Is there any unusual appeals benefiting the expense line item in real estate taxes? And any color on what type of step changes we could expect going forward would be helpful?\nBob Garechana: Yes. To be honest with you, it\u2019s less about appeals in 2022 than it probably has been historically and more about just lower assessed values we came into the year, particularly in a place like Washington state, where we had lower assessed values and where rate wasn\u2019t particularly high either on the real estate tax side. So that\u2019s really been the driver of keeping it more modest. The real estate tax market is typically a laggard. So it usually delayed relative to like market values in other places. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing play out in 2022. As we look forward into 2023 and not giving guidance, we\u2019re just setting the tone for the environment, I think it will become more about appeals because I think the recovery and what\u2019s happening in the broader kind of valuation and market is more apparent. And so I think it will be more what I call hand-to-hand combat with the assessors of you think that value is X, I think value is Y and let\u2019s appeal. So I think that\u2019s going to change the dynamic in 2023 and going forward.\nJohn Pawlowski: Alright. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will move on to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I just kind of wanted to hear your thoughts on the supply outlook for 2023 any kind of markets where you\u2019re seeing more supply or less supply?\nAlex Brackenridge: Yes, there is a range. I mean, certainly, New York is the poster child for lower supply. But there are other markets, too, like Orange County and San Diego that are seeing a drop off in supply. Markets that have continued high supply include Washington, D.C., Denver has a lot of supply, Austin and Dallas and more moderate are Atlanta, Seattle and Boston. So it varies a lot across the market. And overall, it\u2019s pretty steady. Looking at 2024 though, it gets \u2013 \u201824, \u201825, it gets more complicated and harder to project. And we see a lot of permits that have been pulled. But we\u2019ve looked historically, and when times get a little uncertain like this. There is a big drop off. I mean, historically, permits translate into starts like 80% to 80%, 80%, 90%. But when times get tough, that drops to 40% to 50%. So that\u2019s what might happen over time here as the \u201824, \u201825 deliveries decrease.\nJoshua Dennerlein: One follow-up on that with New York City, the 421a program expired. Just kind of curious if you\u2019re hearing anything maybe if there is any kind of replacement program that might come to influence the supply outlook on a longer term basis or just how you might think about some of the projects that might have [Technical Difficulty] program and yes?\nAlex Brackenridge: Yes. No, it doesn\u2019t feel super optimistic. There was a proposal that got rejected. So at this point, there is some discussions, but nothing imminent.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay, I will leave it there. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: Hi, everybody. I was curious if you could talk about the use of the disposition proceeds to take out debt versus something else like a repurchase or an alternate use of capital?\nMark Parrell: Hey, Brad, it\u2019s Mark. So we certainly have the capability to buy the stock back, and we get that. As we\u2019ve talked about on these calls in the past, it\u2019s a bit of a different thing for REITs than it is for most corporates because we don\u2019t retain earnings. So to do a real buyback, again, it requires you to sell a bunch of assets, which we did do or incur a bunch of debt. And from our perspective, paying off the debt helped us address the \u201823 maturities. It gave us optionality to buy the stock back later. We used up really all of our capability. So we have a little bit of a flex each year in our ability to sell assets and retain cash. And we really used all of that up with these two sales. So we thought, you know what, we will pay down this debt, we will retain this capability. If the Board decides it wants to buy some stock back later, we will have that opportunity. But those opportunities are just so few and for REITs, you start to descale the enterprise. It\u2019s just not as easy a decision as it is for, say, a big technology company with tons of retained earnings. And we got a big $900 million-plus dividend. And that\u2019s really where we think the cash return to the shareholder is. A lot of these other folks that talk about buybacks more readily are corporates that don\u2019t have dividends and do a lot more buyback activity as a matter, of course. So we did consider it, it\u2019s an option by paying some debt off, we retain that option.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then I was wondering if you could talk about what\u2019s happening with sort of the deal seeker tenants in New York, the new lease change was 38% in the second quarter. I know across the portfolio, turnovers remain low, but are you seeing those people leave?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So I would say, look, our record low turnover, we had 11.1% reported tax turnover in the second quarter, which is the lowest turnover we\u2019ve reported for a second quarter in the history. You are starting to see and we even said this, acknowledge this a little bit in June through some of the conversations we had. You are starting to see a little bit of price resistance from some folks that came in with the deal early on in this recovery, they were renewing at the exact same pace. And by deal seekers, I mean people that came in that received concessions, really discounted rent. What we saw right now when we looked at the move-out behaviors in the second quarter, we saw a slight uptick in people citing that the increase was too expensive, and that was the reason they were moving out. And I think specific into New York, we definitely saw some folks from Manhattan kind of give us that notice and then move over into kind of that Jersey City area and taking advantage of some of the rent arbitrage there, just at that lower price point. But overall, I would say the renewal percent, the percent of residents renewing remains really strong. We\u2019re either at or right above like these historical averages for this time of the year. And we really just haven\u2019t seen us bumping up against this kind of affordability question that\u2019s been out there. And the rent as a percent of income in our portfolio remains very constant which means that the income for our residents is definitely keeping pace kind of with the rent increases that we\u2019re seeing across the markets.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the time. I just want to maybe ask a bigger picture question a little bit. Look, I think when we kind of think about historical rent growth, right, it was kind of in a different \u2013 or potentially different inflationary regime. And look, I think we\u2019re certainly not expecting inflation to kind of continue with these year-over-year levels. But even if we kind of do settle out a kind of higher year-over-year inflation increases than maybe what we\u2019ve seen historically, maybe kind of walk us through how you would view rent growth in that type of environment relative kind of historical rent growth?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Hey, it\u2019s Mark. I\u2019m going to start, and I think some of us might \u2013 some of the others might supplement because we\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this over time. So we went back and looked at periods of time when there was more significant inflation. So again, this will be more like the \u201880s and parts of the \u201870s and even into the \u201890s. And I guess I\u2019d say our ability to reset rents every year, the pretty good supply-demand dynamic, in fact, very good we have currently. I don\u2019t have a number for you. I would have normally said that normal trend growth for EQR on the revenue line is 3.5%. And I would tell you that with inflation the way it is, the numbers are likely to be a fair bit higher because supply and demand are still also good. We could have a ton of inflation. If you have a ton of supply in a submarket, you\u2019re still not moving your rents. But we\u2019ve got good demand, single-family sectors, not drawing residents away. So the way we\u2019re feeling about it is that we\u2019re going to be able to provide a pretty good margin to whatever the inflation numbers are especially as we expect them to sort of settle down. There is also this little bit of a circular reference thing where rent is something like third of the CPI. So we feed into that number, and that number feeds into our number. And so there is a little bit of that as well. But I think you should expect that apartments, especially our portfolio, are optimized in a way with our pricing engine that we can continue to have a real return that exceeds the rate of inflation. So if you think inflation is 5, then I think our growth is going to be a margin to that number, above it. I think the other part of that question or that answer, though, is what are you doing with your expenses, because we do feel the pressure on wages and other things. And that\u2019s why we had both Michael and Bob address that issue with you because we need to keep our margins constant or growing and not just give it all the way on the expense side, and I think we\u2019re doing an exceptionally good job of that.\nAdam Kramer: That was really, really helpful. I appreciate all the color. I think just a quick follow-up, if I may. I think physical occupancy that says held in here with the market well and 96.5% in July is a pretty notable number. Just wondering how you guys kind of think about the renewal versus kind of occupancy kind of trade-off? Renewals have decelerated a little bit. It sounds like they can maybe kind of stay at this 10% growth here, but a little bit of a deceleration versus what they were in 1Q and 2Q. Just maybe walk us through kind of the trade-off between occupancy and pushing renewals a little bit more, maybe?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So well, I think we\u2019re always pushing the renewal front because we\u2019re quoting kind of where street rents are and then we\u2019re having these dialogues and pretty much holding the line. When somebody does move out, so if you don\u2019t renew that resident, you are absorbing vacancy loss. So that definitely starts to come into some of that equation. If you just step back and think about the occupancy of this portfolio, I mean, when demand is strong and the front door is strong, you have a lot more confidence to hold the line into kind of this renewal process because if that resident does move out, you\u2019re able to fill them very quickly at these high rates. So for us, if the demand picture stays as strong as it is, I would expect our portfolio is going to maintain strong occupancy. I think we should allow occupancy to probably trail off a little bit into that fourth quarter, but I think it is going to remain relatively strong. So when we look at the difference between new lease and renewal, I mean, we want to retain our residents, we want to retain our residents at a fair price. If the front door is not as strong, you will see us start to negotiate more into that renewal process. But if the demand stays as strong as it is, you\u2019re going to see us kind of hold the line with these renewals.\nAdam Kramer: Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will move on to Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. I just wanted to touch on bad debt for a minute. I think you said that was part of the beat versus your guidance on the quarter. And I know you break that out and the supplemental I think was about 2.5% net benefit to same-store growth on a GAAP basis this quarter. How should we think about the back half of the year and that level of \u2013 is it still a benefit year-over-year just from a modeling standpoint, how we should think about that?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So I\u2019ll start with the last part first and then highlight a couple of things about the quarter. So from a year-over-year standpoint, our guidance assumption is that it has no impact to growth meaning that we think that bad debt, net of governmental rental receipts and all of the above is the same in \u201822 as what it is in \u201821. What you\u2019re seeing in the second quarter is really the volatility in timing because you will recall from the first quarter that we had a little bit of a harder time with bad debt and then we had a better time in the second quarter, etcetera. So this number can be fairly volatile. As you get into the back half of the year, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the rental relief programs are winding down. So we don\u2019t expect a lot more rental relief money in the back half of the year. We got a lot of it in the back half of last year. So it\u2019s going to be a little bit of a headwind to year-over-year growth in the back half. But from a full year standpoint, again, shouldn\u2019t have any impact.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Just \u2013 and Bob will correct my specific numbers here, but I think we got in the back half of last year, $34 million or so in the same-store set in rental relief. And our modeling is something like $2 million for the back half of this year. So when we talked in our prepared remarks about how we see the strength continuing, what obscures some of these numbers is just these pretty significant rent recoveries from the government that tend to be kind of lumpy. So to see in the back half of the year, a negative impact year-over-year on all this bad debt stuff but you\u2019re going to see the continued strength, we think, in the underlying occupancy business. rate, all of that stuff, occupancy is staying high, that\u2019s going to offset that and keep those numbers pretty consistent, Nick, going forward.\nNick Yulico: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Just one other one is on renewals and just how to think conceptually about how you guys are thinking about that ability heading into next year? I mean you talked about right, high occupancy, not that much supply impact. It\u2019s been low turnover in the business. So as you\u2019re thinking about the numbers right around 10% right now on renewals, I mean, what pushes that number down at all, I guess, over the next year. When do you start thinking, hey, we\u2019re pushing for too much of a renewal notice here?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Well, this is Michael. I think it\u2019s really a function of where our market rents. So what happens to intra-period rent growth next year is really going to dictate a lot around where these quotes go out. But I think Mark mentioned earlier on the call, when you think about some of these regulations that we\u2019ve been bumping up against this year, those regulations are actually going to help fuel renewal growth next year because it\u2019s clear we\u2019re going to be able to be quoting increases beyond what intra-period rent growth is just to catch up to the market through that. So in our modeling, yes, you\u2019re going to have a little bit of this tail off in this achieved renewal increase because you have to assume that market rent prices seasonally do decline. They have declined every single year since 2008. At some point, you hit a peak and then you have some sense of moderation through 12/31 of the year, and then you start the cycle all over again. So that moderation is going to yield some softness in the quotes that go out the door. But again, it\u2019s very marginal. It\u2019s still going to be very high single digit of this low kind of double-digit. And then as we get into this October call, we will kind of give you our view as to how we think this is going to play out into 2023. But again, we got a little bit of a boost coming to us from just being able to catch up from all the regulation restrictions that we\u2019re faced with today.\nNick Yulico: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As we look at the rent growth over the last several quarters and also looking forward, there is kind of three factors at play, which we\u2019ve talked about, which is kind of the overall rental market, tougher comparisons and the presence or lack of government subsidies. So we\u2019ve touched a little bit about the government subsidies through the back half of the year. But I guess, as we think about just going forward and the ability for rents to continue to grow on this tougher comparisons like the government subsidies, like what\u2019s the thought process on the continuation of this and how much of the deceleration can kind of be expected just based on these tougher comparisons as you move past, as you lap some of the stronger growth?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I mean this is Michael. I think you are hitting on a couple of points. So, even when you look at the data and you see some of that rate growth deceleration that occurred like on the renewal quote. A lot of this is just a function of that comp period from last year. And just to remind everybody, last year, when we hit July, that was the first time that our new lease change went positive. June of \u201821, we were negative 50 basis points, July of \u201821, new lease change went to positive 6.9%. So, a huge 740 basis point improvement in one month in just that new lease change. And then from that point forward, it\u2019s sequentially approved every single month that new lease change and then fuel blended. So, as we think about where we sit today, you have to, like I said before, we have to allow for rents to moderate. The price in the market will moderate between now and the end of the year. In a normal year, I would say it\u2019s somewhere in that 3% to 3.5% range is where kind of the market rents after you peak whichever week you peak at, you will allow some moderation to the end of the year in the tune of about 3.5%. But then when you look at where we are at with the changes that we were seeing last year sequentially, that is what\u2019s going to fuel this moderation in our blended rate that we will be putting up in the third quarter and fourth quarter. But all that being said, where we land after the moderation, where we land after these tough comps is still significantly above historical norms.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And my second question is on the kind of the expectation of expenses. You are coming off of \u2013 you have some of the lowest expense in the market. Your \u2013 the expense comparisons get a little bit tougher in the back half, and you have been able to manage it quite well. Just as we think about the sustainability of controlling the expense line in the intermediate term, especially kind of in an inflationary environment. Do you have any thoughts on how you can kind of sustain the strong performance over the intermediate term? Thanks.\nBob Garechana: Yes. I think the core driver that will be consistent throughout is kind of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which is just reducing our exposure to labor pressure, whether it\u2019s in the payroll line item where it\u2019s the most obvious, right, which you see us having put up were literally probably on the 4 years in a row of either sub-1% or negative kind of payroll growth, we still have opportunity there, right. And so I think that\u2019s the engine of innovation and utilization and technology, and we will be able to completely or continue to sustain that kind of lower than inflationary growth going forward. That should also parlay itself into repairs and maintenance to a degree, too, because you get that benefit because there is a labor component embedded there with contractors, etcetera. So, I think that\u2019s the driver of where I think we have the most containment opportunity. Clearly, as you move into future years, real estate taxes will get harder from a comp standpoint and probably won\u2019t be as sustainable. But comps like utilities should get better, we hope hopefully that the commodity inflationary pressure that exists in the world today is more temporary than permanent. And so that should help us and hopefully offset other line items that might return to more normal growth. But again, the controllable part is really the labor hours, the payroll, the technology, the innovation, and that\u2019s where we are focused.\nMichael Goldsmith: And just a quick follow-up on that. How much more runway is there? Is this like another year or 2 years, or is this kind of a multiyear pathway where you should continue to benefit from that?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Well, this is Michael. I think from the operating efficiencies when we think about payroll benefits, I would say we are probably getting closer to the middle innings of our runway. And I said before, like when we talked about kind of we think we have identified $25 million to $30 million that\u2019s going to roll in over the course of 2023 and 2024 front half-loaded with kind of more of the expense opportunities and then it kicks into the initiatives focused on enhancing revenue. So, I look at the expense stuff and I would say we are probably in the middle of the innings there, but we are in the very early stages of the benefits from the revenue lifts on many of the initiatives that we are focused on.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Hey, Mark. On your commentary on the market dynamics in the Sunbelt, with pricing above replacing cost, this dynamic continues and it seems like both public and private peers are very active in the market. How will that impact your repositioning strategy? Will you focus more on development, or do you perhaps look at suburban markets or other markets in Sunbelt?\nAlex Brackenridge: Hey John, it\u2019s Alex. In terms of pricing moderating, so that\u2019s making acquisitions look relatively more attractive. If that continues, construction costs go up, then we would lean more towards acquisitions, but we are also focused on development, too, as an important component of fleshing out the portfolio. So, I would expect we would do a little bit of both depending on the circumstances.\nMark Parrell: And just to add, we are buying in suburbs of places like Dallas too. It isn\u2019t mostly or even close to mostly in all urban portfolio. We are trying to construct in Atlanta or Austin or Dallas or Denver. So, we are spreading our capital out. And that\u2019s where development can be really handy is in some of these suburban locations where it might be hard to find a property to buy.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And then Michael mentioned in the Q&A about effective lease growth trending around 10%, give or take. I wonder 200 basis points in the next few months and maybe softening towards the end of the year. But my question is, is this already embedded in your same-store guidance, or have you accomplished this as upward bias to your same-store revenue?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So, this is Michael. Let me clarify. So, the numbers that I was quoting before is the achieved renewal rate off of the offers that we put out there, where we believe that is going to be around this 10% for the next several months. And when we think about kind of the midpoint of our guidance, Bob pointed to this earlier, we are allowing some moderation in the new lease change and we are factoring in fairly consistent achieved renewal rate increases based on what we can see with a little bit of moderation in the fourth quarter just based on kind of normal seasonal decline in rate.\nJohn Kim: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we will move on to Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I want to get back to what you said earlier about normal earning for the following year is 1%. And so you are thinking it will be something more than that. I guess that\u2019s helpful. But maybe if we can dig into that a little bit more. So, how linear is the relationship between blended rate and their earning. In other words, like for the 1% typical for the earning that you described, what does that assume or what does that imply in terms of the blended rate in the previous year. And if we were to just do a ratio, would it be correct to assume that if it\u2019s 5x more this year than the earning will be 5x more or is it not that simple?\nMark Parrell: Not that simple.\nMichael Manelis: It\u2019s not that simple, but I will correct you. I think I did say it\u2019s going to be well above average. Well above that\u2026\nMark Parrell: Then scratch the quarter.\nMichael Manelis: Maybe that\u2019s a little more helpful. Yes. Look, again, I said this earlier. We are still writing a lot of leases, right. You still got a lot of activity coming through the rent roll. I think it\u2019s clear that we have got the right setup in place for a really strong year next year based on the fundamentals of loss to lease, looking at where this embedded growth is today, looking at the strength in the market, knowing that rents haven\u2019t peaked out yet. So, I think you just got to hold off and give us until October, and we will give you a little bit more clarity into the ranges of these building blocks, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as pure as like there is a direct one-to-one relationship between blended rate and kind of where that embedded growth is on 12/31.\nRich Anderson: I am aware there is many more variables, I was just trying to get to perhaps a more precise number. And then the second question I have is you talked, Mark at the early stage of single-family rental \u2013 single-family home affordability helping the apartment business. Do you have your eyes on any sort of replacement competitive pressures. If it\u2019s not buying a home or whatever the reasons are, top five reasons are the people move out. What we have this time around, which is somewhat new is single-family rental as an option for people that are \u2013 millennials that are \u2013 that have families that need more space and so on. So, do you have your eye on like kind of a change in the competitive landscape outside of conventional multifamily that is sort of on your radar screen right now is something to watch?\nMark Parrell: Yes, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for that \u2013 that\u2019s a very insightful question. We thought a fair bit about it. We wondered if it isn\u2019t similar to buying something you do as a lifestyle decision. I mean people mostly buy homes, not for financial reasons, but lifestyle. They have the second kid, they got married or had some other life change that requires them or makes them feel like, we will do the commute, we will do what we need to do to have the lifestyle we now need to have with the family situation we now have. I think that single-family rental does feels the same way that people will be similarly attracted to it, not because they have died them all along, but because they are really at a point where they have two kids and they are living in an urban environment, and that\u2019s just more challenging for them or whatnot. So, I think about SFR as more of an additional competitor for sure, but having the same drivers as just purchasing a home. In terms of other competitive threats, we have definitely benefited from people wanting more space and decoupling. We do see that people will accept roommates and live in other situations. So, just switching to another thing that could be a demand negative for us, it\u2019s possible that it will go the other direction. I mean it is certainly something rich that could happen where folks decide they will take on the roommate. They are not as afraid to the pandemic, and they will do that. We are not seeing any of that, but that would be another way you could see demand decline. But I don\u2019t \u2013 these SFR homes are mostly, it seems to us a replacement for single-family owned housing, not a new \u2013 like an entirely new source of competition.\nRich Anderson: In the past, EQR got in front of some of these things. Whether it was rent-to-own programs or what have you. What do you think about single-family rental, I mean as a place where you and your peers might start to dip your toes in over time?\nMark Parrell: Yes. That\u2019s a really interesting question. I mean we had a version of this conversation, if I remember a couple of quarters ago. But it\u2019s part of our job. And your question implies it to be looking at every subsector in the residential space. I think single-family rental has certainly established itself as a very legitimate long-term business. A lot of our former executives worked in that space. We do pay attention to that space. It\u2019s very interesting in that regard. Our primary focus right now is running this big apartment business we have. But we will keep our eyes open. And I guess if something wanders buy, we will act on it. But again, we are getting a lot of benefit right now and people moving into these cities again, and we are focused mostly on that at this point.\nRich Anderson: Thanks so much.\nMark Parrell: Thanks Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey there. Thank you. Appreciate the time. A couple of quick questions for me. First one on the expenses. Certainly sounds like technology and operating efficiencies are helping offset their pervasive cost headwinds. A couple of questions on that. Maybe you can remind us or update us on how far along you are in the technology implementation and efficiency plan that you talked about in the last few quarters? And then secondly, I am curious if you are seeing any distinction in OpEx between your urban and suburban assets? Are you finding it more efficient perhaps to operate urban high-rise versus suburban assets given perhaps less acreage to maintain fewer HVAC? Thanks.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So Haendel, this is Michael. I guess I would just start \u2013 I think I just went through a little bit of this as to where we are, which is from the efficiency standpoint on the operating platform. I would say that we are probably getting close to the middle innings, midway through. We have got a lot of the base technology installed. We are still working through some of kind of the smart home technology or access into units that we will add to some more efficiencies. You got half the portfolio running today without fully dedicated teams there. So, we have still got a little bit of opportunity kind of left to layer in the technology and create more efficiencies in the property management side. But for us, we are more excited right now because we are still in the early stages of the lift that we see from layering in technology into the income side of our business, the revenue growth engine, and we are in the very early innings of that of laying out all of these initiatives. And that benefit really comes in, in late \u201823 and into \u201824. But I think what you will see is you are going to see us continue to kind of mitigate some of the inflationary pressures on OpEx by just continuing what we have laid out in course of leveraging technology to create the operating efficiencies that will mitigate some of the expense pressures in 2023. And then you will see the engine kick in and switch more to the revenue lift.\nHaendel St. Juste: Any color on OpEx trends or comparisons between urban and suburban assets?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I mean I guess I would look into some of the high-rise portfolios and say, you typically would have more staffing there. You have concierge, you have more labor pressure. You clearly have more dependency on some contractors relative to elevators and things like that. So, I guess I haven\u2019t looked at the number, but I would be surprised if we don\u2019t see a little bit more growth in the high-rise portfolio than we did in the suburban garden style.\nMark Parrell: And Juste, its Mark. To add to that good question you have there. I mean the CapEx load, for example, and I know you referred to expenses, but the CapEx load is spread on a high-rise usually at much higher rent than the Garden one. So, you might be doing things with chillers and you might be doing things, but there is one roof, not a multitude of roofs. There is no landscaping. So, putting aside real estate taxes, margins I would think the labor only margin would not be as good in a high-rise because of usually higher service standards. But I bet just some of the CapEx with the higher rents is a lower percentage of each rent dollar in a high-rise. So, that\u2019s typically what we have seen in the high-rises as you do the work and then you don\u2019t need to do anything at all for quite a period of time. So, there is a little bit of an interplay there with expenses and capital.\nHaendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Thanks for that clarity. One more, I guess a follow-up on the Toll partnership and new Fort Worth project that you are starting here. Is that 5.5% yield you outlined, is that locked in, or can that be adjusted at yields or cap rates moved significantly? And then you mentioned that 75% of the costs are locked in there as well. What about the remaining 25%? Are you insulated from that, or how would that work?\nAlex Brackenridge: Yes. So, the 5.5% is just our projected yield. It\u2019s not locked in. We have \u2013 we are a partner with them. We have 75% of the equity. They have 25% and then the property will yield, what it yields and they will get their promotes relative to that. And then the second part of your question, what was that again? I am sorry.\nHaendel St. Juste: Locked in cost.\nAlex Brackenridge: Lockdown with the cost, yes. So, 75% is what we bought out. We have got the \u2013 Toll has bought out from their contractor. They also have a guarantee to us that they will be able to perform at that 100% number. So, it\u2019s just further surety that you have both the contractor and the developer had bought out 75%. Toll has a little bit more work to do to get it 100% bought out.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hi. I guess still morning out there. But thank you. I got two questions. Well, a very efficient call. You guys have gone through a lot of people. On the residents, last year, clearly, the city benefited big time as people flooded back in and took to renting apartments. Are you seeing that same phenomenon this year? So, meaning the ability for you guys to push rents, is that really driven by people continuing to flood into the markets, or are you seeing this year more normal that most of your demand is from within the market with some move in? I am just trying to get a sense of how the new resident profile has changed last year versus this year?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Alex, it\u2019s Mark. I am going to start and Michael is going to supplement, because he does have some good statistical stuff for you. As we kind of look at these markets, Seattle and San Francisco are less well recovered compared to New York and the East Coast markets. So, we still have that tailwind of people returning. And we have talked on some of these calls that if things and we do feel some improvement in the public safety situation in those two markets in the urban core, that is a possible tailwind for EQR towards the end of this year and going into next year, because there is relative value in Downtown Seattle and Downtown San Francisco on rents because they are still not really back. They are not \u2013 certainly, they are not evolved where they were when the pandemic occurred. And a lot of these suburban rents are crowding those rent levels, as we have said on calls. So, I will let Michael talk about where the people are coming from. But I think that red check being low on a relative basis still, it makes those markets attractive if public safety concerns continue to go away. So, I am sorry, Michael.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. No. So, I will just remind everybody, we do receive that time of application, a previous address for our new residents coming into the portfolio. So, this is where kind of these stats come from. And I will tell you, this quarter, we looked at the trends for the second quarter move in, and we continue to see slightly more new residents coming into our portfolio from outside of an MSA or even the state than normal. And to just give you some stats, so in a normal environment, and this would be like 2018, 2019, like historical data, we would typically see about 60% of our new residents come to us from within the same MSA and about 64% come from within the same state. Our move-ins during the second quarter 55% came from within the same MSA, so about 5% lower and 59% came from within the same state. So, both of these metrics were down about 500 basis points. And when we drilled in to any one of these areas to say where are they coming from, is it concentrated? Like is everybody coming to Seattle from San Francisco or anything like that, it was not concentrated at all, it was very fragmented. And for us, we view this as a very good positive indicator that our markets are continuing to draw this and attract this affluent renter from all over the United States and even slightly more kind of from the foreign countries because we saw that number tick up a little bit, too.\nAlexander Goldfarb: And you would say that was pretty \u2013 those stats are pretty uniform across all your markets? I mean obviously, you spoke Seattle and San Fran, but it\u2019s pretty uniform across all or biased.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I guess I would tell you when we went into like Southern Cal, like Orange County and San Diego, the inbound or the new residents there. It was more like in line and California typically has a really high percent that comes from within the same MSA in the same kind of state, very loyal to that state in MSA. That didn\u2019t have quite the same kind of shift as the whole portfolio, but it was pretty systemic across all the markets and even submarkets that we saw that trend.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, on the asset sale, you only quoted the IRR for the second quarter sales. I don\u2019t know what the IRR was on the July sale, but 6.6% unlevered IRR, how does that compare to your historic, I would have thought it would have been better just because of cap rate compression. And I think you guys have owned your New York asset a long time. You certainly bought the Macklowe assets that are really attractive cap rate. I guess I would have expected a better IRR, but maybe some perspective and then also your thoughts on the July 1?\nAlex Brackenridge: Yes. So, Alex, this is Alex. We have a couple of things that work there. One is it\u2019s a long time. We built those property \u2013 I am sorry, we bought those properties in 2005. So, you have got an IRR spread. Typically, IRRs go down over time just because they get diluted a little bit. So, there is that at work. It\u2019s also New York went through some challenging times since 2005. There was the GFC and the recovery from that. Then there was the pandemic. And then there were the changes to the rent stabilization laws that had an impact particularly on one\u2019s ability to convert a property in the condominiums, which was buttressing for a period of time, a lot of value in apartment buildings in New York. So, all of those things kind of combined to work against us. On top of which cap rates started out low in New York. So, there was less compression there. Because I think your question kind of implies there has been all this compression, why wouldn\u2019t you see more value growth, and in New York, we just didn\u2019t see that because it started so low and stayed low.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Pedro Cardoso with TCW.\nPedro Cardoso: Hi. Thanks for taking the call. Congratulation on the quarter. Just a quick one for me. I will be curious to know if you guys have been noticing any shift in tenant behavior, perhaps are they looking to shift to small units, or are they trying to find something a little bit more affordable. I will be curious to know if you re seeing any shifts in any way shape or form? I know that from a debt \u2013 from a rent income perspective, the portfolio is very healthy. But could you just know if you guys are noticing any shifts on those trends?\nMichael Manelis: Pedro, this is Michael. So first, just on the reasons for move-out, I said this a little bit earlier, we did see a slight uptick and just the increase was too expensive as one of the reasons that they are citing for move-outs that did occur. But again, we are running off of a base of an 11.1% turnover, which is the lowest that we have seen in the second quarter. When you just step back and just think about the overarching behaviors of the residents, I will bucket this into like a decoupling, like are we seeing any changes in unit type preference, are we seeing any changes in kind of the average adult per occupied home. And I would say, in our portfolio, we really haven\u2019t seen this material change. Pre-pandemic, we used to be at 1.65 adults per occupied home. Sitting here today, we are at 1.57. So, you can kind of see a slight decline in the average adult. And when you drill in \u2013 it\u2019s actually a little bit more prevalent in our one-bedroom household, which is about 48% or 50% kind of our portfolio versus anything that we saw like in the larger unit type. So, I think when you just step back and you think about macro trends in our industry, there is potential decoupling, whether it\u2019s explained by young adults making lifestyle decisions later, relative rent affordability that we saw during the pandemic, and now they are kind of moving on to something else or maybe starting to double up. We haven\u2019t seen that in our own or even just the rising wages, allowing single dose to live by themselves. All of that is contributing probably to this incremental demand and strength in pricing power. But specific to like our affluent renter in our portfolio, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have seen a significant shift in their behaviors.\nPedro Cardoso: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And one follow-up, if I may. And again, I understand that it\u2019s a very healthy rent to income portfolio for the New York portfolio around 18%. But I will be curious to know if there are \u2013 what are the extremes like, meaning how many tenants have rent income that are above 30%, that represents over the total tenant base that you have in New York?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I don\u2019t have that in front of me. I will tell you, across all of our markets, we have a range of 18 to 24 specific to New York. It is very, very few, if any, that bump up against that because our underwriting criteria against a gross rent would kind of prevent that from being anything of a significant level.\nPedro Cardoso: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nMichael Manelis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions. I would like to turn your conference back over to Mark Parrell for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark Parrell: Well, thank you, everyone, for your time today and enjoy the rest of the summer. Thank you again.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Let me start with a huge shout out to the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. They remain relentless in serving our customers and working together to deliver the strongest results in the history of our company. As expected, we had a very good second quarter. Resident turnover remains at all-time lows with strong demand driving robust pricing power and high physical occupancy at 96.7%. Pricing trend, which is the net effective price of our units inclusive of concessions, has grown almost 10% since the beginning of the year, which is well above the 6% range that it historically characterized a very good year. This pricing strength has contributed to an unprecedented new lease change with July expected to be about 16.5% and a significant loss to lease of 12.5%. July's moderation in the new lease change is less than we expected and is caused by a more challenging 2021 comparable period, not a loss in operating momentum as our sequential rents continue to grow. Our current position will contribute to continued above-average second half revenue growth and strong embedded growth for 2023. Our residents are well employed, and as Mark just mentioned, seeing their incomes rise. The unemployment rate for the college educated continues to be below 3%. And while we see the same headlines that you do about slowdowns in hiring or even layoffs, we are not seeing any impact on new leases or renewals. Our operating dashboards continue to flash green. Given the amount of hiring that the tech firms have done over the last few years, even with the moderation, they are still employing more people than they did pre-pandemic. The tenure of our residents has also improved to 2.3 years on average compared to 2.1 years last year and we are losing fewer and fewer residents to home purchase as single-family homeownership gets more and more challenging. In fact, in the second quarter, we had a 22% decrease compared to the second quarter of \u201821 in the number of residents who moved out to buy a home. We remain aware of the economic headwinds and we will position the portfolio more defensively if need be. But given the significant loss to lease, strong retention and healthy demand we are seeing, we remain optimistic. That said, as is true every year in our business, we expect rent growth to peak and then moderate seasonally in the summer, but we are happy to report that has not yet occurred. In sum, our operating metrics and forecast for the balance of the year remain beyond historical norms and Bob will provide more color on the building blocks of our revised guidance in his remarks. Let me take a minute and provide some color on market performance. In Boston, demand ramped up in both the urban and suburban submarkets driving a 90 base improvement in physical occupancy over the first quarter along with robust pricing power that came earlier in the season than usual. Rents have begun to moderate in this market. However, it is not uncommon to see modest reacceleration in August as students typically return then and are an important source of demand for our portfolio. We are definitely bullish on the second half performance, particularly in the suburban submarkets and remain cautiously optimistic on the city of Boston and Cambridge's ability to absorb some of the new units that are scheduled to be delivered later this year. The market continues to have strong employment with life sciences continuing to expand their footprint. New York continues with very healthy pricing power and demand. After significant impact from the pandemic, New York same-store revenue and NOI are now fully recovered back to 2019 levels. Physical occupancy is 97%. New lease change and renewal rate achieved were robust in the second quarter, with a vibrant environment continuing to attract our affluent renter demographic who is well employed and can afford to pay our rents. Despite these rental increases, our new residents are still paying us only approximately 18% of their income and our data indicates that our rents in this market have grown more slowly over the last 3 years of our new renters. The Washington, D.C. market continues to perform well, with physical occupancy at 96.7% and good growth in both new lease and renewals in the quarter. The absorption of new supply was good in the first half of the year, but we are keeping an eye on it as the year progresses. There are more than 12,500 units being delivered in 2022 with over 7,000 of them coming in the back half of the year from a competitive leasing standpoint. The absorption rate slowed a little bit in the second quarter, but still remains very strong and at current level, should support continued pricing power. While this market has historically shown high levels of supply, it is also one of the most resilient in the country during periods of uncertainty. The D.C. area unemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels and sits below the national average with good growth in the professional services and education health categories, where many of our residents are employed. Heading West, Denver has solid demand and good pricing power, stronger occupancy in the suburban portfolio and we expect some pressure from new supply in the downtown submarket. The Denver job market continues to enjoy healthy growth across a number of sectors, including the professional and business services. In Seattle, continued improvement on the quality-of-life issues is helping drive the comeback in the city, which now has rents that are just over pre-pandemic levels. Physical occupancy is above 96% and we continue to see strength in new lease rates and renewals. Concession use is isolated to the city and continues to moderate with approximately 20% of our applications receiving just under a month. This is down from over 50% from the first quarter and occupancy in the downtown submarket is now just over 96% as compared to 93% in March. Supply impact for us in 2022 is limited to our high-rise communities in the city, while 2023 shows less direct competition from new supply overall. This market continues to demonstrate high wage job creation. And while job postings from the major employers did moderate this quarter, the number of available positions is still near all-time record highs. The San Francisco market continues to improve with high occupancy supporting growth in both new lease and renewal rents. The issues around quality of life are improving, but Downtown San Francisco is still taking more time to return to pre-pandemic conditions than other markets across the country. Remember that the city was one of the last areas to ease COVID rules and just recently stepped up its focus on crime issues. While rents continue to be below pre-pandemic levels in the downtown submarket, they are working their way back. All of our other submarkets in San Francisco are at or above pre-pandemic pricing levels. Overall, I would say we are very optimistic on current trends in San Francisco, but have an eye on new supply that is expected to be delivered in the back half of the year and could erode pricing power if demand slows. Finally, Southern California continues to perform well, with physical occupancy at nearly 97% driving strong rental growth in both new lease and renewal rates. Specific to Los Angeles, the market is seeing elevated new supply as compared to the past several years, but the overall market remains undersupplied. Even in submarkets like Koreatown, where we expected pressure this year, the new supply is being quickly absorbed, leaving us better pricing power than we anticipated. On the delinquency front, we saw modest improvement in the second quarter in the payment behavior of our residents and continued rental relief receipts. As we look into the second half of the year, we don't expect rental relief receipts to be as material, which will lead to revenue growth moderation despite strong continued fundamentals. Before I turn it over to Bob, I just want to give a quick update on some of our innovation initiatives. Innovation is a major contributor to our ability to create operating efficiencies, while continuing to maintain a high level of customer service. Despite meaningful progress, we continue to have a lot of opportunity ahead of us as we integrate our initiatives, continue to leverage technology and advance our overall skill set. Just over half of our properties now operate without fully dedicated staff. We continued to invest in and implement software and processes that further enable the autonomous leasing experience, allowing customers to tour a community and interact with a member of our team or our AI leasing agent as much or as little as they desire. Self-guided tours continue to dominate as a preferred tour option, with just about 90% of all tours in the second quarter being self-guided. We are extremely excited about the future as we innovate to maximize revenue and minimize expense growth, while continuing to provide a great experience for our residents and employees. I will now turn the call over to Bob. Yes, hey, Nick, this is Michael. So I think right now, where we sit and I said this in the prepared remarks that the moderation that we saw in some of the stats in July is actually kind of much less than we expected and that's really just given kind of the speed of that concession burn-off and rate growth from last year. And when we started looking at the modeling for the back half of this year, we are kind of just assuming normal kind of seasonal trends. And we have data going all the way back to 2008 to benchmark this rent seasonality that includes like the exact week when rents peaked each week, each year. And when we went back and looked and I said this in the prepared remarks, our rents have not peaked yet. And you see it over the time where you have had years where rents peaked in early July, all the way until like the very first week of September, but the most common kind of peak week has been somewhere in that first or second week of August. So as we were modeling kind of we just assume we are going to have rents peak somewhere in this first or second week of August and then have a normal kind of trail off in rents until you get to that January period. Yes. This is Michael. Maybe I'll start, and Mark, you can kind of add on, if you'd like. But I think what you should expect is somewhere on our October earnings call, we will probably provide a little bit more of a range of the building blocks into 2023, that would include the earn-in. And by earn-in, for me, I use the term embedded and what that would mean is on 12/31 of this year, you would freeze the rent roll and assume that nobody moved in, nobody moves out and what does that revenue growth look like? I would tell you that in normal years, we would start January one-off with an embedded growth somewhere around 1% in the rent roll. And even with the forecasted moderation, it is pretty clear that our expected embedded growth is going to be well above kind of that average amount. So I guess I would point to the longer we go without having rents peak, right? It's just adding more growth to this embedded as every new lease and renewal gets written here in August, September and even October. And as you think about turning the corner, just factor in moderation and then your views for what intra-period growth could look like in 2023, and that's how we will be kind of doing the building blocks for our guidance for next year. But we're not at a point yet where we're willing to share those numbers because we still have a lot of transactions to write. Yes. So Steve, this is Michael. I'll just start and talk a little bit about the renewals. So yes, we definitely have kind of renewal quotes put out into the marketplace through the end of September and even into October. I said in the prepared remarks, we have a lot of confidence in this renewal process that we put in place. So right now, the quotes that have gone out in July and August, on a net effective basis, we're right around 12%. And we're negotiating somewhere right under that 200 basis point kind of spread. So we expect to achieve around 10%. I think that's a fairly good number to think about for the next several months. And even as you think about the balance of the year, you will see some moderation in that achieved renewal increase rate, but it's not going to be this material drop off. It's going to stay somewhere in that high single digit and maybe even to this low kind of double-digit range. But I think as we think about our process right now, we've centralized all of the renewal negotiations, which has really kind of helped facilitating these renewal conversations and giving us a lot of confidence as we put out these quotes to really be able to project kind of what to expect from them. Yes. So I would say, look, our record low turnover, we had 11.1% reported tax turnover in the second quarter, which is the lowest turnover we've reported for a second quarter in the history. You are starting to see and we even said this, acknowledge this a little bit in June through some of the conversations we had. You are starting to see a little bit of price resistance from some folks that came in with the deal early on in this recovery, they were renewing at the exact same pace. And by deal seekers, I mean people that came in that received concessions, really discounted rent. What we saw right now when we looked at the move-out behaviors in the second quarter, we saw a slight uptick in people citing that the increase was too expensive, and that was the reason they were moving out. And I think specific into New York, we definitely saw some folks from Manhattan kind of give us that notice and then move over into kind of that Jersey City area and taking advantage of some of the rent arbitrage there, just at that lower price point. But overall, I would say the renewal percent, the percent of residents renewing remains really strong. We're either at or right above like these historical averages for this time of the year. And we really just haven't seen us bumping up against this kind of affordability question that's been out there. And the rent as a percent of income in our portfolio remains very constant which means that the income for our residents is definitely keeping pace kind of with the rent increases that we're seeing across the markets. Yes. So well, I think we're always pushing the renewal front because we're quoting kind of where street rents are and then we're having these dialogues and pretty much holding the line. When somebody does move out, so if you don't renew that resident, you are absorbing vacancy loss. So that definitely starts to come into some of that equation. If you just step back and think about the occupancy of this portfolio, I mean, when demand is strong and the front door is strong, you have a lot more confidence to hold the line into kind of this renewal process because if that resident does move out, you're able to fill them very quickly at these high rates. So for us, if the demand picture stays as strong as it is, I would expect our portfolio is going to maintain strong occupancy. I think we should allow occupancy to probably trail off a little bit into that fourth quarter, but I think it is going to remain relatively strong. So when we look at the difference between new lease and renewal, I mean, we want to retain our residents, we want to retain our residents at a fair price. If the front door is not as strong, you will see us start to negotiate more into that renewal process. But if the demand stays as strong as it is, you're going to see us kind of hold the line with these renewals. Yes. Well, this is Michael. I think it's really a function of where our market rents. So what happens to intra-period rent growth next year is really going to dictate a lot around where these quotes go out. But I think Mark mentioned earlier on the call, when you think about some of these regulations that we've been bumping up against this year, those regulations are actually going to help fuel renewal growth next year because it's clear we're going to be able to be quoting increases beyond what intra-period rent growth is just to catch up to the market through that. So in our modeling, yes, you're going to have a little bit of this tail off in this achieved renewal increase because you have to assume that market rent prices seasonally do decline. They have declined every single year since 2008. At some point, you hit a peak and then you have some sense of moderation through 12/31 of the year, and then you start the cycle all over again. So that moderation is going to yield some softness in the quotes that go out the door. But again, it's very marginal. It's still going to be very high single digit of this low kind of double-digit. And then as we get into this October call, we will kind of give you our view as to how we think this is going to play out into 2023. But again, we got a little bit of a boost coming to us from just being able to catch up from all the regulation restrictions that we're faced with today. Yes. I mean this is Michael. I think you are hitting on a couple of points. So, even when you look at the data and you see some of that rate growth deceleration that occurred like on the renewal quote. A lot of this is just a function of that comp period from last year. And just to remind everybody, last year, when we hit July, that was the first time that our new lease change went positive. June of \u201821, we were negative 50 basis points, July of \u201821, new lease change went to positive 6.9%. So, a huge 740 basis point improvement in one month in just that new lease change. And then from that point forward, it's sequentially approved every single month that new lease change and then fuel blended. So, as we think about where we sit today, you have to, like I said before, we have to allow for rents to moderate. The price in the market will moderate between now and the end of the year. In a normal year, I would say it's somewhere in that 3% to 3.5% range is where kind of the market rents after you peak whichever week you peak at, you will allow some moderation to the end of the year in the tune of about 3.5%. But then when you look at where we are at with the changes that we were seeing last year sequentially, that is what's going to fuel this moderation in our blended rate that we will be putting up in the third quarter and fourth quarter. But all that being said, where we land after the moderation, where we land after these tough comps is still significantly above historical norms. Yes. Well, this is Michael. I think from the operating efficiencies when we think about payroll benefits, I would say we are probably getting closer to the middle innings of our runway. And I said before, like when we talked about kind of we think we have identified $25 million to $30 million that's going to roll in over the course of 2023 and 2024 front half-loaded with kind of more of the expense opportunities and then it kicks into the initiatives focused on enhancing revenue. So, I look at the expense stuff and I would say we are probably in the middle of the innings there, but we are in the very early stages of the benefits from the revenue lifts on many of the initiatives that we are focused on. Yes. So, this is Michael. Let me clarify. So, the numbers that I was quoting before is the achieved renewal rate off of the offers that we put out there, where we believe that is going to be around this 10% for the next several months. And when we think about kind of the midpoint of our guidance, Bob pointed to this earlier, we are allowing some moderation in the new lease change and we are factoring in fairly consistent achieved renewal rate increases based on what we can see with a little bit of moderation in the fourth quarter just based on kind of normal seasonal decline in rate. It's not that simple, but I will correct you. I think I did say it's going to be well above average. Well above that... Maybe that's a little more helpful. Yes. Look, again, I said this earlier. We are still writing a lot of leases, right. You still got a lot of activity coming through the rent roll. I think it's clear that we have got the right setup in place for a really strong year next year based on the fundamentals of loss to lease, looking at where this embedded growth is today, looking at the strength in the market, knowing that rents haven't peaked out yet. So, I think you just got to hold off and give us until October, and we will give you a little bit more clarity into the ranges of these building blocks, but I don't think it's as pure as like there is a direct one-to-one relationship between blended rate and kind of where that embedded growth is on 12/31. Yes. So Haendel, this is Michael. I guess I would just start \u2013 I think I just went through a little bit of this as to where we are, which is from the efficiency standpoint on the operating platform. I would say that we are probably getting close to the middle innings, midway through. We have got a lot of the base technology installed. We are still working through some of kind of the smart home technology or access into units that we will add to some more efficiencies. You got half the portfolio running today without fully dedicated teams there. So, we have still got a little bit of opportunity kind of left to layer in the technology and create more efficiencies in the property management side. But for us, we are more excited right now because we are still in the early stages of the lift that we see from layering in technology into the income side of our business, the revenue growth engine, and we are in the very early innings of that of laying out all of these initiatives. And that benefit really comes in, in late \u201823 and into \u201824. But I think what you will see is you are going to see us continue to kind of mitigate some of the inflationary pressures on OpEx by just continuing what we have laid out in course of leveraging technology to create the operating efficiencies that will mitigate some of the expense pressures in 2023. And then you will see the engine kick in and switch more to the revenue lift. Yes. I mean I guess I would look into some of the high-rise portfolios and say, you typically would have more staffing there. You have concierge, you have more labor pressure. You clearly have more dependency on some contractors relative to elevators and things like that. So, I guess I haven't looked at the number, but I would be surprised if we don't see a little bit more growth in the high-rise portfolio than we did in the suburban garden style. Yes. No. So, I will just remind everybody, we do receive that time of application, a previous address for our new residents coming into the portfolio. So, this is where kind of these stats come from. And I will tell you, this quarter, we looked at the trends for the second quarter move in, and we continue to see slightly more new residents coming into our portfolio from outside of an MSA or even the state than normal. And to just give you some stats, so in a normal environment, and this would be like 2018, 2019, like historical data, we would typically see about 60% of our new residents come to us from within the same MSA and about 64% come from within the same state. Our move-ins during the second quarter 55% came from within the same MSA, so about 5% lower and 59% came from within the same state. So, both of these metrics were down about 500 basis points. And when we drilled in to any one of these areas to say where are they coming from, is it concentrated? Like is everybody coming to Seattle from San Francisco or anything like that, it was not concentrated at all, it was very fragmented. And for us, we view this as a very good positive indicator that our markets are continuing to draw this and attract this affluent renter from all over the United States and even slightly more kind of from the foreign countries because we saw that number tick up a little bit, too. Yes. I guess I would tell you when we went into like Southern Cal, like Orange County and San Diego, the inbound or the new residents there. It was more like in line and California typically has a really high percent that comes from within the same MSA in the same kind of state, very loyal to that state in MSA. That didn't have quite the same kind of shift as the whole portfolio, but it was pretty systemic across all the markets and even submarkets that we saw that trend. Pedro, this is Michael. So first, just on the reasons for move-out, I said this a little bit earlier, we did see a slight uptick and just the increase was too expensive as one of the reasons that they are citing for move-outs that did occur. But again, we are running off of a base of an 11.1% turnover, which is the lowest that we have seen in the second quarter. When you just step back and just think about the overarching behaviors of the residents, I will bucket this into like a decoupling, like are we seeing any changes in unit type preference, are we seeing any changes in kind of the average adult per occupied home. And I would say, in our portfolio, we really haven't seen this material change. Pre-pandemic, we used to be at 1.65 adults per occupied home. Sitting here today, we are at 1.57. So, you can kind of see a slight decline in the average adult. And when you drill in \u2013 it's actually a little bit more prevalent in our one-bedroom household, which is about 48% or 50% kind of our portfolio versus anything that we saw like in the larger unit type. So, I think when you just step back and you think about macro trends in our industry, there is potential decoupling, whether it's explained by young adults making lifestyle decisions later, relative rent affordability that we saw during the pandemic, and now they are kind of moving on to something else or maybe starting to double up. We haven't seen that in our own or even just the rising wages, allowing single dose to live by themselves. All of that is contributing probably to this incremental demand and strength in pricing power. But specific to like our affluent renter in our portfolio, I wouldn't say that we have seen a significant shift in their behaviors. Yes. I don't have that in front of me. I will tell you, across all of our markets, we have a range of 18 to 24 specific to New York. It is very, very few, if any, that bump up against that because our underwriting criteria against a gross rent would kind of prevent that from being anything of a significant level. Thank you."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. In a minute, Michael will walk you through a performance update by market, then Bob will discuss our guidance improvements, update you on how our innovation machine continues to hold expense growth down in an increasingly inflationary world, and then Bob will close with some color on our balance sheet and then we will take your questions. Equity Residential had a tremendous quarter. Our business continues to benefit from terrific supply and demand dynamics, including excellent job growth and household formation. Our urban and dense suburban portfolio continues to be a magnet for our affluent renter demographic as demonstrated by our 96.7% same-store physical occupancy. We also believe that the desire for more space due to work from home and COVID-related health concerns has resulted in significant incremental household formation, creating additional demand for our properties. Also, housing alternatives remain expensive and in low supply. Single-family home prices reached record levels in 2022 while rising mortgage rates have further stressed affordability, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Single-family housing starts are declining. Existing homeowners are more reluctant to sell due to low locked in mortgage rates, along with minimal and expensive for sale replacement options and competition for homes from investors remain strong. The near-term apartment supply picture also remains favorable. Starts within close proximity to our properties in our coastal markets are still at or below pre-pandemic levels. In addition, it seems likely to us that over the next few quarters, new apartment starts should decline due to reduced availability and higher pricing of construction financing, increasing construction costs and continued supply chain disruptions, lengthening construction times and increasing developer risk. Recently elevated inflation numbers are certainly a concern, especially if efforts to rein in inflation lead to much weaker job growth. On the positive side, our affluent renter base should be able to better weather rising inflation in part due to lower relative rent-to-income ratios and higher amounts of disposable income. As in the past, if inflation does persist, we would expect the apartment business to perform relatively well. As we look at our resident income, the average incomes for our residents who sign new leases with us in the last 12 months is 13% higher than the group who signed with us in the 12 months ended June 2021. These new residents are paying us approximately 19.8% of their incomes versus 19.2% last year in rent. They are not rent stressed and they are willing to pay these rents to live in locations that support the lifestyles they seek to enjoy. On the larger topic of affordability, we see a continued need for more workforce housing and continue to support market-based affordable housing supply solutions, including zoning reform, public-private partnerships and other programs that assist in affordable housing preservation and creation. As part of this support and in addition to the more than 2,600 apartment units that we already operate in affordable programs, we have funded about half of our $5 million commitment to a privately held affordable housing preservation fund that expects to preserve approximately 1,600 affordable housing units when it's fully deployed. Now, switching gears to the investment side of our business, we saw a material slowdown in the transactions market during the quarter. Higher interest rates, especially for the floating rate debt used by many value-add buyers as well as general uncertainty about the path of the economy and evaluations led most buyers to pause. We did recently close on the sale of 2 properties in New York, 1 property for $266 million at a 3.3% disposition yield in the second quarter, and another New York property for $415 million at a 3.4% disposition yield this month. The properties are adjacent to each other on the Upper West side. Both properties represent pricing contracted for before the recent volatility in the apartment transaction market and our continuation of our stated strategy of lowering our New York market exposure. As we have said before, we will continue to have a meaningful exposure to the New York area, but intend to better balance our urban versus suburban exposure in our established markets like New York, while adding over time to our exposure to our expansion markets, which are attracting increasing numbers of affluent renters and have lower regulatory risks. For our part, we are very comfortable letting the transaction market sort itself out and have reset our transaction guidance so it reflects only buys and sales completed to-date plus one smaller disposition that is under a long-term contract that should close in the fourth quarter. While apartment values are not immune from the more general revaluation of risk assets going on across all asset classes, we expect apartment assets to remain in high demand from institutional buyers and for rising NOIs to partially cushion increases in cap rates. We have the balance sheet and the team ready to take advantage of any opportunities we do see as we have done in the past. Moving on to development, we started two new developments in the quarter. The first project is $153 million densification of an existing property we own in Santa Clara, California, about 1.5 miles from Apple's headquarters. We will be demolishing 40 units in buildings built in 1972 in a highly desirable area, with little supply of high-quality rental housing and replacing them with 225 new units plus significant amenities that will benefit the remaining 224 units at the property that are undergoing renovation. We are very excited about this project and expect a 6% development yield when it stabilizes. At a cost per unit of about $675,000, we also like our basis as compared to recent sales comps. We are also pleased to have started this quarter, our first development project with Toll Brothers. This $82 million, 362-unit project is being built just west of downtown Fort Worth, Texas in a rapidly gentrifying area with good access to job centers and to the increasing number of nearby lifestyle amenities like restaurants, bars and entertainment venues that are appealing to young well-off renters. We expect to build this property for about $225,000 per unit. We like our expected basis and we love working with a high-quality, financially strong developer like Toll that has the experience to capably manage construction and a climate with significant inflationary cost pressures. That said, this deal is approximately 75% bought out, reducing our risk. On current rents and costs, this deal has approximately a 5.5% development yield. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael. And just to supplement that for just a second is just talking a little bit about replacement cost. I mean, that's a big differentiator. It's a mark between the coastal markets where the premium to replacement cost and a lot of assets were sold at was not significant or even in places like New York, there was little bit of a discount. And in some of the Sunbelt markets where there was a pretty significant premium to replacement cost and you saw us really slow down our activities when we \u2013 acquisition activities, when we saw some of those premiums go up into the 20%, 25% and up range over current construction costs. So, I guess one of the things, Alex and I am going to be looking at as we think about starting to buy machine up again is those markets \u2013 those Sunbelt markets start to make more sense on a replacement cost basis. That maybe because construction costs keep going up, that maybe because values come down a little bit but that is another input that's important. And it was one of the things that made us go a lot slower towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year, Nick. And you asked \u2013 it's Mark, this time, Chandni. You asked a very good question of let's say the economy does fall down a bit more and we do have a more \u2013 we actually have a set recession and how do we feel? Well, certainly, that would affect our numbers negatively. I mean job growth and economic growth are vital to the apartment industry's success over the long haul. But the supply demand environment for us is very favorable right now. And so the fact that single family is pretty pricey, the fact that, that means to us that our older millennial demographics going to stay with us longer, and you see that in our retention numbers. This Gen-Z group that's pretty large that's coming through the system where there just aren't enough jobs even right now. So if there is a few fewer because a lot of what we've seen about the job market isn't that there is so many fewer jobs and people are unemployed. It's more that the excess is being taken out of the system. So I guess our sense is the supply demand balance is pretty good for us, and it will likely be pretty good unless a recession \u2013 if a recession occurs, is very severe. So the setup for \u201823, it just really is quite excellent, even if there is a recession. It just won't be as excellent, but on a relative basis, it will still feel, I think the revenue growth for us and for most of the industry really, really good. Yes, it's Mark again. Development is one of the tools in the toolkit. I mean one of the things that's happening now that makes us happy not to have too large a development pipeline is if values do go down a bit here, Chandni, and there is portfolios for sale, and there is a discount available to us, you'll see us be very active and very aggressive in going out and grabbing those deals. So I think you're going to see it be pretty quiet for a few months here. My guess is that buyers and sellers will decide that this is the new market. And towards the end of the year, we might get considerably more active. We will continue to do development. We like a lot of the deals. We've got a couple more we're likely to start this year. But I guess what I'm most excited about is to see some of these acquisitions come in at a little bit more reasonable price, to be able for us to act on that and act in volume on that. So again, to us, it seems like it's going to be quiet kind of through Labor Day for sure, and then it might pick up a bit. Alex, what would you \u2013 I don't have a deadline for completing the transformation of the portfolio. I mean we will be reactive to the market opportunity. Do you have any... Thank you. And Steve, before Bob just gives you a little more elaboration on blended spreads and such, One of the things that's, I think, really interesting here on renewals is because in a fair number of jurisdictions, mostly in California, we can't raise rents to market that we're limited up to some jurisdictional limits, you're going to have some energy even if rents do decline a bit as they will seasonally and as they may due to the economy, I think renewals will be another positive in \u201823 because we're going to have markets where we continue to be significantly. In some cases, even 20% below the market even after an increase. And so if that 20% becomes 15%, it's still a pretty good size increase. So I think the fact that we haven't been able to meet the market on renewals probably leaves a little bit of gas in the tank in \u201823 too even if rents do moderate for both \u2013 and they will for seasonal reasons, but for economic reasons, I'm sorry, Bob. Hey, Brad, it's Mark. So we certainly have the capability to buy the stock back, and we get that. As we've talked about on these calls in the past, it's a bit of a different thing for REITs than it is for most corporates because we don't retain earnings. So to do a real buyback, again, it requires you to sell a bunch of assets, which we did do or incur a bunch of debt. And from our perspective, paying off the debt helped us address the \u201823 maturities. It gave us optionality to buy the stock back later. We used up really all of our capability. So we have a little bit of a flex each year in our ability to sell assets and retain cash. And we really used all of that up with these two sales. So we thought, you know what, we will pay down this debt, we will retain this capability. If the Board decides it wants to buy some stock back later, we will have that opportunity. But those opportunities are just so few and for REITs, you start to descale the enterprise. It's just not as easy a decision as it is for, say, a big technology company with tons of retained earnings. And we got a big $900 million-plus dividend. And that's really where we think the cash return to the shareholder is. A lot of these other folks that talk about buybacks more readily are corporates that don't have dividends and do a lot more buyback activity as a matter, of course. So we did consider it, it's an option by paying some debt off, we retain that option. Yes. Hey, it's Mark. I'm going to start, and I think some of us might \u2013 some of the others might supplement because we've been thinking a lot about this over time. So we went back and looked at periods of time when there was more significant inflation. So again, this will be more like the \u201880s and parts of the \u201870s and even into the \u201890s. And I guess I'd say our ability to reset rents every year, the pretty good supply-demand dynamic, in fact, very good we have currently. I don't have a number for you. I would have normally said that normal trend growth for EQR on the revenue line is 3.5%. And I would tell you that with inflation the way it is, the numbers are likely to be a fair bit higher because supply and demand are still also good. We could have a ton of inflation. If you have a ton of supply in a submarket, you're still not moving your rents. But we've got good demand, single-family sectors, not drawing residents away. So the way we're feeling about it is that we're going to be able to provide a pretty good margin to whatever the inflation numbers are especially as we expect them to sort of settle down. There is also this little bit of a circular reference thing where rent is something like third of the CPI. So we feed into that number, and that number feeds into our number. And so there is a little bit of that as well. But I think you should expect that apartments, especially our portfolio, are optimized in a way with our pricing engine that we can continue to have a real return that exceeds the rate of inflation. So if you think inflation is 5, then I think our growth is going to be a margin to that number, above it. I think the other part of that question or that answer, though, is what are you doing with your expenses, because we do feel the pressure on wages and other things. And that's why we had both Michael and Bob address that issue with you because we need to keep our margins constant or growing and not just give it all the way on the expense side, and I think we're doing an exceptionally good job of that. Yes. Just \u2013 and Bob will correct my specific numbers here, but I think we got in the back half of last year, $34 million or so in the same-store set in rental relief. And our modeling is something like $2 million for the back half of this year. So when we talked in our prepared remarks about how we see the strength continuing, what obscures some of these numbers is just these pretty significant rent recoveries from the government that tend to be kind of lumpy. So to see in the back half of the year, a negative impact year-over-year on all this bad debt stuff but you're going to see the continued strength, we think, in the underlying occupancy business. rate, all of that stuff, occupancy is staying high, that's going to offset that and keep those numbers pretty consistent, Nick, going forward. And just to add, we are buying in suburbs of places like Dallas too. It isn't mostly or even close to mostly in all urban portfolio. We are trying to construct in Atlanta or Austin or Dallas or Denver. So, we are spreading our capital out. And that's where development can be really handy is in some of these suburban locations where it might be hard to find a property to buy. Not that simple. Then scratch the quarter. Yes, it's Mark. Thanks for that \u2013 that's a very insightful question. We thought a fair bit about it. We wondered if it isn't similar to buying something you do as a lifestyle decision. I mean people mostly buy homes, not for financial reasons, but lifestyle. They have the second kid, they got married or had some other life change that requires them or makes them feel like, we will do the commute, we will do what we need to do to have the lifestyle we now need to have with the family situation we now have. I think that single-family rental does feels the same way that people will be similarly attracted to it, not because they have died them all along, but because they are really at a point where they have two kids and they are living in an urban environment, and that's just more challenging for them or whatnot. So, I think about SFR as more of an additional competitor for sure, but having the same drivers as just purchasing a home. In terms of other competitive threats, we have definitely benefited from people wanting more space and decoupling. We do see that people will accept roommates and live in other situations. So, just switching to another thing that could be a demand negative for us, it's possible that it will go the other direction. I mean it is certainly something rich that could happen where folks decide they will take on the roommate. They are not as afraid to the pandemic, and they will do that. We are not seeing any of that, but that would be another way you could see demand decline. But I don't \u2013 these SFR homes are mostly, it seems to us a replacement for single-family owned housing, not a new \u2013 like an entirely new source of competition. Yes. That's a really interesting question. I mean we had a version of this conversation, if I remember a couple of quarters ago. But it's part of our job. And your question implies it to be looking at every subsector in the residential space. I think single-family rental has certainly established itself as a very legitimate long-term business. A lot of our former executives worked in that space. We do pay attention to that space. It's very interesting in that regard. Our primary focus right now is running this big apartment business we have. But we will keep our eyes open. And I guess if something wanders buy, we will act on it. But again, we are getting a lot of benefit right now and people moving into these cities again, and we are focused mostly on that at this point. Thanks Rich. And Juste, its Mark. To add to that good question you have there. I mean the CapEx load, for example, and I know you referred to expenses, but the CapEx load is spread on a high-rise usually at much higher rent than the Garden one. So, you might be doing things with chillers and you might be doing things, but there is one roof, not a multitude of roofs. There is no landscaping. So, putting aside real estate taxes, margins I would think the labor only margin would not be as good in a high-rise because of usually higher service standards. But I bet just some of the CapEx with the higher rents is a lower percentage of each rent dollar in a high-rise. So, that's typically what we have seen in the high-rises as you do the work and then you don't need to do anything at all for quite a period of time. So, there is a little bit of an interplay there with expenses and capital. Yes. Alex, it's Mark. I am going to start and Michael is going to supplement, because he does have some good statistical stuff for you. As we kind of look at these markets, Seattle and San Francisco are less well recovered compared to New York and the East Coast markets. So, we still have that tailwind of people returning. And we have talked on some of these calls that if things and we do feel some improvement in the public safety situation in those two markets in the urban core, that is a possible tailwind for EQR towards the end of this year and going into next year, because there is relative value in Downtown Seattle and Downtown San Francisco on rents because they are still not really back. They are not \u2013 certainly, they are not evolved where they were when the pandemic occurred. And a lot of these suburban rents are crowding those rent levels, as we have said on calls. So, I will let Michael talk about where the people are coming from. But I think that red check being low on a relative basis still, it makes those markets attractive if public safety concerns continue to go away. So, I am sorry, Michael. Well, thank you, everyone, for your time today and enjoy the rest of the summer. Thank you again."

            "name": "Alex Brackenridge",
            "content": "Hey, Nick, this is Alex. Well, as you know, the market is certainly unsettled right now and there is a lot of a feeling out process going on. So, there have been some transactions that closed. Some of those though were hard prior to the rate hikes, some of those maybe a buyer had 1031 needs. So, it's a little hard to get great clarity on that question. But clearly there is these countervailing forces that you mentioned interest rates up, economic uncertainty offset by just these tremendous property operations. So, I would say somewhere 5% to 8%, maybe up to 10%, where we are certainly seeing buyers scrutinizing things that might have a little bit of hair on them, maybe a lesser location, maybe a physical challenge that they might have overlooked before. So the range could get higher, but we also don't see a lot of distressed sellers, which lot of people are happy to keep enjoying the great performance that their properties are generating. So, it's a bit of a range, but we will see how it plays out, particularly come fall. It's a little slow in the summer as it typically has been. I would just add that in environments like this, we have a competitive advantage over some higher leverage buyers. So it's been very competitive. Everyone's bid was more or less the same in the last couple of years, now the ability to transact very quickly. We have our own management company, our due diligence is very fast, and we're all cash. So \u2013 and we have great relationships. And that's the thing we're doing right now is maintaining our relationships with our brokers and with principles. And when the time is right, we will move quickly and the machine will get ramped up again. Yes. As I said, it's a little bit tough to know because it's pretty unsure footing right now. That is an answer we're looking for. On our end, we look a lot about what we can sell properties for. So we have some transactions in the market that we're considering, and we will see how pricing comes out on that, and that dictates it a lot. But clearly, it's higher than it was. I don't know if I have an exact number on that. Yes. John, it's Alex. As I said, it varies a lot and well-located, clean properties. I think it's closer to the 5-ish on something that's more complicated maybe as a physical issue, maybe got a lot of vacant retail. It's going to be higher than that. But that's the number people are feeling each other out and they really don't know. And I think it's a time just to be patient, which is what we're doing and most sellers \u2013 most sellers and buyers are doing that right now. So there is some assets that have just been pulled off a market because there is not a lot of traction, but there is a whole bunch of money on the sidelines, as you know, and there is a lot of people that are, frankly, right now hiring up because they expect to buy more apartments in the future. So I think that this will settle itself out but there is a range right now to answer your question of pricing variance between the buyer and seller expectations. Yes, there is a range. I mean, certainly, New York is the poster child for lower supply. But there are other markets, too, like Orange County and San Diego that are seeing a drop off in supply. Markets that have continued high supply include Washington, D.C., Denver has a lot of supply, Austin and Dallas and more moderate are Atlanta, Seattle and Boston. So it varies a lot across the market. And overall, it's pretty steady. Looking at 2024 though, it gets \u2013 \u201824, \u201825, it gets more complicated and harder to project. And we see a lot of permits that have been pulled. But we've looked historically, and when times get a little uncertain like this. There is a big drop off. I mean, historically, permits translate into starts like 80% to 80%, 80%, 90%. But when times get tough, that drops to 40% to 50%. So that's what might happen over time here as the \u201824, \u201825 deliveries decrease. Yes. No, it doesn't feel super optimistic. There was a proposal that got rejected. So at this point, there is some discussions, but nothing imminent. Hey John, it's Alex. In terms of pricing moderating, so that's making acquisitions look relatively more attractive. If that continues, construction costs go up, then we would lean more towards acquisitions, but we are also focused on development, too, as an important component of fleshing out the portfolio. So, I would expect we would do a little bit of both depending on the circumstances. Yes. So, the 5.5% is just our projected yield. It's not locked in. We have \u2013 we are a partner with them. We have 75% of the equity. They have 25% and then the property will yield, what it yields and they will get their promotes relative to that. And then the second part of your question, what was that again? I am sorry. Lockdown with the cost, yes. So, 75% is what we bought out. We have got the \u2013 Toll has bought out from their contractor. They also have a guarantee to us that they will be able to perform at that 100% number. So, it's just further surety that you have both the contractor and the developer had bought out 75%. Toll has a little bit more work to do to get it 100% bought out. Yes. So, Alex, this is Alex. We have a couple of things that work there. One is it's a long time. We built those property \u2013 I am sorry, we bought those properties in 2005. So, you have got an IRR spread. Typically, IRRs go down over time just because they get diluted a little bit. So, there is that at work. It's also New York went through some challenging times since 2005. There was the GFC and the recovery from that. Then there was the pandemic. And then there were the changes to the rent stabilization laws that had an impact particularly on one's ability to convert a property in the condominiums, which was buttressing for a period of time, a lot of value in apartment buildings in New York. So, all of those things kind of combined to work against us. On top of which cap rates started out low in New York. So, there was less compression there. Because I think your question kind of implies there has been all this compression, why wouldn't you see more value growth, and in New York, we just didn't see that because it started so low and stayed low."

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. A quick comment on the quarter before moving to guidance on the balance sheet. Q2 normalized FFO was $0.03 above the high-end of our quarterly guidance range. This beat was almost entirely driven by better same-store NOI through a combination of better revenue growth, including lower bad debt expense and modest overall expense growth. Now, for our revisions to full year guidance, as you saw in the release last night, we significantly revised same-store revenue and normalized FFO upwards while maintaining our existing same-store expense growth guidance. Starting with same-store revenue, strong first half performance, coupled with the constructive ongoing operating environment has led us to raise our same-store revenue projections above the top end of the prior range. We now expect our same-store revenue to grow between 10% and 11%. Our new 10.5% midpoint sits at 150 basis points higher than the prior midpoint driven by continued stable physical occupancy of 96.5%, record resident retention and earlier as well as stronger pricing power, both the new lease change and renewal rate achieved across all of our markets, but particularly in New York, where recovery from the pandemic has been a positive to the upside. Our revised full year same-store revenue guidance implies a slight deceleration in same-store revenue growth in the back half of 2022. This is the result of the significant governmental rental relief payments we received in Q3 and Q4 of 2021 and the almost complete absence of relief payments we expect to receive from the rest of this year, not any expectation of a slowdown in the core business. We expect third and fourth quarter same-store quarter-over-quarter revenues without the impact of rental relief payments to be more in line with the reported Q2 number. On the expense side, we left our already strong guidance unchanged with June year-to-date expense growth of 2.8% and a number of innovation initiatives underway, we feel confident in our ability to deliver second low expense growth for the full year. As you can see in our reported results, both real estate tax growth and payroll are aiding in our ability to accomplish this goal with some offset in utilities and repairs and maintenance. We remain laser-focused on reducing or eliminating exposure to inflationary labor pressures, whether we feel the impact from our own employees through the payroll line item or from contractors through the repairs and maintenance line. We strive to reduce any pressure from higher efficiency and better decision-making along with utilization of technology that can eliminate or permanently reduce labor hours needed. In a category like utilities, we do our best to maximize our resident reimbursement income, reduce usage through both education and technology initiatives and hedge our commodity exposure. Thus far, our approach has significantly buffered growth, but we acknowledge this is a long game if the current inflationary environment continues. Putting it altogether, the revenue and expense adjustments that I just outlined resulted in a 225 basis point increase for same-store NOI at the midpoint. For normalized FFO at the midpoint our guidance changes added nearly 3% or $30 million to normalized FFO growth, which results in an approximately 18% increase year-over-year for the company. A final note on the balance sheet before Q&A. Equity Residential continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector, characterized by low floating rate exposure and a long weighted average maturity. Subsequent to quarter end, we sent a notice to redeem the $500 million secured unsecured notes that are due in 2023 with proceeds from the dispositions of the two New York properties. This use of proceeds will mostly offset the normalized FFO impact of net dispositions for the year while also significantly reducing our refinancing needs in 2023. There is no prepayment penalty associated with the payoff, but there will be a modest write-off of historical discounts and costs, which is estimated on the guidance page. This write-off will be included in EPS and FFO, but not in normalized FFO. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Yes. So I think Mark and Michael kind of gave you the blended perspective, which is in our guidance, so maintaining that kind of high single-digit renewal component. So they gave you the renewal piece, and I'll give you the blended, which really is the new lease. So we talked about the seasonality and the trend of seasonality in rents, coupled with that just hard comparable period in the back half of 2021 and that's going to lead your new lease and as a result, correspondingly, you're blended to moderate as you get into the back half of the year, which is what we're including in our guidance. That's very normal. I think the only abnormal thing here is what we've modeled is something that remains positive on the new lease side. In a normal year, kind of pre-pandemic, new lease change often would go negative in the fourth quarter, and that's not what we're incorporating in our guidance. Yes. To be honest with you, it's less about appeals in 2022 than it probably has been historically and more about just lower assessed values we came into the year, particularly in a place like Washington state, where we had lower assessed values and where rate wasn't particularly high either on the real estate tax side. So that's really been the driver of keeping it more modest. The real estate tax market is typically a laggard. So it usually delayed relative to like market values in other places. So that's what you're seeing play out in 2022. As we look forward into 2023 and not giving guidance, we're just setting the tone for the environment, I think it will become more about appeals because I think the recovery and what's happening in the broader kind of valuation and market is more apparent. And so I think it will be more what I call hand-to-hand combat with the assessors of you think that value is X, I think value is Y and let's appeal. So I think that's going to change the dynamic in 2023 and going forward. Yes. So I'll start with the last part first and then highlight a couple of things about the quarter. So from a year-over-year standpoint, our guidance assumption is that it has no impact to growth meaning that we think that bad debt, net of governmental rental receipts and all of the above is the same in \u201822 as what it is in \u201821. What you're seeing in the second quarter is really the volatility in timing because you will recall from the first quarter that we had a little bit of a harder time with bad debt and then we had a better time in the second quarter, etcetera. So this number can be fairly volatile. As you get into the back half of the year, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the rental relief programs are winding down. So we don't expect a lot more rental relief money in the back half of the year. We got a lot of it in the back half of last year. So it's going to be a little bit of a headwind to year-over-year growth in the back half. But from a full year standpoint, again, shouldn't have any impact. Yes. I think the core driver that will be consistent throughout is kind of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which is just reducing our exposure to labor pressure, whether it's in the payroll line item where it's the most obvious, right, which you see us having put up were literally probably on the 4 years in a row of either sub-1% or negative kind of payroll growth, we still have opportunity there, right. And so I think that's the engine of innovation and utilization and technology, and we will be able to completely or continue to sustain that kind of lower than inflationary growth going forward. That should also parlay itself into repairs and maintenance to a degree, too, because you get that benefit because there is a labor component embedded there with contractors, etcetera. So, I think that's the driver of where I think we have the most containment opportunity. Clearly, as you move into future years, real estate taxes will get harder from a comp standpoint and probably won't be as sustainable. But comps like utilities should get better, we hope hopefully that the commodity inflationary pressure that exists in the world today is more temporary than permanent. And so that should help us and hopefully offset other line items that might return to more normal growth. But again, the controllable part is really the labor hours, the payroll, the technology, the innovation, and that's where we are focused."

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\nMarty McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2022 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, are here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. In a minute, Michael Manelis will walk you through a market update, and then we will take your questions. The growth in our business continues as evidenced by our first quarter performance. Demand is strong and lease rates are growing faster than we expected. While we are well aware of the recent increases in economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we continue to manage our business by focusing on our operation dashboards, not on the news headlines. Those dashboards continue to nearly universally flash a green signal as our well-located properties and excellent service attract our affluent renter demographic in droves, allowing us to retain a record number of our residents and push rents up nearly everywhere we operate. All of this allowed us to increase normalized funds from operations by 13% in the quarter and we expect this growth to accelerate over the next few quarters. As we mentioned in our March operating update, our first quarter same-store revenue results were negatively impacted by an increase in delinquency in Southern California. It appears to us that a relatively small number of Southern California residents, who had previously been good payers, declined to pay rent in order to apply for state rental relief funds. While we remain open to working with residents with true COVID-related hardships, this sort of behavior is not acceptable, and we will continue to work with these residents to obtain our full rental payment. Translating all this into the numbers, first quarter same-store revenue results were about 125 basis points lower than we anticipated due to these higher bad debt, partially offset by about 25 basis points of better rate growth, leaving the final quarterly same-store revenue number about 100 basis points lower than we expected when we gave you guidance back in very early February 2022. Normalized funds from operations in the quarter ended up being about $0.01 lower than we expected with a $0.02 per share or about $6 million hit from higher bad debt, offset by the better rate performance I just mentioned, and the better than expected expense performance that I'll discuss in a moment. As we think about the full year, we feel that we are in a stronger operating position than we had initially contemplated in our full year guidance with a better lease rate growth trajectory more than offsetting our now more cautious view of delinquency. Turning to expenses, our residents appreciate the increasingly seamless digital experience we are providing them, which in turn allows us to have a smaller and more focused property management team. As a result of these efficiencies as well as low property tax expense growth, we're able to deliver 2.5% same-store quarter-over-quarter expense growth in an increasingly inflationary climate. We look forward to continuing to drive innovation and to expanding our operating margins over the balance of the year, while creating remarkable experiences for our customers and for our employees. On the transaction side, as we expected, we did not have much activity in the first quarter. We purchased one asset in San Diego that we discussed in the release and after the quarter end, sold one asset in New York. With that, I'm going to ask Michael to fill you in on the operating details. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark. We are pleased to report that we are seeing pricing power ahead of our expectations. Strong demand is being driven by the desire of affluent residents to live in our well-located properties, both urban and suburban. We have talked in previous calls about the recovery in our business being connected more to the lifestyle that our residents crave and less to how many days workers are expected to be in the office and that pattern continues. I have visited several of our markets over the last few months, and I am excited by the vibrancy that I'm seeing. We reported 96.4% occupancy for the quarter, which is 140 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with our expectations. First quarter reported turnover of 8.7% was over 100 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2021 and represents the lowest reported turnover in the history of our company. This trend reaffirms the desirability of our product as our existing residents signed renewals at record levels with increases that averaged 11.9% in the first quarter. This trend continues into the second quarter with preliminary April renewal increases averaging 12.5% with approximately 60% of our residents renewing. We are limiting rate negotiations, given the strength and demand of new residents, willing to pay full price to live in our communities. As we begin our primary leasing season, we feel really good about our pricing position, which includes the near elimination of concession usage across the portfolio outside of Seattle and is translating into robust new lease change performance with April on track to deliver just over 17.5% new lease growth after posting over 15% in the first quarter. Now, let me give you some color on the markets. Beginning with Boston. Boston is following normal seasonal patterns with improving demand and pricing heading towards the spring. We're almost 97% occupied and the market is benefiting from the big college campuses being opened and the return of international students and workers and the continued strong demand drivers from lab and life sciences, financial firms, healthcare and education. Competition from new supply will be modest and market performance should be strong. New York continues to thrive and was our best performing market in the first quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of 13.6%. We're 96.9% occupied and continue to expect this market to be our best performer in 2022. Demand is robust. We're renewing about 60% of our residents, which is healthy, but 5% lower than at the beginning of the year. This is primarily due to deal seekers choosing to move out versus paying the higher current price. But it is not a concern since we are easily able to attract new residents at these higher rates. We still expect to feel some pressure from new supply on the Jersey waterfront and Brooklyn later this year. Washington, D.C. is performing as expected with residential same-store revenue growth of 3% in the first quarter. This market was our best performing East Coast market in 2021. And as I mentioned in the past has the least ground to make up. As is often the case in D.C. new supply is likely to pressure rate growth in the market that the metro area continues to boast record absorption. Strong employment across job sectors in the market is driving this demand and we are 96.7% occupied. We are renewing about 60% of our residents and feel good about our positioning for the spring leasing season. Before I talk about our West Coast markets, let me give you a little color on our expansion markets. Denver continues to demonstrate very strong demand, we\u2019re almost 98% occupied and delivered same-store revenue growth of almost 13% in the first quarter. Despite turnover being on the higher end, we are seeing very good pricing power and healthy occupancy. In Atlanta, our acquisitions are performing ahead of their performance as the market continues to produce strong rent growth. Dallas and Austin continue to enjoy robust demand driven by very good in-migration and job growth in these markets. Out of the West Coast, Seattle continues to be slow to recover compared to the other markets, particularly in the downtown submarket. The good news is that the city's new mayor is focused on the quality of life issues, which we expect will have a positive impact. Also job postings in the market are at the highest level we have seen with Amazon leading the pack with over 19,000 positions posted with 16,000 of them being in the city of Seattle, which is a good sign for future apartment demand. Market occupancy in Seattle currently sits just above 95%, which remains behind our expectations and turnover, albeit within historical norms was the highest of all of our markets. The suburban portfolio is outperforming the city with the Bellevue/Redmond submarket, seeing immediate demand improvement in March after Microsoft returned to the office announcement. Year-to-date pricing remains flat in the downtown submarket with approximately 60% of new applications receiving a concession at just over a month and occupancy in this submarket is at 93%. Overall, we expect continued strength in the suburban portfolio and remain optimistic that pricing power and occupancy will improve in the downtown submarket as we are just now beginning to see signs of increasing demand as the quality of life issues continue to slowly improve. San Francisco has also lagged the recovery, but at the moment, feels on stronger footing than Seattle. We are very encouraged by the recent announcements from Mayor Breed and the local large employers about a commitment to bringing office workers back to the city, which should help address quality of life issues downtown. There has been consistently good demand and early signs of improved pricing power that the market lacked in 2021, we\u2019re almost 97% occupied and resident retention has improved from a year ago. Google, which has asked workers to return this month made a recent announcement that it is investing more than $3.5 billion in California, including a big chunk in the Bay Area with significant projects in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and Downtown San Jose, all areas where we have a significant number of communities. Pricing trend has increased almost 6.5% since the beginning of the year, which is better than the normal seasonal expectations, which would be in the 4% to 5% range. While this market\u2019s pricing remains below pre-pandemic levels, the good news is that initial indicators point to a continued strong recovery of the market. Now let me move to Southern California, three markets that have performed exceptionally well, but for elevated delinquency. First, Orange County and San Diego continue to show remarkable performance with high occupancy and strong retention supporting very good new lease rents. Home prices in these markets are out of reach for many of our residents, which is evident by the significant decline of move out citing this reason during the quarter. We expect to see continued record high retention likely impacted by the local regulations, limiting our allowable increases, increasing home prices and very limited competitive new supply. The result of these factors should allow us to maintain elevated pricing power throughout the year in these markets. Next, Los Angeles. Even with elevated delinquency LA continues to be a star performer. The entertainment content creation business is really thriving and driving demand. Occupancy is almost 97% and pricing power is strong and better than expected. The urban markets performance is now on par with the suburban portfolio, a scenario, which we have not seen since the onset of the pandemic. The percent of residents renewing is the highest we have seen likely due to the impact of the local regulations limiting our allow renewal increases and we expect to continue to renew between 60% and 70% of our residents. Now that rent relief coverage is no longer available for April 2022 rents. We have seen an early uptick in payment activity, but remain cautious. I was in Southern California two weeks ago and I am very encouraged by what I saw. Our onsite teams continue to actively engage our non-paying residents and are just now beginning to see a few positive signs, either through payments being made or in some cases, residents deciding to move out and give us their apartments. Overall, the strength and demand and quality of our portfolio clearly points to above average performance for our Southern California markets as the delinquency issue slowly clears. On the innovation front, we finished deploying our centralized renewal process in the first quarter and are now focused on centralizing our application process. As we mentioned last quarter, the foundation of our operating platform is in place and we are focused on further process automation and multi-site coverage that will create additional efficiencies, while continuing to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers and provide them a seamless digital customer experience. Let me thank the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. These are exciting times for our industry and the overall operations of our company. Not only are we on track to have a very strong year of financial performance, but we are also advancing our platform. Resident expectations are constantly evolving and our teams continue to focus on leveraging technology to meet those needs and drive operational excellence. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. Hoping to get more color on the Southern California delinquency issues. When did it first start to pop up? How many residents? Is it, how many are paying now and then is it kind of widespread across Southern California or is it concentrating specific buildings?\nBob Garechana: Nick, it\u2019s Bob. I\u2019ll start with that. So we had about \u2013 we\u2019ve had concentration of bad debt in Southern California, as you mentioned. And in particular I think Los Angeles and the city of Los Angeles specifically. And if you drill down even a little bit further there\u2019s a handful of specific assets where it\u2019s even more concentrated. And that was true of most of 2021. It peaked in terms of severity in September of last year and then had pretty stabilized and started to improve slightly in the fourth quarter, which shaped some of our perspective in our guidance. What changed or what happened in the first quarter was you saw a little bit of an uptick in terms of \u2013 as Mark mentioned in the prepared remarks of residents, again, concentrated in those specific areas of about 300 more people that didn\u2019t pay. We believe that may have been driven by the fact that they were applying for more rent relief. But they had previously been paying and now they stopped. And so you went from that kind of increase overall. As you go into April and again, it\u2019s early and we haven\u2019t finished up the month as Michael mentioned. It appears that many of those people are at least starting to pay their April rent. Now what\u2019s changed also is that under the rent relief program, you could only have March eligibility. So rent that was through March of 2022 is eligible for the rental relief program. April is not. And so that probably is changing the behavior as well as some other opportunities we have to just communicate with residents, et cetera.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And then Bob, can you just remind us the bad debt policy and then what guidance is assuming for net bad debt for the remainder of this year?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So our bad debt policy in terms of our write-ups is once you get 3 times behind your rent, we would write or reserve against. And we also write-off any debt associated with people who move out. So there\u2019s that combination. Also if you were kind of 3 times, but got rent relief, so you weren\u2019t the actual payer. We also reserve against that. So it\u2019s a pretty conservative policy and looking at kind of what the residents themselves is doing from a payment standpoint. And that policy hasn\u2019t changed since kind of the beginning of the pandemic or even prior to that overall. And what was the second part of your question, Nick, other than the policy?\nNick Joseph: What maintained 2022 guidance assumes from net bad debt?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So our initial guidance back in January assumed that we would based on kind of our experience in the fourth quarter, to be honest with you, that I just mentioned thought that we would before rental relief start seeing improvement in the first quarter and then accelerate improvement, meaning more people paying or just moving out as we went through the remainder of the year. What happened based on the first quarter has made us adjust that perspective a little bit and that we still think that we will see the improvement, but it\u2019ll probably be less pronounced and it\u2019ll be further back in the year. Offsetting some of that change, so more impactful is the number offsetting. Some of that change is we now think we\u2019ll probably have higher rental relief, right? So based on what occurred to us. So net-net bad debt is probably going to be flat to maybe marginally helpful to growth between 2021 and 2022. Whereas, previously we had assumed that it would be a contributor to growth. The good news is that everything else that Michael talked about in terms of pricing and everything else relative to guidance is actually more than offsetting that like Mark mentioned. So we feel very good about how we\u2019re positioned going into the leasing season.\nNick Joseph: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just maybe speak to the June and July renewal increases that are being sent out to just help us frame against the April. And maybe how those numbers compare to when you set guidance several months ago? Where are those renewals and new leases in context of the revenue growth that you have currently out there?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So, Steve, this is Michael. So first, basically when we\u2019re looking at renewals right now, we\u2019re not completely done issuing quotes through kind of July. But if we would just step back and look at where we are for April and May and even preliminary June, we\u2019re still putting out quotes that range somewhere between 14% and 15% for these months, which is probably about 200 basis points stronger than what we originally contemplated, which is just this intra period kind of strength that we see. We do expect that renewal \u2013 achieved renewal increase will moderate, especially on a net effective basis as we get into the back half of the year. Because when we look at even the July expirations, only 5% of our expirations for the month of July had a concession when they moved in a year ago. So I think that right there is going to put a little bit of pressure just on our ability to post 12.5% achieved renewal increases. But right now the overall performance and even what we see for the next 90 days probably trending about 200 bps higher than what we saw.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay, great. And I guess Bob, maybe just going back to the guidance. I mean I know the bad debt caught you guys by surprise and probably, certainly limited your desire at this point to kind of raise guidance. You see how things play out. But sounds like all the things Michael\u2019s talked about trend wise are definitely better than maybe what you thought at the start of the year. So, if this 125 or 100 basis point drag in Q1 really abates in Q2 and beyond. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to think through the potential upside to the numbers that you\u2019ve currently got out there. Like how much wiggle room do you have to kind of revisit guidance next quarter?\nMark Parrell: Steve, it\u2019s Mark. We feel like we\u2019re extraordinarily well positioned. I mean, the team would actually tell you we\u2019ve never been in as good a spot. So we feel really good about that conversation we\u2019re going to have with you in July about where the numbers are going to go. But we are entering into the beginning of the leasing season. It\u2019s really hard to predict on the bad debt side. We may get more reimbursements, California may slow down. It\u2019s just really unpredictable. So the exact place we\u2019re going to end up, but do we feel like there\u2019s upside to numbers? Absolutely.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then just one last question on transaction. Just given the move we\u2019ve seen in the bond market in the last call it, six weeks, eight weeks. I\u2019m just curious, are you seeing unlevered IRR hurdles changing at all, levered buyers dropping out. Like I\u2019m just curious the transaction market, the dynamic that\u2019s out there with the sharp move in bond yields. And how is that influencing your desire to put capital out?\nAlec Brackenridge: Sure, Steve. This is Alec. You\u2019re right. The market has changed a lot in the last three or four weeks from an interest rate standpoint. But there are countervailing forces at work. There\u2019s still all this capital of flowing into our sector. And operating results are still so good. It\u2019s a really attractive place for people to put money. And so I would say more that the frostiness is gone, where a month or two ago we had multiple bidders going in and over ask and really bidding the pricing up. And frankly, we didn\u2019t buy in that environment, because we thought it got so overheated. So right now it\u2019s kind of a feeling out process. But I don\u2019t see distress sellers out there. Operations are really strong and there\u2019s still as I said, a lot of interest in buying it. So I don\u2019t see any fire sales coming and certainly not for us. And when you ask about cost of capital for us, that\u2019s really comes from our dispositions. And we expect to continue to be able to sell at low cap rates and redeploy that money non-delusively into our new expansion market.\nMark Parrell: And Steve it\u2019s Mark. Just to build on that. I think very \u2013 already very complete answer. Interest rates right now that two year and 10 year treasury are just back to where they were in early to mid 2019. And I know you know this. We\u2019re not at some crazy new interest rate level. And yet our growth prospects are much better now for the industry, for our company than they were in 2019. Now a lot of that\u2019s been capitalized into the value of these assets being much higher now than in 2019. But I still think that growth picture, which doesn\u2019t have any fractures in it at all for us. And I think for most of the industry is very supportive of values. I\u2019ll also add, I think the private market is recognized and I think the public market is increasingly recognizing that apartments are very, very resilient. I mean, this pandemic was about the worst thing that could happen to an urban apartment owner. And yet we\u2019re 25 months out of the start of that and we\u2019re telling you about how well everything\u2019s performing, how well occupied we are again, how we\u2019re moving rents up. So I think the combination of the market\u2019s perception and the resiliency of the product, especially compared to all the volatility and other investment alternatives combined with just the growth prospects makes us feel pretty good about value going forward. And maybe that exception is if you get into a stagflation environment where the pressures would be a little different, but we feel pretty strongly that values are going to hang in there for us.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for the time. Alec, just a few follow-up questions to the transaction comments. So the dispositions you have teed up out in the market right now, could you just give us a little bit of color how the bidding intent for those assets has changed in terms of any rerating you\u2019re seeing or the number of bidders getting whittled down, particularly on the levered buyer side?\nAlec Brackenridge: Sure, John. So I would say at this point there\u2019s some bidders that are stepping back for sure. They\u2019re relying on higher leverage. It\u2019s harder for them to make it underwrite. But I can tell you that both what we\u2019ve been competing to buy and what we\u2019ve had on the market has seen a lot of interest. And then we see a lot of tours on stuff we\u2019ve just put on the market recently. And so far haven\u2019t seen a dramatic move in pricing. So really can\u2019t make a call on that. I would just say there is this feeling out sense that buyers and sellers are just going to determine whether there\u2019s a market right now. And at this point, it really feels like there will be, there\u2019s just so much capital out there.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. New York, specifically the additional sales that we can expect in the coming quarters, should we expect these low to mid 3% cap rates that we saw on 140 Riverside assets?\nAlec Brackenridge: Yes. That\u2019s generally been the case in the market and certainly for the properties that we\u2019re looking or thinking about selling. That would be generally the case.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: Good morning, guys. So I wanted to maybe talk about turnover for a second. I think on an annualized basis, you guys were just a shy below 35%. Do you think that\u2019s sort of the new normal? Or do you think that will pick up in the peak leasing season? And maybe more specifically, can you walk through what\u2019s driving sort of the collapse in the turnover rate. Is it really because there\u2019s no place to live and so people are just taking the renewals that you\u2019re giving them and saying, well, it\u2019s better than trying to find another apartment.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Rich, this is Michael. So first just there is normal seasonality to turnover by quarter. So the first quarter typically is one of the lower kind of reported turnover numbers. And it will tick-up as you work your way through the leasing season and then kind of fall back off again in the fourth quarter. But the fact that we reported at 8.7% normal historical, like going back into 2018 and 2019 and even 2017, typically the first quarter is like right around 10%. So you could see that kind of improvement that we\u2019re seeing. My guess is that as we work our way through the second and third quarter, yes, it will tick-up, but it is still going to stay relatively low compared to comparative norms part of which is what you just said, which is the optionality, where are residents going to go? We\u2019re delivering great service to our residents. So our customer service scores are kind of maintaining at the all time high levels. The price point that we\u2019re offering is competitive in the marketplace. And there\u2019s still a little bit of this lift that we\u2019re seeing in retention regarding kind of just regulatory limits that we\u2019re bumping up against that is keeping some of these quotes while there\u2019s still significant increases below what the otherwise market price would be. And again, that\u2019s just a matter of time as we work our way through kind of another cycle of renewals with those residents that will catch up to those market rates.\nRich Hill: Got it. And so what that tells me is, I know you\u2019ve emphasized this a couple times. But pricing power is significantly in your favor. And so if we\u2019re thinking about new leases and renewals, I have a hard time believing that there\u2019s very little that could lead that to start to roll over. Is that a fair assessment? And I have a quick follow-up to that.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I don\u2019t know exactly what you mean by rollover. But I would tell you just looking at the strength of like the reported new lease, renewals and blended, right? Knowing where the intra period rent growth is today, we are going to produce stronger results in the second quarter than what we originally anticipated based on that strength. But we still have a difficult comp period as we turn the corner into the second half just based on the recovery of rents last year. So they will start to moderate off in the second half, but relative to our original expectations, strong early intra period rent growth is the biggest catalyst to produce revenue growth in the current year. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now.\nRich Hill: Understood. That\u2019s helpful. I shouldn\u2019t have used rollover. I was asking a rate of change questions. So thank you for that. Could you maybe just talk about supply real quickly. Starts and permits across the United States are pretty high here. Do you think all those permits are going to become starts? And do you think those starts are going to be delivered on time?\nAlec Brackenridge: Rich, it\u2019s Alec. I\u2019ll start and others can chime in. But generally, there haven\u2019t been that many projects that have stopped at all that I\u2019m aware of, that we see in the market. But everything\u2019s gotten harder. So things are taking longer to deliver. So typically about a three month or so lag. So things that are in the pipeline will deliver a little more slowly. In terms of things that are being underwritten right now to generate future supply that\u2019s certainly gotten more challenging. It\u2019s a combination of costs going up. And costs that were going up say, 0.5% a month are now going up 1% a month. And even things like lumber, which may have abated a little bit are now being offset by steel going up pretty dramatically. So it\u2019s a cost challenge on top of which interest rates are up. So all of those things are going to combine to make development a little more challenging to underwrite in the future, we haven\u2019t seen that stop anything yet. But if you just look out it does get harder to make the numbers work.\nRich Hill: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So I wanted to talk about rent control. The narrative has definitely heightened as we have seen sort of these staggering great numbers. So could you perhaps talk about what you are seeing in your circles? Not necessarily in the markets that you are in already, but just generally in the markets that you are planning to kind of expand your presence in? And how do you think the pars to be sold a housing crisis that rent control is being offered as one solution to.\nMark Parrell: Thank you for that question, Chandni it\u2019s Mark. What I\u2019d say is that rent control continues to be a conversation, not just in the coastal markets as you implied, but also in places like Florida and other jurisdictions. Because again, as you noted, rents are up significantly. In some of our coastal markets, they\u2019re frankly just \u2013 these big increases are frankly just recovering the rents to where they were in 2019. In some places they\u2019re significantly higher, like in Southern California. So there\u2019s a little bit of that. We have had residents, especially our residents have their incomes continue to rise, which is an offsetting factor. But the biggest thing is we just need to keep as an industry focused and have these conversations with policy makers and in some cases voters about that rent control doesn\u2019t work. And we\u2019re doing that. The industry is very well organized on these topics. We continue to have these conversations. They\u2019re relatively productive. I mean, rent control just \u2013 New York set forms of rent control since World War II and it\u2019s the highest cost housing market in the country. I mean, it just doesn\u2019t work. And we\u2019re continuing to advocate for zoning reforms, continuing to advocate for regulatory reforms, public-private partnerships, like the 485w program in New York that we do hope gets going. So the industry is aware, we acknowledge the problem of a lack of affordable housing in the country. But that problem is a problem that is in some regards of the government\u2019s making and we need their cooperation here with some effective policies to improve. So we do see it as a risk. And one of the reasons you see our strategy diversifying is to diversify away from that risk. New York\u2019s a great market for us. It\u2019s going to have league leading revenue growth. Some of the assets we\u2019re selling, we intended to sell well before the pandemic for tax abatement reasons 421a type reasons or ground leases or whatnot, but it is also part of just diversifying into some markets that may be a little less political risk and having a company that can have a little less volatility and compound cash flows more reliably going forward. So we're really excited where we're headed, and this rent control topic does influence our capital allocation.\nChandni Luthra: Thank you. Thank you for that insight. And if I could follow up with a question on seasonality now that you're entering your peak leasing season. Pardon my voice. What are you seeing from a seasonality standpoint? Is it typical? Is it still atypical? Any thoughts in terms of are we back to where you were versus 2019 seasonality patterns? Any color on that would be very helpful.\nMichael Manelis: Yes, sure. So this is Michael. So typically, in a normal year, the way to think about kind of transaction volume seasonality is about 20% occurs in the first and fourth quarter and about 30% occurs in the second and third quarter. We did see a little bit of a shift, right, as we were working our way through kind of the recovery in 2021. And right now, I will tell you, we are getting very close back to those normal kind of percentages by quarter. We did have slightly more expirations in the first quarter of this year. It was like 24% versus the 20% norm. But as we're working our way through these new leases and renewals, I think it's just a matter of time. By next year, we're going to be right back in line with those numbers.\nChandni Luthra: Okay, thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the bad debt number that you gave. I think you said, it was \u2013 $6 million was the uptick in bad debt versus what you expected. And I wasn't sure if that was \u2013 should we think about that $6 million is only applying to those 300 additional people that didn't pay that you cited in Southern California? Or is there other pieces within that $6 million?\nBob Garechana: Hi, Nick, it's Bob. There's other pieces associated with it. It's probably about half of the 300 people that didn't pay that we mentioned earlier and the other half is, really we had anticipated improvement based on our fourth quarter experience, and we didn't see any improvement, right. So it's staying flat relative to our expectations that you were going to actually go down and then on top of it, adding these 300 people.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just other question is on, I know this is an issue that's probably going to play out in New York. I don't know if it's also in maybe in San Francisco or some other markets that had heightened concessions where you had some residents move into the portfolio over the last year and a half at the discounted rents when three months were given. Those leases, I think, in New York, we've just heard in the market increasingly are starting to turn in second quarter summer. And I guess I'm just wondering if you have any early read on how some of those conversations are going in terms of the resident who got a bunch of free rent is now being pushed up to market, and what's happening \u2013 the market itself is very tight, so maybe the person can move, but any sort of anecdotal color you're hearing on that topic would be helpful. Thanks.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Hi, Nick. This is Michael. So I said something in my prepared remarks about in New York. In the first quarter, we were renewing about 60% of our residents versus like the historical norm from the fourth quarter and third quarter of last year. That was up at like 65%. So we did see a little bit of that drop off. And what we started to hear back in like late February, early March, as some of those folks from Manhattan were looking at those increases and actually choosing to go across the river into the Hudson Waterfront to trade down from a rent perspective. But given the strength of the demand that we see at the front door, I mean we are more than okay kind of with that trade-off occurring. And as we look into April, May and even like this preliminary June, it really isn't materially different. We still expect to renew a large percentage of our residents in New York, but we will allow some of that trade out. We centralized our renewal negotiation team, which really allows us to kind of be very strategic and tighten up kind of renewal negotiations to ensure that we're consistent in these markets. And right now, the results appear to be very consistent to us.\nMark Parrell: And Nick, just to add, you might remember, we qualify everyone on the basis of their base rent. So they may have gotten a one or two month concession from us, but they can afford to pay that face rent. So they may react to any increase above the face rent, but the disappearance of a one month concession on our financial statements is an 8% increase in revenues, but they've been paying us 11 months' worth of that higher face rent. So for them, there's no change beyond what Michael and his team pushed above face rent. So again, it will look a little different on the financial statements than it will to the resident at hand.\nMichael Manelis: But we really are at the tail end of this because the concessions really ramped down last year. So by the time we hit July, there's very few of those residents that had those big concessions when they came in.\nNick Yulico: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: Hi, good morning everyone. You mentioned in the prepared comments a decline in residents moving out to buy a home in San Diego. I'm curious if that's a trend that you've seen across the rest of the portfolio as well.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So during the first quarter, we did see a decline in the percent of residents that site buying home is the reason when they move out. Remember, the turnover was low. So the absolute number of residents leaving to go buy home is materially down, and the percentage ticked down to about 11.5% of move out citing that reason pretty much in line with our historical norms of like an 11% to 12%, but reduced from like the 15% that we were seeing in the fourth quarter and third quarter of last year. I think right now what you're starting to see is just the supply constraints, the cost of single-family housing in our markets, rising mortgage rates, we expect that is going to keep this percent at a very low end, which really eliminates pressure on move-outs from this reason going forward.\nMark Parrell: And because renewals are so high, the absolute number of people actually moving is really small. I mean when you talk about a percentage, that's one thing, but the 10% or 11% is being applied against a much smaller number of people that are, in fact, leaving us at all for any reason.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then have you seen any change in demand for one bedrooms versus two bedrooms? I'm just trying to see if people are starting to double up again given the increase in rates.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So \u2013 this is Michael. We really haven't seen kind of any change right now. We're back to like a pre-pandemic levels where we average about 1.7 adults per kind of occupied unit in the portfolio. What I will tell you is, what we've seen is through the pandemic studios were the lowest occupied unit type that we had. I talked a little bit that we were seeing the trends of the recovery in the portfolio of that unit type. But even sitting here today in the first quarter, studios were 95.9% occupied, and today, they're at 96%. So they're still trailing the other unit type mix, which if we're going to have vacancy in the portfolio, I'm okay with that vacancy being at the lower price point unit of a studio.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. You have a fair amount of debt expiring this year and next. There is no debt offerings in your guidance. What are your thoughts of refinancing some of that debt with equity given your implied cost of equity is lower than your long-term cost of debt?\nBob Garechana: So I'll start with the debt maturity real quick and then maybe Mark and I will tag games. So this year, we don't have much debt maturing, John, actually. And then next year, we have the bigger amount of the $1.3 billion or so, some of which is secured and for various structural reasons needs to maintain secured. And then we literally have no debt maturing at all in 2024. So when you look at the profile over the three year time horizon, it's a pretty average to below average kind of maturity profile. And we have lots of flexibility in the markets, at least in the debt markets to refinance, whether that's shorter dated, longer dated, fixed, floating, secured, unsecured, kind of the full access to the capital. Our leverage is also very low relative to kind of targets and other things, and it will be continue to be low, particularly as the recovery and just the overall business performance is great. So \u2013 and maybe I'll let Mark talk a little bit about the equity side.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And just thinking about cost, I appreciate the point that the sort of FFO yield as compared to interest rates may be lower, but the long-term cost of adding partners, which is effectively what equity is to the company. And when you have all of this, as Bob said, additional debt expansion capability, when you have all this additional availability on the debt side, that seems to us to be dilutive at this point. I don't feel like the stock is trading above our NAV estimates internally. So again, that doesn't seem to us to be the best idea right now relative to just refinancing. And I think Bob and his team have done a good job of giving us a multitude of options. I mean we can go short. It doesn't have to be 10-year debt. Almost 20% of our debt was issued at 30-year maturities and expires in 28 years or more. So we've got the whole curve to use. We have 5% floating rate debt. Maybe we'll float some debt for a little while on the line. So I think we can manage this increase in rates pretty well without having to issue equity that I appreciate might feel cheaper, but to us kind of doesn't.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And Mark, you mentioned some of the reasons for selling more New York assets and deemphasizing the market. Has a strong rebound in the rents in New York giving you any possible reconsidering this?\nMark Parrell: Yes, now, thanks for that question. I think we're really, to your point, kind of in an enviable position in New York. We got great properties and a great team running them, and the assets we're potentially going to sell and have sold have been assets that have had these ground lease accounting issues, have had these 421-a tax reassessment increases that are coming up in the near term that maybe have more intensive renovation plays that maybe aren't our thing to do or we \u2013 aren't things we believe in, but buyers would. So we're keeping the assets that we think are going to drive performance. We're going to have this, and we'll continue to have this amazing New York portfolio that will benefit from, I think, very limited supply from some good job growth. So I think owning New York the next couple of years is going to be great. I think it has to be balanced against these regulatory concerns. So this didn't change our mind on New York. This is something we wish we had sold some of these assets in the past, but the pandemic interfered with that, and we waited for them to recover. And now our investors are going to harvest those gains, and we're going to help with our diversification place to let the company is a little more balanced against some of these regulatory pressures. So \u2013 no, it doesn't make us reassess our position, but I mean we're really pleased on what we own in New York and what we'll own long-term. I think it will be a big driver in the next couple of years.\nJohn Kim: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Mr. Anderson, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRich Anderson: Apologies, on mute. So on the topic of guidance and your decision not to raise it, two of your peers did this quarter. You had done it last year at this time. So I don't think it's a policy thing for EQR. I'm just curious, is it entirely the unknowns around bad debt that caused you to hold the line? Or were there other factors behind your decision to wait until next quarter to reassess guidance beyond just the bad debt issue?\nMark Parrell: Hi, Rich, it's Mark. Last year was a year like no other. So I would say, saying what our behavior is off of last year, we were \u2013 we had \u2013 really challenged trying to figure out guidance. Other folks didn't even bother giving guidance in 2021, and we at least told you where we thought the business was. And then, obviously, the recovery was really vigorous. In 2019 and 2018, we didn't raise at the April mark. So it is kind of our general view here since I've been here in 2007, not to do much in April. And the reason for that is we try to give you a real hard good look when we issued guidance early in February. I mean the other guidance changes really took the numbers to our range. We had the highest range. So again, that was only a couple of months ago and there just isn't enough time in the period. I mean we think we gave you a pretty high-quality estimate. For everyone's portfolio is different, everyone's process is different. But I think we started off with a higher number, so we don't have to adjust it in April. And we're sort of looking at July and going at that point, we'll have a real good sense of where the leasing season is going. We will \u2013 we hope, adjust the guidance ranges appropriately, but it isn't just a matter of you do it, you create guidance ranges so you can definitely raise every quarter, that isn't our goal.\nRich Anderson: Okay, fair enough. I appreciate that. Second question is you and your multifamily peers have been kind of gifted with this incredible environment. And we can all see what 2022 is going to look like, and I hate to say it, but the conversation is going to shift to 2023 really soon here. I'm curious, what you're doing differently, given this unprecedented level of growth that you're enjoying? And how that might be influencing longer-term plans? I doubt EQR, given the quality of the organization is, just taking the money and running and hoping for the best in 2023. Is this causing you \u2013 this environment causing you to maybe do things a little bit differently so you can lock in some of this growth for next year and thereafter maybe longer-term leases? I don't know what it would be, but I'm just curious if there is a change in strategy so that you can extend the lifeline of what's happening today.\nMark Parrell: Maybe we'll split that up into two pieces. On the operations side, this custom of one year leases is so deep in our business that it's really hard, Rich, for us. I mean in New York, we have to offer two year leases, and we just don't have a lot of uptake on that, and we haven't seen a lot of uptake on that anywhere in the country. So it's an interesting idea, and we've tried that before, and we just have not had a lot of progress on that. So on the operations side, I think all the things we're doing in Michael's world to manage expenses better because this inflationary pressure on payroll is real, and it isn't going to abate. And I think that is part of the 2023 conversation, and that I think it's something we're working really hard on. And we're making good progress, and you can see that in our numbers. So I think as we think about 2023, 2024, 2025, we're thinking we're going to live in an inflationary climate for a while, and we need to adjust to that by managing our people and processes as best we can. On the transaction side, the blessing here is that we're able to do this trade. I would have loved to have done it accretively. It was a little accretive last year, but we're able to switch into these new markets, much newer product, much less capital-intensive product without dilution is a wonderful thing, and we're taking full advantage of that. So the opportunity to sell product that's older product in markets that do have real regulatory challenges that we think a lot of private owners aren't that concerned about because they've got other things on their mind, that's an opportunity from our perspective. And we're selling into that opportunity.\nRich Anderson: Okay, fair enough. See you in New York.\nMark Parrell: Yes, thank you. See you there.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hi, everyone. I appreciate all the market color on the beginning. Just curious on the LA market. It looks like year-over-year same-store revenues were up 8.6%. What would that have been if you backed out the delinquency impacts?\nBob Garechana: Yes, that would have been a little over 200 basis points better. So something that would have been around, not dissimilar to what the reported Orange County in kind of San Diego were so like 11-ish percent.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then, Michael, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're working on, if I heard correctly, centralizing your \u2013 the application process. What's the benefit EQR expect to derive from this? Is it more on the expense front or better able to kind of drive revenue growth or something else?\nMichael Manelis: So it is \u2013 this is Michael. So it's really \u2013 it's just part of the overarching plan of just centralizing a lot of the on-site kind of tasks into a group where we can create that operating efficiency and running assets with fewer kind of folks in the office and really getting more into this multisite coverage kind of model. So that's really the biggest thing, which is layering in. We started with renewals. We saw the immediate benefit to kind of being able to create the guardrails and negotiation. Now we're looking at this application processing and creating efficiencies in that process and having fewer people having to be touch points with that and creating more of that seamless kind of experience kind of for prospects as they're going through, and then we'll move into kind of the evictions and delinquency. So we're looking at every single thing that gets done on site and saying is there an opportunity and benefit to the organization to streamline that process and have fewer touch points with it. And that's really the essence of what we're doing right now.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Awesome. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: We'll go next to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hi, there. So a couple of questions for me. First, Mark, maybe another one on transactions, but from a different angle. I know the transaction can be lumpy, but I guess I'm curious what the strategy you're thinking today here is? It's almost May and you've only done about $100 million of acquisitions, $200 million on the disposition side, well behind the $2 billion annualized pace. Like the questions and comments, if you're waiting for the market to settle down a bit here? Are you looking to perhaps sell a bit more aggressively now and buy more later given the surge in interest rates, anything under LOI today? So maybe some color on how you're thinking and maybe how we should think about maybe the pace of acquisition dispositions and if you have anything under LOI or far along today?\nAlec Brackenridge: Hi, Haendel, this is Alec. The whole market kind of took a pause at the beginning of the year, just because it had been so busy at the end of 2021. And certainly we were part of that. We closed literally five deals in the last two weeks of the year. So the whole market kind of took a break and then it started back up again, really in February. And from our perspective, I alluded to earlier, it was super frothy, really a lot of bidding wars going on, we were part of the process but we didn't feel like it was the time to step in, lean into that. Now the market seems to calm down a little bit. I think there's going to be an opportunity for us to get back on pace. And last year, where we bought \u2013 we sold 1.07 billion and bought a 1.07 billion. We didn't do anything in the first quarter either. So picking up to that pace is certainly our goal and certainly my job to make that happen. And we are pricing very actively right now.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. A question may be on the market, based on your comments this quarter versus last quarter. It seems to me that San Francisco might be the market where, which is perhaps standing out most in terms of expectations at the start of year versus now putting the bad debt issues in LA aside, obviously. So I guess I'm curious one is that fair and maybe what your sense of the market same-store revenue potential today in San Francisco versus kind of the 7% you outlined a few months ago?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So this is Michael. So I think the way I would look at this right now, if I think about intra period rent growth, the markets that I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks that are really kind of outperforming expectations of New York, San Francisco and LA, relative to San Francisco right now, you're just now starting to see some of that pricing power come back. So from our full year expectation, that was probably a seven at the beginning of the year, it's like a 50, 60 basis point improvement right now to the full year projection. But I think what I said in my prepared remarks is I'm more excited because we're seeing that pricing power improving week after week. So sequentially right now, we have a great opportunity as we head into May and June to write a lot of leases at a rate higher than what we otherwise thought, which would then add to those numbers.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Fair enough. Can you give us an updated loss to lease quote for the portfolio? Thanks. And that's my final question.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So as of April 15, the portfolio loss to lease remains at 11% for all leases in place. So really it's the strength of this intra period rent growth that has allowed us to maintain this loss to lease at a very high level sitting here in April, even though we just captured a whole bunch of it in the first quarter through this renewal and new lease process that you can see when you look at that blended rate that we reported for the quarter. So I think right now in the portfolio, there's 85% of the leases that are in place that are below current market pricing. And I think as we mentioned in the past, we're not going to be able to capture this full 11% this year, but the fact that this number remains 11% and is higher than what we otherwise would have expected it to be in April, really does put us in a great position for the portfolio, not only to contribute into 2022 revenue, but position it for 2023 to have stronger embedded growth.\nHaendel St. Juste: That's great color. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler.\nConnor Mitchell: Hi, thank you. So how soon can EQR turn the delinquent tenants over to the credit agencies?\nMichael Manelis: So this is Michael, so there's a lot of nuances to that. So for residents that have moved out that have balances with us, we are able to turn them over to a collection agency now and they can begin that process. There's periods of protected rent. So it's not as clean as is what it would've been a pre-pandemic period. What we are started to or what we've started to do in April is we are credit reporting now for folks with their April rent payments. And that's something that really kind of the law shifted around and we were able to kind of have that ability. So we are now reporting to the credit agencies each and every month, our residents ability to pay rent and any balances that they owe.\nConnor Mitchell: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then as EQR moves into the Sunbelt and non-coastal markets, the expansion markets, are you seeing any different affordability dynamics?\nAlec Brackenridge: Hi, Connor, it\u2019s Alec. When you say affordability about \u2013 affordable units on site or are you just saying generally about\u2026\nConnor Mitchell: Is it rent as a percentage?\nAlec Brackenridge: Okay. Rent as a percentage of \u2013 no, we're keeping in track generally low 20% rent is a percent of income and as we've talked about in the past, we're really finding the same general kind of renter who's working in the same general knowledge based industries. And has a growing income that supports rent growth over time.\nConnor Mitchell: Okay. Yes. Thank you. Sorry, if there was any confusion. So yes, I was really asking about if tenants are willing to spend more kind of the percent that you're talking about and then, compared to other markets like San Diego, that's been touched on a few times. \nAlec Brackenridge: So one of the dynamics is that we're growing off of a lower rent base as well so if the average rent is 2500 versus 4,000, we like that spot for a renter who has a good income.\nMark Parrell: We can take the next question, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Moving on we\u2019ll go to Anthony Powell with Barclays.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. A question on Los Angeles, you cited streaming content creation as a source of strength. There's been talk about some of the streaming providers cutting down their content spend given the competitive market there, how much frankly was driven by content creation. And how do you see the overall demand generators in LA?\nMichael Manelis: Yes, so this is Michael. So I think \u2013 well, one, some of the announcements that you're reading today is probably more going to be impacting the future into like a 2023. The demand in the LA market is really strong. I don't quantify like how many applications came to us from that content creation, but you can look at like the strength in West LA and really just the overall kind of inbound leads that we're seeing in the overall LA market. It's really strong on a year-over-year basis. And that's just one component of the strength of that market to generate demand. But I think the announcements that we've just saw in the last week or so really way too soon to understand if it's any impact on the future demand.\nMark Parrell: And you got to feel bullish about entertainment in general, how people will consume it has changed. I mean, many of us were older like me consumed it through network television. Now you're consuming it through streaming services and there may be a different way to consume entertainment, but LA as the one of the worldwide centers of the entertainment industry, that's a very powerful economic magnet. And again, even if streaming kind of does withdraw a little bit and maybe there are tighter budgets there, you may have more people going entertainers going direct to the audience, in a TikTok type format and needing production services for those sort of things outside of the streaming industry. So I just think entertainment can be consumed a lot of different ways, but I think LA has a central role and how that's all done. And I think one way or another will benefit from it, even if sort of some of the streaming stuff, these very elaborate productions become a little less.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Thanks. So maybe one more on rent to income. You said that it's still in a low 20, so there's really been no movement there even as you push rents higher. And how do you look at rent to income in an inflationary environment? Would you maybe like see a bit lower given there could be some other cost pressures outside of rent that may be impacting certain renters?\nAlec Brackenridge: Well, this is Alec. I mean, I would say our typical renter is also seeing their income going up pretty aggressively as well. So you see that particularly within the profile that we typically rent to. So that is keeping pace.\nBob Garechana: Yes. And at the overall portfolio, I mean, we're at 19.5% rent as a percent of income. And really when you look at move-ins from the first quarter, the only change that happened was New York that used to be the absolute low point at 17.5% ticked up to 18%, which still shows that from an overall affordability standpoint, those residents are going to be able to absorb additional increases.\nMark Parrell: And it's Mark, just to add a little to that, because this is important in the inflationary climate. And we had a lot of \u2013 we've had a lot of good conversations with investors about this point too. Our higher end rent are paying call it 20% of their income to us in rent with a lot of those folks commuting by public transit especially in the East Coast are less susceptible to some of these energy pressures because they are higher earners. They have more disposable income. So even if their energy and food costs are up, they're liable to be pinched less. I think the pressure implied in your question is more likely to incur \u2013 occur, pardon me. In Class B apartment buildings, in apartment properties in more further suburbs maybe in the SFR sector where people are a little more stressed than our renter.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Hate to go back to the bad debt question. But I'm curious, why did this happen? Just particularly in LA, if the extension was kind of done statewide through June 30, why is it only happened in LA. And then by June 30, when the protection is all kind of come off, do we kind of expect kind of a repeat of what we just kind of saw in 1Q?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So this is Michael, maybe I'll start and then others can kind of build in. So I think when you look at the concentration of our delinquency, it has been Southern California focus, but LA has always had the highest concentration of the overall delinquency in the portfolio. What we also saw early on into January is we saw rent relief payments actually slow down in January and February, as the programs were very focused on working on first time rent relief applications and really put everything that they call like a re-certification residents that were coming back for more. They put those kind of on hold. Now what we saw in March is they basically started to work those cases and net-net for the whole quarter, we came out right around where we thought we were going to be, but you can really look into April right now and look at this rent relief volume that we're seeing. And we're already over $5 million for the month of April. So you can see these programs catching up. So the concentration in LA is probably just due to the fact that is where the delinquency is. And there's also a lot of publication around these rent relief programs, in that market that kind of influences the behaviors of the renters there.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And it's Mark, I'm going to add a little to that. Because I think there is another regulatory impact that Michael alluded to there. I mean, in the city of Los Angeles, there is an eviction moratorium. I mean that still exists. There's exceptions to it. There's different actions we can take. I think residents have been diluted into thinking that means they don't have to pay their rent. When in fact, as Michael said, we can do other things to affect their credit and have other more pointed conversations. So I think in some places a moral hazard has been created by these, I think initially well intended, but now well overdue policies. And I think that's part of it. I think the reason you see it a little more in Southern California than in Northern California is because of that. And I think you \u2013 if these programs get extended, I think you're going to see very much more effective legal challenges to them because we're 25 months into the pandemic and all these emergency measures have expired. And the idea that this is the one measure that needs to keep going and that this cost needs to be put on landlords, as opposed to dealing with the housing crisis as a public good, that needs to be dealt with. I don't understand how that's going to work. I think there's going to be pressure on policy makers on that topic. So I think it's a combination of a little moral hazard, a little regulatory mischief, as well as just I think some PR in that market.\nOmotayo Okusanya: But what it does expire June 30, do you think the people just kind of stop paying? What do you expect to shock to the system at that point?\nMark Parrell: Our resident base is different. Yes. Our resident base is \u2013 we don't, I mean, this is troubling to us. Sure. But it's not deeply material. We just don't have a lot of evictions. I think we need to just keep having conversations with residents. There's no rent for giving this program at EQR. We will continue to pursue, we'll follow the rules, but we will be persistent. So I guess I'd say that we're going to advocate that these various eviction moratoriums have served their purpose and now should lapse. And we'll continue to have these direct conversations with our residents and a vast majority of them are paying and paying on time and like their service and like their property, but you can't live for free and you need to meet your financial obligations, meet your contractual obligations. And that's something we'll be diligent in following up on. So I guess I'd say to you, I think it is going to get better, and it's probably going to get better slower in LA than anywhere else.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Great, thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Moving on, we'll go to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. First quarter operating metrics such as same-store revenue growth and same-store NOI growth, we're below the low end of the full year range for reasons already discussed in depth. But how should we think about the pace of the acceleration of these metrics through the year and given the tougher comparisons in the back half, when does this peak or trying to get an updated view of the shape of the year and the exit rate into 2023? Thank you.\nBob Garechana: Yes. So this is Bob. So the shape is actually not changed all that materially, even with the negative impact on the first quarter from bad debt. So the first quarter was always in our mind going to be lower because you're getting this compounding effect of the rent roll, right. You're getting this compounding effect of like putting on these great new lease changes, great renewal rates, great blended piece. And so in our mindset, really Q2 and Q3 are going to be probably the peak above kind of midpoint, a full year guidance range performance from a same-store revenue standpoint that has to do with the comp period, right. And just kind of the comp period trajectory from Q2 and 21, but also just that compounding effect. And we felt like in our original guidance that you would then see more normal seasonality in the fourth quarter as you went into the fourth quarter. And so you'd see a little bit of a dip there. The question will be given where we sit today about how strong the leasing like the lead up to the leasing season is if that normal seasonality returns are not, right. We've had years where we've defied that normal seasonality. The setup, again, sitting here today feels like that normal seasonality might not be as pronounced as what we assumed in our initial guidance. So that feels pretty good. But I think we'll know more in July when we talk to you on the call and we'll be able to give you kind of a robuster view on that.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's very helpful and you've invested in technology initiatives and you still have higher than usual staffing vacancies. I'm just kind of wondering, when do these higher vacancies just become the norm and based on your investments, you kind of reached a new equilibrium between technology and employment levels.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So this is Michael. So in terms of staff vacancies on site, right now, the portfolio is running just below 7%, which is about a 100 basis points higher than what historically we see in the first quarter. It is nowhere near like what we saw in Q3 of last year, where we were like 10%, 11% kind of vacant positions on site. So a lot of that vacancy kind of has evaporated through recruiting efforts and really all of the work that we're doing right now around the centralization and creating these operating efficiencies, like we're still in the early innings of all of this coming through. And I think I've said in my prepared remarks, even last quarter that this stuff is going to go and flow into 2023 as well because we're redoing a lot of the onsite processes. But again, and a lot of the gain that you see in payroll is not from vacant physicians in the first quarter, it's from the efficiencies that were created.\nMichael Goldsmith: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And there are no further questions, I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.\nMark Parrell: Thank you all for your time on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you in conferences and in your offices over the next few months. Stay well. Thank you.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. We are pleased to report that we are seeing pricing power ahead of our expectations. Strong demand is being driven by the desire of affluent residents to live in our well-located properties, both urban and suburban. We have talked in previous calls about the recovery in our business being connected more to the lifestyle that our residents crave and less to how many days workers are expected to be in the office and that pattern continues. I have visited several of our markets over the last few months, and I am excited by the vibrancy that I'm seeing. We reported 96.4% occupancy for the quarter, which is 140 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with our expectations. First quarter reported turnover of 8.7% was over 100 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2021 and represents the lowest reported turnover in the history of our company. This trend reaffirms the desirability of our product as our existing residents signed renewals at record levels with increases that averaged 11.9% in the first quarter. This trend continues into the second quarter with preliminary April renewal increases averaging 12.5% with approximately 60% of our residents renewing. We are limiting rate negotiations, given the strength and demand of new residents, willing to pay full price to live in our communities. As we begin our primary leasing season, we feel really good about our pricing position, which includes the near elimination of concession usage across the portfolio outside of Seattle and is translating into robust new lease change performance with April on track to deliver just over 17.5% new lease growth after posting over 15% in the first quarter. Now, let me give you some color on the markets. Beginning with Boston. Boston is following normal seasonal patterns with improving demand and pricing heading towards the spring. We're almost 97% occupied and the market is benefiting from the big college campuses being opened and the return of international students and workers and the continued strong demand drivers from lab and life sciences, financial firms, healthcare and education. Competition from new supply will be modest and market performance should be strong. New York continues to thrive and was our best performing market in the first quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of 13.6%. We're 96.9% occupied and continue to expect this market to be our best performer in 2022. Demand is robust. We're renewing about 60% of our residents, which is healthy, but 5% lower than at the beginning of the year. This is primarily due to deal seekers choosing to move out versus paying the higher current price. But it is not a concern since we are easily able to attract new residents at these higher rates. We still expect to feel some pressure from new supply on the Jersey waterfront and Brooklyn later this year. Washington, D.C. is performing as expected with residential same-store revenue growth of 3% in the first quarter. This market was our best performing East Coast market in 2021. And as I mentioned in the past has the least ground to make up. As is often the case in D.C. new supply is likely to pressure rate growth in the market that the metro area continues to boast record absorption. Strong employment across job sectors in the market is driving this demand and we are 96.7% occupied. We are renewing about 60% of our residents and feel good about our positioning for the spring leasing season. Before I talk about our West Coast markets, let me give you a little color on our expansion markets. Denver continues to demonstrate very strong demand, we're almost 98% occupied and delivered same-store revenue growth of almost 13% in the first quarter. Despite turnover being on the higher end, we are seeing very good pricing power and healthy occupancy. In Atlanta, our acquisitions are performing ahead of their performance as the market continues to produce strong rent growth. Dallas and Austin continue to enjoy robust demand driven by very good in-migration and job growth in these markets. Out of the West Coast, Seattle continues to be slow to recover compared to the other markets, particularly in the downtown submarket. The good news is that the city's new mayor is focused on the quality of life issues, which we expect will have a positive impact. Also job postings in the market are at the highest level we have seen with Amazon leading the pack with over 19,000 positions posted with 16,000 of them being in the city of Seattle, which is a good sign for future apartment demand. Market occupancy in Seattle currently sits just above 95%, which remains behind our expectations and turnover, albeit within historical norms was the highest of all of our markets. The suburban portfolio is outperforming the city with the Bellevue/Redmond submarket, seeing immediate demand improvement in March after Microsoft returned to the office announcement. Year-to-date pricing remains flat in the downtown submarket with approximately 60% of new applications receiving a concession at just over a month and occupancy in this submarket is at 93%. Overall, we expect continued strength in the suburban portfolio and remain optimistic that pricing power and occupancy will improve in the downtown submarket as we are just now beginning to see signs of increasing demand as the quality of life issues continue to slowly improve. San Francisco has also lagged the recovery, but at the moment, feels on stronger footing than Seattle. We are very encouraged by the recent announcements from Mayor Breed and the local large employers about a commitment to bringing office workers back to the city, which should help address quality of life issues downtown. There has been consistently good demand and early signs of improved pricing power that the market lacked in 2021, we're almost 97% occupied and resident retention has improved from a year ago. Google, which has asked workers to return this month made a recent announcement that it is investing more than $3.5 billion in California, including a big chunk in the Bay Area with significant projects in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and Downtown San Jose, all areas where we have a significant number of communities. Pricing trend has increased almost 6.5% since the beginning of the year, which is better than the normal seasonal expectations, which would be in the 4% to 5% range. While this market's pricing remains below pre-pandemic levels, the good news is that initial indicators point to a continued strong recovery of the market. Now let me move to Southern California, three markets that have performed exceptionally well, but for elevated delinquency. First, Orange County and San Diego continue to show remarkable performance with high occupancy and strong retention supporting very good new lease rents. Home prices in these markets are out of reach for many of our residents, which is evident by the significant decline of move out citing this reason during the quarter. We expect to see continued record high retention likely impacted by the local regulations, limiting our allowable increases, increasing home prices and very limited competitive new supply. The result of these factors should allow us to maintain elevated pricing power throughout the year in these markets. Next, Los Angeles. Even with elevated delinquency LA continues to be a star performer. The entertainment content creation business is really thriving and driving demand. Occupancy is almost 97% and pricing power is strong and better than expected. The urban markets performance is now on par with the suburban portfolio, a scenario, which we have not seen since the onset of the pandemic. The percent of residents renewing is the highest we have seen likely due to the impact of the local regulations limiting our allow renewal increases and we expect to continue to renew between 60% and 70% of our residents. Now that rent relief coverage is no longer available for April 2022 rents. We have seen an early uptick in payment activity, but remain cautious. I was in Southern California two weeks ago and I am very encouraged by what I saw. Our onsite teams continue to actively engage our non-paying residents and are just now beginning to see a few positive signs, either through payments being made or in some cases, residents deciding to move out and give us their apartments. Overall, the strength and demand and quality of our portfolio clearly points to above average performance for our Southern California markets as the delinquency issue slowly clears. On the innovation front, we finished deploying our centralized renewal process in the first quarter and are now focused on centralizing our application process. As we mentioned last quarter, the foundation of our operating platform is in place and we are focused on further process automation and multi-site coverage that will create additional efficiencies, while continuing to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers and provide them a seamless digital customer experience. Let me thank the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. These are exciting times for our industry and the overall operations of our company. Not only are we on track to have a very strong year of financial performance, but we are also advancing our platform. Resident expectations are constantly evolving and our teams continue to focus on leveraging technology to meet those needs and drive operational excellence. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Yes. So, Steve, this is Michael. So first, basically when we're looking at renewals right now, we're not completely done issuing quotes through kind of July. But if we would just step back and look at where we are for April and May and even preliminary June, we're still putting out quotes that range somewhere between 14% and 15% for these months, which is probably about 200 basis points stronger than what we originally contemplated, which is just this intra period kind of strength that we see. We do expect that renewal \u2013 achieved renewal increase will moderate, especially on a net effective basis as we get into the back half of the year. Because when we look at even the July expirations, only 5% of our expirations for the month of July had a concession when they moved in a year ago. So I think that right there is going to put a little bit of pressure just on our ability to post 12.5% achieved renewal increases. But right now the overall performance and even what we see for the next 90 days probably trending about 200 bps higher than what we saw. Yes. Rich, this is Michael. So first just there is normal seasonality to turnover by quarter. So the first quarter typically is one of the lower kind of reported turnover numbers. And it will tick-up as you work your way through the leasing season and then kind of fall back off again in the fourth quarter. But the fact that we reported at 8.7% normal historical, like going back into 2018 and 2019 and even 2017, typically the first quarter is like right around 10%. So you could see that kind of improvement that we're seeing. My guess is that as we work our way through the second and third quarter, yes, it will tick-up, but it is still going to stay relatively low compared to comparative norms part of which is what you just said, which is the optionality, where are residents going to go? We're delivering great service to our residents. So our customer service scores are kind of maintaining at the all time high levels. The price point that we're offering is competitive in the marketplace. And there's still a little bit of this lift that we're seeing in retention regarding kind of just regulatory limits that we're bumping up against that is keeping some of these quotes while there's still significant increases below what the otherwise market price would be. And again, that's just a matter of time as we work our way through kind of another cycle of renewals with those residents that will catch up to those market rates. Yes. I don't know exactly what you mean by rollover. But I would tell you just looking at the strength of like the reported new lease, renewals and blended, right? Knowing where the intra period rent growth is today, we are going to produce stronger results in the second quarter than what we originally anticipated based on that strength. But we still have a difficult comp period as we turn the corner into the second half just based on the recovery of rents last year. So they will start to moderate off in the second half, but relative to our original expectations, strong early intra period rent growth is the biggest catalyst to produce revenue growth in the current year. And that's what we're seeing right now. Yes, sure. So this is Michael. So typically, in a normal year, the way to think about kind of transaction volume seasonality is about 20% occurs in the first and fourth quarter and about 30% occurs in the second and third quarter. We did see a little bit of a shift, right, as we were working our way through kind of the recovery in 2021. And right now, I will tell you, we are getting very close back to those normal kind of percentages by quarter. We did have slightly more expirations in the first quarter of this year. It was like 24% versus the 20% norm. But as we're working our way through these new leases and renewals, I think it's just a matter of time. By next year, we're going to be right back in line with those numbers. Yes. Hi, Nick. This is Michael. So I said something in my prepared remarks about in New York. In the first quarter, we were renewing about 60% of our residents versus like the historical norm from the fourth quarter and third quarter of last year. That was up at like 65%. So we did see a little bit of that drop off. And what we started to hear back in like late February, early March, as some of those folks from Manhattan were looking at those increases and actually choosing to go across the river into the Hudson Waterfront to trade down from a rent perspective. But given the strength of the demand that we see at the front door, I mean we are more than okay kind of with that trade-off occurring. And as we look into April, May and even like this preliminary June, it really isn't materially different. We still expect to renew a large percentage of our residents in New York, but we will allow some of that trade out. We centralized our renewal negotiation team, which really allows us to kind of be very strategic and tighten up kind of renewal negotiations to ensure that we're consistent in these markets. And right now, the results appear to be very consistent to us. But we really are at the tail end of this because the concessions really ramped down last year. So by the time we hit July, there's very few of those residents that had those big concessions when they came in. Yes. So during the first quarter, we did see a decline in the percent of residents that site buying home is the reason when they move out. Remember, the turnover was low. So the absolute number of residents leaving to go buy home is materially down, and the percentage ticked down to about 11.5% of move out citing that reason pretty much in line with our historical norms of like an 11% to 12%, but reduced from like the 15% that we were seeing in the fourth quarter and third quarter of last year. I think right now what you're starting to see is just the supply constraints, the cost of single-family housing in our markets, rising mortgage rates, we expect that is going to keep this percent at a very low end, which really eliminates pressure on move-outs from this reason going forward. Yes. So \u2013 this is Michael. We really haven't seen kind of any change right now. We're back to like a pre-pandemic levels where we average about 1.7 adults per kind of occupied unit in the portfolio. What I will tell you is, what we've seen is through the pandemic studios were the lowest occupied unit type that we had. I talked a little bit that we were seeing the trends of the recovery in the portfolio of that unit type. But even sitting here today in the first quarter, studios were 95.9% occupied, and today, they're at 96%. So they're still trailing the other unit type mix, which if we're going to have vacancy in the portfolio, I'm okay with that vacancy being at the lower price point unit of a studio. So it is \u2013 this is Michael. So it's really \u2013 it's just part of the overarching plan of just centralizing a lot of the on-site kind of tasks into a group where we can create that operating efficiency and running assets with fewer kind of folks in the office and really getting more into this multisite coverage kind of model. So that's really the biggest thing, which is layering in. We started with renewals. We saw the immediate benefit to kind of being able to create the guardrails and negotiation. Now we're looking at this application processing and creating efficiencies in that process and having fewer people having to be touch points with that and creating more of that seamless kind of experience kind of for prospects as they're going through, and then we'll move into kind of the evictions and delinquency. So we're looking at every single thing that gets done on site and saying is there an opportunity and benefit to the organization to streamline that process and have fewer touch points with it. And that's really the essence of what we're doing right now. Yes. So this is Michael. So I think the way I would look at this right now, if I think about intra period rent growth, the markets that I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks that are really kind of outperforming expectations of New York, San Francisco and LA, relative to San Francisco right now, you're just now starting to see some of that pricing power come back. So from our full year expectation, that was probably a seven at the beginning of the year, it's like a 50, 60 basis point improvement right now to the full year projection. But I think what I said in my prepared remarks is I'm more excited because we're seeing that pricing power improving week after week. So sequentially right now, we have a great opportunity as we head into May and June to write a lot of leases at a rate higher than what we otherwise thought, which would then add to those numbers. Yes. So as of April 15, the portfolio loss to lease remains at 11% for all leases in place. So really it's the strength of this intra period rent growth that has allowed us to maintain this loss to lease at a very high level sitting here in April, even though we just captured a whole bunch of it in the first quarter through this renewal and new lease process that you can see when you look at that blended rate that we reported for the quarter. So I think right now in the portfolio, there's 85% of the leases that are in place that are below current market pricing. And I think as we mentioned in the past, we're not going to be able to capture this full 11% this year, but the fact that this number remains 11% and is higher than what we otherwise would have expected it to be in April, really does put us in a great position for the portfolio, not only to contribute into 2022 revenue, but position it for 2023 to have stronger embedded growth. So this is Michael, so there's a lot of nuances to that. So for residents that have moved out that have balances with us, we are able to turn them over to a collection agency now and they can begin that process. There's periods of protected rent. So it's not as clean as is what it would've been a pre-pandemic period. What we are started to or what we've started to do in April is we are credit reporting now for folks with their April rent payments. And that's something that really kind of the law shifted around and we were able to kind of have that ability. So we are now reporting to the credit agencies each and every month, our residents ability to pay rent and any balances that they owe. Yes, so this is Michael. So I think \u2013 well, one, some of the announcements that you're reading today is probably more going to be impacting the future into like a 2023. The demand in the LA market is really strong. I don't quantify like how many applications came to us from that content creation, but you can look at like the strength in West LA and really just the overall kind of inbound leads that we're seeing in the overall LA market. It's really strong on a year-over-year basis. And that's just one component of the strength of that market to generate demand. But I think the announcements that we've just saw in the last week or so really way too soon to understand if it's any impact on the future demand. Yes. So this is Michael, maybe I'll start and then others can kind of build in. So I think when you look at the concentration of our delinquency, it has been Southern California focus, but LA has always had the highest concentration of the overall delinquency in the portfolio. What we also saw early on into January is we saw rent relief payments actually slow down in January and February, as the programs were very focused on working on first time rent relief applications and really put everything that they call like a re-certification residents that were coming back for more. They put those kind of on hold. Now what we saw in March is they basically started to work those cases and net-net for the whole quarter, we came out right around where we thought we were going to be, but you can really look into April right now and look at this rent relief volume that we're seeing. And we're already over $5 million for the month of April. So you can see these programs catching up. So the concentration in LA is probably just due to the fact that is where the delinquency is. And there's also a lot of publication around these rent relief programs, in that market that kind of influences the behaviors of the renters there. Yes. So this is Michael. So in terms of staff vacancies on site, right now, the portfolio is running just below 7%, which is about a 100 basis points higher than what historically we see in the first quarter. It is nowhere near like what we saw in Q3 of last year, where we were like 10%, 11% kind of vacant positions on site. So a lot of that vacancy kind of has evaporated through recruiting efforts and really all of the work that we're doing right now around the centralization and creating these operating efficiencies, like we're still in the early innings of all of this coming through. And I think I've said in my prepared remarks, even last quarter that this stuff is going to go and flow into 2023 as well because we're redoing a lot of the onsite processes. But again, and a lot of the gain that you see in payroll is not from vacant physicians in the first quarter, it's from the efficiencies that were created."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. In a minute, Michael Manelis will walk you through a market update, and then we will take your questions. The growth in our business continues as evidenced by our first quarter performance. Demand is strong and lease rates are growing faster than we expected. While we are well aware of the recent increases in economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we continue to manage our business by focusing on our operation dashboards, not on the news headlines. Those dashboards continue to nearly universally flash a green signal as our well-located properties and excellent service attract our affluent renter demographic in droves, allowing us to retain a record number of our residents and push rents up nearly everywhere we operate. All of this allowed us to increase normalized funds from operations by 13% in the quarter and we expect this growth to accelerate over the next few quarters. As we mentioned in our March operating update, our first quarter same-store revenue results were negatively impacted by an increase in delinquency in Southern California. It appears to us that a relatively small number of Southern California residents, who had previously been good payers, declined to pay rent in order to apply for state rental relief funds. While we remain open to working with residents with true COVID-related hardships, this sort of behavior is not acceptable, and we will continue to work with these residents to obtain our full rental payment. Translating all this into the numbers, first quarter same-store revenue results were about 125 basis points lower than we anticipated due to these higher bad debt, partially offset by about 25 basis points of better rate growth, leaving the final quarterly same-store revenue number about 100 basis points lower than we expected when we gave you guidance back in very early February 2022. Normalized funds from operations in the quarter ended up being about $0.01 lower than we expected with a $0.02 per share or about $6 million hit from higher bad debt, offset by the better rate performance I just mentioned, and the better than expected expense performance that I'll discuss in a moment. As we think about the full year, we feel that we are in a stronger operating position than we had initially contemplated in our full year guidance with a better lease rate growth trajectory more than offsetting our now more cautious view of delinquency. Turning to expenses, our residents appreciate the increasingly seamless digital experience we are providing them, which in turn allows us to have a smaller and more focused property management team. As a result of these efficiencies as well as low property tax expense growth, we're able to deliver 2.5% same-store quarter-over-quarter expense growth in an increasingly inflationary climate. We look forward to continuing to drive innovation and to expanding our operating margins over the balance of the year, while creating remarkable experiences for our customers and for our employees. On the transaction side, as we expected, we did not have much activity in the first quarter. We purchased one asset in San Diego that we discussed in the release and after the quarter end, sold one asset in New York. With that, I'm going to ask Michael to fill you in on the operating details. Go ahead, Michael. Steve, it's Mark. We feel like we're extraordinarily well positioned. I mean, the team would actually tell you we've never been in as good a spot. So we feel really good about that conversation we're going to have with you in July about where the numbers are going to go. But we are entering into the beginning of the leasing season. It's really hard to predict on the bad debt side. We may get more reimbursements, California may slow down. It's just really unpredictable. So the exact place we're going to end up, but do we feel like there's upside to numbers? Absolutely. And Steve it's Mark. Just to build on that. I think very \u2013 already very complete answer. Interest rates right now that two year and 10 year treasury are just back to where they were in early to mid 2019. And I know you know this. We're not at some crazy new interest rate level. And yet our growth prospects are much better now for the industry, for our company than they were in 2019. Now a lot of that's been capitalized into the value of these assets being much higher now than in 2019. But I still think that growth picture, which doesn't have any fractures in it at all for us. And I think for most of the industry is very supportive of values. I'll also add, I think the private market is recognized and I think the public market is increasingly recognizing that apartments are very, very resilient. I mean, this pandemic was about the worst thing that could happen to an urban apartment owner. And yet we're 25 months out of the start of that and we're telling you about how well everything's performing, how well occupied we are again, how we're moving rents up. So I think the combination of the market's perception and the resiliency of the product, especially compared to all the volatility and other investment alternatives combined with just the growth prospects makes us feel pretty good about value going forward. And maybe that exception is if you get into a stagflation environment where the pressures would be a little different, but we feel pretty strongly that values are going to hang in there for us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that question, Chandni it's Mark. What I'd say is that rent control continues to be a conversation, not just in the coastal markets as you implied, but also in places like Florida and other jurisdictions. Because again, as you noted, rents are up significantly. In some of our coastal markets, they're frankly just \u2013 these big increases are frankly just recovering the rents to where they were in 2019. In some places they're significantly higher, like in Southern California. So there's a little bit of that. We have had residents, especially our residents have their incomes continue to rise, which is an offsetting factor. But the biggest thing is we just need to keep as an industry focused and have these conversations with policy makers and in some cases voters about that rent control doesn't work. And we're doing that. The industry is very well organized on these topics. We continue to have these conversations. They're relatively productive. I mean, rent control just \u2013 New York set forms of rent control since World War II and it's the highest cost housing market in the country. I mean, it just doesn't work. And we're continuing to advocate for zoning reforms, continuing to advocate for regulatory reforms, public-private partnerships, like the 485w program in New York that we do hope gets going. So the industry is aware, we acknowledge the problem of a lack of affordable housing in the country. But that problem is a problem that is in some regards of the government's making and we need their cooperation here with some effective policies to improve. So we do see it as a risk. And one of the reasons you see our strategy diversifying is to diversify away from that risk. New York's a great market for us. It's going to have league leading revenue growth. Some of the assets we're selling, we intended to sell well before the pandemic for tax abatement reasons 421a type reasons or ground leases or whatnot, but it is also part of just diversifying into some markets that may be a little less political risk and having a company that can have a little less volatility and compound cash flows more reliably going forward. So we're really excited where we're headed, and this rent control topic does influence our capital allocation. And Nick, just to add, you might remember, we qualify everyone on the basis of their base rent. So they may have gotten a one or two month concession from us, but they can afford to pay that face rent. So they may react to any increase above the face rent, but the disappearance of a one month concession on our financial statements is an 8% increase in revenues, but they've been paying us 11 months' worth of that higher face rent. So for them, there's no change beyond what Michael and his team pushed above face rent. So again, it will look a little different on the financial statements than it will to the resident at hand. And because renewals are so high, the absolute number of people actually moving is really small. I mean when you talk about a percentage, that's one thing, but the 10% or 11% is being applied against a much smaller number of people that are, in fact, leaving us at all for any reason. Yes. And just thinking about cost, I appreciate the point that the sort of FFO yield as compared to interest rates may be lower, but the long-term cost of adding partners, which is effectively what equity is to the company. And when you have all of this, as Bob said, additional debt expansion capability, when you have all this additional availability on the debt side, that seems to us to be dilutive at this point. I don't feel like the stock is trading above our NAV estimates internally. So again, that doesn't seem to us to be the best idea right now relative to just refinancing. And I think Bob and his team have done a good job of giving us a multitude of options. I mean we can go short. It doesn't have to be 10-year debt. Almost 20% of our debt was issued at 30-year maturities and expires in 28 years or more. So we've got the whole curve to use. We have 5% floating rate debt. Maybe we'll float some debt for a little while on the line. So I think we can manage this increase in rates pretty well without having to issue equity that I appreciate might feel cheaper, but to us kind of doesn't. Yes, now, thanks for that question. I think we're really, to your point, kind of in an enviable position in New York. We got great properties and a great team running them, and the assets we're potentially going to sell and have sold have been assets that have had these ground lease accounting issues, have had these 421-a tax reassessment increases that are coming up in the near term that maybe have more intensive renovation plays that maybe aren't our thing to do or we \u2013 aren't things we believe in, but buyers would. So we're keeping the assets that we think are going to drive performance. We're going to have this, and we'll continue to have this amazing New York portfolio that will benefit from, I think, very limited supply from some good job growth. So I think owning New York the next couple of years is going to be great. I think it has to be balanced against these regulatory concerns. So this didn't change our mind on New York. This is something we wish we had sold some of these assets in the past, but the pandemic interfered with that, and we waited for them to recover. And now our investors are going to harvest those gains, and we're going to help with our diversification place to let the company is a little more balanced against some of these regulatory pressures. So \u2013 no, it doesn't make us reassess our position, but I mean we're really pleased on what we own in New York and what we'll own long-term. I think it will be a big driver in the next couple of years. Thank you. Hi, Rich, it's Mark. Last year was a year like no other. So I would say, saying what our behavior is off of last year, we were \u2013 we had \u2013 really challenged trying to figure out guidance. Other folks didn't even bother giving guidance in 2021, and we at least told you where we thought the business was. And then, obviously, the recovery was really vigorous. In 2019 and 2018, we didn't raise at the April mark. So it is kind of our general view here since I've been here in 2007, not to do much in April. And the reason for that is we try to give you a real hard good look when we issued guidance early in February. I mean the other guidance changes really took the numbers to our range. We had the highest range. So again, that was only a couple of months ago and there just isn't enough time in the period. I mean we think we gave you a pretty high-quality estimate. For everyone's portfolio is different, everyone's process is different. But I think we started off with a higher number, so we don't have to adjust it in April. And we're sort of looking at July and going at that point, we'll have a real good sense of where the leasing season is going. We will \u2013 we hope, adjust the guidance ranges appropriately, but it isn't just a matter of you do it, you create guidance ranges so you can definitely raise every quarter, that isn't our goal. Maybe we'll split that up into two pieces. On the operations side, this custom of one year leases is so deep in our business that it's really hard, Rich, for us. I mean in New York, we have to offer two year leases, and we just don't have a lot of uptake on that, and we haven't seen a lot of uptake on that anywhere in the country. So it's an interesting idea, and we've tried that before, and we just have not had a lot of progress on that. So on the operations side, I think all the things we're doing in Michael's world to manage expenses better because this inflationary pressure on payroll is real, and it isn't going to abate. And I think that is part of the 2023 conversation, and that I think it's something we're working really hard on. And we're making good progress, and you can see that in our numbers. So I think as we think about 2023, 2024, 2025, we're thinking we're going to live in an inflationary climate for a while, and we need to adjust to that by managing our people and processes as best we can. On the transaction side, the blessing here is that we're able to do this trade. I would have loved to have done it accretively. It was a little accretive last year, but we're able to switch into these new markets, much newer product, much less capital-intensive product without dilution is a wonderful thing, and we're taking full advantage of that. So the opportunity to sell product that's older product in markets that do have real regulatory challenges that we think a lot of private owners aren't that concerned about because they've got other things on their mind, that's an opportunity from our perspective. And we're selling into that opportunity. Yes, thank you. See you there. We can take the next question, operator. And you got to feel bullish about entertainment in general, how people will consume it has changed. I mean, many of us were older like me consumed it through network television. Now you're consuming it through streaming services and there may be a different way to consume entertainment, but LA as the one of the worldwide centers of the entertainment industry, that's a very powerful economic magnet. And again, even if streaming kind of does withdraw a little bit and maybe there are tighter budgets there, you may have more people going entertainers going direct to the audience, in a TikTok type format and needing production services for those sort of things outside of the streaming industry. So I just think entertainment can be consumed a lot of different ways, but I think LA has a central role and how that's all done. And I think one way or another will benefit from it, even if sort of some of the streaming stuff, these very elaborate productions become a little less. And it's Mark, just to add a little to that, because this is important in the inflationary climate. And we had a lot of \u2013 we've had a lot of good conversations with investors about this point too. Our higher end rent are paying call it 20% of their income to us in rent with a lot of those folks commuting by public transit especially in the East Coast are less susceptible to some of these energy pressures because they are higher earners. They have more disposable income. So even if their energy and food costs are up, they're liable to be pinched less. I think the pressure implied in your question is more likely to incur \u2013 occur, pardon me. In Class B apartment buildings, in apartment properties in more further suburbs maybe in the SFR sector where people are a little more stressed than our renter. Thank you. Yes. And it's Mark, I'm going to add a little to that. Because I think there is another regulatory impact that Michael alluded to there. I mean, in the city of Los Angeles, there is an eviction moratorium. I mean that still exists. There's exceptions to it. There's different actions we can take. I think residents have been diluted into thinking that means they don't have to pay their rent. When in fact, as Michael said, we can do other things to affect their credit and have other more pointed conversations. So I think in some places a moral hazard has been created by these, I think initially well intended, but now well overdue policies. And I think that's part of it. I think the reason you see it a little more in Southern California than in Northern California is because of that. And I think you \u2013 if these programs get extended, I think you're going to see very much more effective legal challenges to them because we're 25 months into the pandemic and all these emergency measures have expired. And the idea that this is the one measure that needs to keep going and that this cost needs to be put on landlords, as opposed to dealing with the housing crisis as a public good, that needs to be dealt with. I don't understand how that's going to work. I think there's going to be pressure on policy makers on that topic. So I think it's a combination of a little moral hazard, a little regulatory mischief, as well as just I think some PR in that market. Our resident base is different. Yes. Our resident base is \u2013 we don't, I mean, this is troubling to us. Sure. But it's not deeply material. We just don't have a lot of evictions. I think we need to just keep having conversations with residents. There's no rent for giving this program at EQR. We will continue to pursue, we'll follow the rules, but we will be persistent. So I guess I'd say that we're going to advocate that these various eviction moratoriums have served their purpose and now should lapse. And we'll continue to have these direct conversations with our residents and a vast majority of them are paying and paying on time and like their service and like their property, but you can't live for free and you need to meet your financial obligations, meet your contractual obligations. And that's something we'll be diligent in following up on. So I guess I'd say to you, I think it is going to get better, and it's probably going to get better slower in LA than anywhere else. Thank you. Thank you all for your time on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you in conferences and in your offices over the next few months. Stay well. Thank you."

            "content": "Sure, Steve. This is Alec. You're right. The market has changed a lot in the last three or four weeks from an interest rate standpoint. But there are countervailing forces at work. There's still all this capital of flowing into our sector. And operating results are still so good. It's a really attractive place for people to put money. And so I would say more that the frostiness is gone, where a month or two ago we had multiple bidders going in and over ask and really bidding the pricing up. And frankly, we didn't buy in that environment, because we thought it got so overheated. So right now it's kind of a feeling out process. But I don't see distress sellers out there. Operations are really strong and there's still as I said, a lot of interest in buying it. So I don't see any fire sales coming and certainly not for us. And when you ask about cost of capital for us, that's really comes from our dispositions. And we expect to continue to be able to sell at low cap rates and redeploy that money non-delusively into our new expansion market. Sure, John. So I would say at this point there's some bidders that are stepping back for sure. They're relying on higher leverage. It's harder for them to make it underwrite. But I can tell you that both what we've been competing to buy and what we've had on the market has seen a lot of interest. And then we see a lot of tours on stuff we've just put on the market recently. And so far haven't seen a dramatic move in pricing. So really can't make a call on that. I would just say there is this feeling out sense that buyers and sellers are just going to determine whether there's a market right now. And at this point, it really feels like there will be, there's just so much capital out there. Yes. That's generally been the case in the market and certainly for the properties that we're looking or thinking about selling. That would be generally the case. Rich, it's Alec. I'll start and others can chime in. But generally, there haven't been that many projects that have stopped at all that I'm aware of, that we see in the market. But everything's gotten harder. So things are taking longer to deliver. So typically about a three month or so lag. So things that are in the pipeline will deliver a little more slowly. In terms of things that are being underwritten right now to generate future supply that's certainly gotten more challenging. It's a combination of costs going up. And costs that were going up say, 0.5% a month are now going up 1% a month. And even things like lumber, which may have abated a little bit are now being offset by steel going up pretty dramatically. So it's a cost challenge on top of which interest rates are up. So all of those things are going to combine to make development a little more challenging to underwrite in the future, we haven't seen that stop anything yet. But if you just look out it does get harder to make the numbers work. Hi, Haendel, this is Alec. The whole market kind of took a pause at the beginning of the year, just because it had been so busy at the end of 2021. And certainly we were part of that. We closed literally five deals in the last two weeks of the year. So the whole market kind of took a break and then it started back up again, really in February. And from our perspective, I alluded to earlier, it was super frothy, really a lot of bidding wars going on, we were part of the process but we didn't feel like it was the time to step in, lean into that. Now the market seems to calm down a little bit. I think there's going to be an opportunity for us to get back on pace. And last year, where we bought \u2013 we sold 1.07 billion and bought a 1.07 billion. We didn't do anything in the first quarter either. So picking up to that pace is certainly our goal and certainly my job to make that happen. And we are pricing very actively right now. Hi, Connor, it's Alec. When you say affordability about \u2013 affordable units on site or are you just saying generally about... Okay. Rent as a percentage of \u2013 no, we're keeping in track generally low 20% rent is a percent of income and as we've talked about in the past, we're really finding the same general kind of renter who's working in the same general knowledge based industries. And has a growing income that supports rent growth over time. So one of the dynamics is that we're growing off of a lower rent base as well so if the average rent is 2500 versus 4,000, we like that spot for a renter who has a good income. Well, this is Alec. I mean, I would say our typical renter is also seeing their income going up pretty aggressively as well. So you see that particularly within the profile that we typically rent to. So that is keeping pace."

            "name": "Bob Garechana",
            "content": "Nick, it's Bob. I'll start with that. So we had about \u2013 we've had concentration of bad debt in Southern California, as you mentioned. And in particular I think Los Angeles and the city of Los Angeles specifically. And if you drill down even a little bit further there's a handful of specific assets where it's even more concentrated. And that was true of most of 2021. It peaked in terms of severity in September of last year and then had pretty stabilized and started to improve slightly in the fourth quarter, which shaped some of our perspective in our guidance. What changed or what happened in the first quarter was you saw a little bit of an uptick in terms of \u2013 as Mark mentioned in the prepared remarks of residents, again, concentrated in those specific areas of about 300 more people that didn't pay. We believe that may have been driven by the fact that they were applying for more rent relief. But they had previously been paying and now they stopped. And so you went from that kind of increase overall. As you go into April and again, it's early and we haven't finished up the month as Michael mentioned. It appears that many of those people are at least starting to pay their April rent. Now what's changed also is that under the rent relief program, you could only have March eligibility. So rent that was through March of 2022 is eligible for the rental relief program. April is not. And so that probably is changing the behavior as well as some other opportunities we have to just communicate with residents, et cetera. Yes. So our bad debt policy in terms of our write-ups is once you get 3 times behind your rent, we would write or reserve against. And we also write-off any debt associated with people who move out. So there's that combination. Also if you were kind of 3 times, but got rent relief, so you weren't the actual payer. We also reserve against that. So it's a pretty conservative policy and looking at kind of what the residents themselves is doing from a payment standpoint. And that policy hasn't changed since kind of the beginning of the pandemic or even prior to that overall. And what was the second part of your question, Nick, other than the policy? Yes. So our initial guidance back in January assumed that we would based on kind of our experience in the fourth quarter, to be honest with you, that I just mentioned thought that we would before rental relief start seeing improvement in the first quarter and then accelerate improvement, meaning more people paying or just moving out as we went through the remainder of the year. What happened based on the first quarter has made us adjust that perspective a little bit and that we still think that we will see the improvement, but it'll probably be less pronounced and it'll be further back in the year. Offsetting some of that change, so more impactful is the number offsetting. Some of that change is we now think we'll probably have higher rental relief, right? So based on what occurred to us. So net-net bad debt is probably going to be flat to maybe marginally helpful to growth between 2021 and 2022. Whereas, previously we had assumed that it would be a contributor to growth. The good news is that everything else that Michael talked about in terms of pricing and everything else relative to guidance is actually more than offsetting that like Mark mentioned. So we feel very good about how we're positioned going into the leasing season. Hi, Nick, it's Bob. There's other pieces associated with it. It's probably about half of the 300 people that didn't pay that we mentioned earlier and the other half is, really we had anticipated improvement based on our fourth quarter experience, and we didn't see any improvement, right. So it's staying flat relative to our expectations that you were going to actually go down and then on top of it, adding these 300 people. So I'll start with the debt maturity real quick and then maybe Mark and I will tag games. So this year, we don't have much debt maturing, John, actually. And then next year, we have the bigger amount of the $1.3 billion or so, some of which is secured and for various structural reasons needs to maintain secured. And then we literally have no debt maturing at all in 2024. So when you look at the profile over the three year time horizon, it's a pretty average to below average kind of maturity profile. And we have lots of flexibility in the markets, at least in the debt markets to refinance, whether that's shorter dated, longer dated, fixed, floating, secured, unsecured, kind of the full access to the capital. Our leverage is also very low relative to kind of targets and other things, and it will be continue to be low, particularly as the recovery and just the overall business performance is great. So \u2013 and maybe I'll let Mark talk a little bit about the equity side. Yes, that would have been a little over 200 basis points better. So something that would have been around, not dissimilar to what the reported Orange County in kind of San Diego were so like 11-ish percent. Yes. And at the overall portfolio, I mean, we're at 19.5% rent as a percent of income. And really when you look at move-ins from the first quarter, the only change that happened was New York that used to be the absolute low point at 17.5% ticked up to 18%, which still shows that from an overall affordability standpoint, those residents are going to be able to absorb additional increases. Yes. So this is Bob. So the shape is actually not changed all that materially, even with the negative impact on the first quarter from bad debt. So the first quarter was always in our mind going to be lower because you're getting this compounding effect of the rent roll, right. You're getting this compounding effect of like putting on these great new lease changes, great renewal rates, great blended piece. And so in our mindset, really Q2 and Q3 are going to be probably the peak above kind of midpoint, a full year guidance range performance from a same-store revenue standpoint that has to do with the comp period, right. And just kind of the comp period trajectory from Q2 and 21, but also just that compounding effect. And we felt like in our original guidance that you would then see more normal seasonality in the fourth quarter as you went into the fourth quarter. And so you'd see a little bit of a dip there. The question will be given where we sit today about how strong the leasing like the lead up to the leasing season is if that normal seasonality returns are not, right. We've had years where we've defied that normal seasonality. The setup, again, sitting here today feels like that normal seasonality might not be as pronounced as what we assumed in our initial guidance. So that feels pretty good. But I think we'll know more in July when we talk to you on the call and we'll be able to give you kind of a robuster view on that."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.\nMarty McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 results and outlook for 2024. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bob Garechana, our CFO. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark J. Parrell: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 results and the outlook for 2024. I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance and 2024 operating expectations, and followed by Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, who'll give some color on our capital allocation activities in the transactions markets. And then finally, Bob Garechana, our CFO, will review our 2024 guidance and our balance sheet, and then we'll take your questions. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance, which was in-line with our October expectations. Our performance in 2023 was supported by a strong employment situation, more than 2.7 million new jobs created. And while the 2024 outlook for overall jobs is more muted, we should benefit from a continued low unemployment rate for the college educated, which currently sits around 2.1%, as well as continued good real wage growth. We will also benefit in 2024 from having low exposure to new supply in the vast majority of our markets, particularly when compared to the Sunbelt markets, as well as the customer comfortably able to pay our rents with current rent income levels at about 20%. Overall, with low unemployment and rising real wages, our target renter demographic remains in good shape. They are likely to rent with us longer as the prospect of homeownership in the near-term seems less likely with scarce inventory and relatively high mortgage rates. Less than 8% of our residents who moved out gave bought home as a reason to depart in 2023, which is the lowest we have seen since we started tracking the number. And over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across our country sets us up for good long-term demand. Drilling down on the West Coast, we do see clear signs of improvement in quality of life and energy on the street in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. We continue to believe a recovery in rental rates in the downtown submarkets of these metros is coming and expect our shareholders will benefit from catch up rental growth in these places, where rents are still at or a fair bit below 2019 levels and where incomes, both on a nominal and real basis, have risen substantially since 2019. So, while we have not baked the material improvement in Seattle and San Francisco performance in our 2024 guidance expectations, we do note that other urban centers damaged by the pandemic and other negative trends, for example, New York City, reignited quickly and sharply off of depressed rent levels once quality of life and employment conditions improved. Switching to the cost side of the equation, our consistent ability to grow expenses and overhead more slowly than our competitors. We'll preserve cash flow for our shareholders as rent growth slows across the country and positions us well once growth picks back up. As it relates to capital allocation, before Alec, goes through the details of our recent transaction activities and our view of forward market conditions, I do want to highlight that we bought back some of our stock in the fourth quarter for the first time in many years. We bought back a little more than 864,000 EQR common shares for a total of about $49 million spent at about $57 per share. We funded this repurchase activity with proceeds from sales during January of less desirable assets that were on average 40 years old and we're sold at a 5.6% disposition yield and believe that at this stock price and funded with these disposition proceeds, buying our shares makes a very good investment, especially given the lack of available assets to acquire at reasonable prices. Before I turn the call over, I want to thank our teams across the company for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and producing strong results for our shareholders. Now I'll turn call over to Michael Manelis.\nMichael L. Manelis: Thanks, Mark. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter 2023 operating performance and our outlook for 2024. We produced same store revenue growth of 3.9% and same store expense growth of only 1.3% in the fourth quarter, both of which were in-line with our expectations. On the expense side, our low growth in the quarter and full-year 4.3% growth were helped by modest property tax cost as well as the savings produced as we continue to roll out initiatives focused on creating operating efficiencies and a seamless customer experience. On the revenue side, the momentum in December was a little better than we thought as sequentially we grew revenue in the fourth quarter by holding onto more occupancy, while maintaining positive blended rate growth. This set us up for a good start in 2024. Demand was solid across our markets and consistent with seasonal expectations. We finished the year with same store physical occupancy at 96% as we focused on building up occupancy in the slower part of our leasing cycle. Today, the portfolio is above 96%. As expected, we saw new lease rates go negative in the quarter as they typically do. Meanwhile, renewal rates for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which was slightly above our expectations. Together, this resulted in a fourth quarter blended rate growth of positive 80 basis points. These healthy fundamentals led to outstanding revenue growth in our East Coast markets and good growth in Southern California. As has been the case all year, the East Coast markets outperform the West Coast and by and large will likely continue to do so in 2024. As you saw in our earnings release, we have provided 2024 same store revenue guidance range of up 2% to 3%. The building blocks for this growth starts with embedded growth of 1.4% and a midpoint assumption that both physical occupancy and cash concessions remain consistent with that of 2023. We expect the year to follow the traditional pre-COVID historical patterns with rent growth sequentially picking up in the spring and likely peaking in August. Our midpoint assumes renewals for the year averaged just over 4%. New lease change is relatively flat, which together produces blended rate growth of about 2%. This is more modest growth than the 2023 full-year blended rate growth of 3.1% and is reflective of a slowing job growth environment offset by a mostly positive supply situation in our coastal market, where we have about 95% of our NOI. As you can see from the stats in the release, January is starting out the way we would expect with new lease change improving, a strong percent of residents renewing, and a renewal rate achieved that is healthy, albeit moderating a bit. While still early, all of these January trends support our outlook for the year, which includes a view that resident retention remains very good, as a result of both the benefits of a centralized renewal process, our enhanced data and analytics insights and the high cost and low availability of owned housing in our markets. Turnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen in the history of our company and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. Orange County, San Diego, Boston, and Washington DC will lead the pack with expected revenue growth of approximately 4%. New York and LA will follow closely behind. At the moment, we expect slightly positive same store revenue growth in San Francisco and Seattle, and in our expansion markets, which reflect only about 5.5% percent of the total company NOI, we expect to produce negative same store revenue growth given the unprecedented levels of supply being delivered. As we look to the individual markets, starting with Boston, with high occupancy and limited new competitive supply. This market should continue to perform well in 2024. The market is supported by a strong employment base and finance, tech, life science, health and education. New supply deliveries will be about the same this year as they were in 2023, and this is a market where our urban assets have outperformed suburban ones lately and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. New York should continue to perform well this year, but won't reach the high rate growth achieved over the last few years. Occupancies remain high and competitive new supply is limited, which led to record high market rents, causing some rate fatigue to be observed in late in '23. New supply deliveries will be similar to last year with very little being delivered in Manhattan, where a large part of our portfolio is located. Washington DC continues to outperform our expectations despite the delivery of a good amount of new supply. The market delivered over 13,000 units in 2023 and saw the great majority of those units absorbed. This year, the market will see a similar amount of deliveries, but demand has been strong and we expect this good performance to continue. We are starting the year with occupancies above 97%, which is a great position to be in. In Los Angeles, we expect the tailwind to growth as we work through the delinquency and bad debt issues that have been concentrated here. We continue to make progress, although the court system remains slow, taking at least six months from our court filing to being able to get the unit back. Bob will give some more color on the impact of bad debt net on our 2024 earnings expectations. New supply deliveries will be slightly higher this year with our Mid-Wilshire Koreatown and San Fernando Valley portfolio seeing the largest impact from this new supply. Strong retention and solid demand will continue to aid our ability to fill vacant units with paying residents in this market. Rounding out Southern California, San Diego, and Orange County should be some of our highest growth markets this year, driven by high occupancies and a general lack of housing. High homeownership costs make renting in these markets a more attractive option. San Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year. In San Francisco and Seattle, we had little to no pricing power throughout 2023 and our base case expectations for this year assume that situation continues. We have seen periods of stability and then pullbacks. Concession use in both markets is widespread. We have strong physical occupancy with both markets being above 96%, which tells us there is demand, although it is very price sensitive. As Mark mentioned, the downtown areas of both markets continue to see improvement in the quality of life, but are still lacking the catalyst of return to office and or job growth. New supply in San Francisco this year will be up from last year levels, mostly due to an increase in the South Bay, although continued healthy demand in this submarket should aid the absorption. Seattle is likely to be the most impacted of any of our markets when it comes to new supply deliveries with increases in both the City of Seattle and the Eastside. The lack of expected job growth combined with this new supply has driven our low expectations in Seattle for 2024. Both Seattle and San Francisco continue to see less than normal inbound migration. Seattle in the fourth quarter, however, did see some relative improvement with new residents coming to us from out of state. This positive trend is something that we will keep an eye on as we move through the spring leasing season. Drawing new residents back to the MSAs in both Seattle and San Francisco would be a catalyst for these markets to outperform our expectations. In the expansion markets, our long-term outlook remained positive. That said, high levels of new supply are already pressuring rents and is likely to continue throughout 2024. At present, we are operating from a defensive position and starting the year with occupancies that are two to three percentage points above the market averages. Denver has demonstrated the most stability despite having limited pricing power in the portfolio, and we expect the market to produce slightly positive same store revenue growth in 2024. Currently, Atlanta is using the least demonic concessions, but we expect a few of our assets to be very challenged due to the sheer number of lease ups in close proximity, which will likely lead to negative revenue growth for the year. In Texas, Dallas and Austin have widespread concession use, and we expect all of our assets to experience direct pressure from new deliveries all year long, resulting in negative same store revenue growth in these markets. So, putting all of these factors together, our overall same store revenue outlook for 2024, right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets and Southern California, which collectively is almost 70% of our NOI. We expect our coastal existing markets to outperform our expansion markets where unprecedented supply will impact operations near-term. On the initiative side, in 2024, we will continue to focus on producing operating efficiencies and driving other income with projects tied to flexible living options, parking, renter's insurance, and monetizing technology deployed for the benefits of our residents. We are almost complete with the rollout of smart home technology across our portfolio, which will create further opportunities to share teams across properties and enable additional self-service options for residents. This, along with other ancillary income, should lead to total other income growth of 30 basis points excluding bad debt. As we sit here today, we like our positioning and look forward to capturing the opportunities the spring leasing season brings, which will help frame pricing power for the full year. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results. With that, I will turn the call over to Alec, to walk through our capital allocation activities and the transaction market.\nAlexander Brackenridge: Thank you, Michael. Despite an unsettled transactions market, we remain steadfast in our efforts to continue to reposition our portfolio by increasing our presence in markets like Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Austin and Denver and expect to see more opportunities to do so as the year progresses. As we underwrite potential acquisitions, we are always mindful of heightened levels of supply pressuring rents in our expansion markets and reflect tempered rent growth and concessions as needed in our projections. Currently, the transaction market remains unusually choppy with volumes down 60% to 70% compared to 2022 and down 40% to 50% compared to a more typical year like 2019. Nonetheless pressures on sellers to transact continue to mount as does the volume of new developments being delivered in these markets. New developments in particular are often not capitalized to be held for the long-term, and even with rates decreasing over the last few months, carry costs are high. Owners of stabilized assets will also see pressure to transact, as loans mature and extensions that were agreed to with lenders last year expire. Despite the short-term operating challenges in our expansion markets, we remain committed to broadening our footprint in markets that will see strong job growth and household formations over time and lower regulatory risks. As regards our own transactions activity, we didn't acquire any assets in the fourth quarter, but we did sell three, a small property in Seattle, one in the Bay area and one in LA. On average, the properties were 40 years old and total sales proceeds were $185 million at an average 5.8% disposition yield. While transaction volume overall is very light, we are seeing some opportunities to lighten the load of non-core older assets primarily in our West Coast markets. Since the beginning of 2024, we've sold two additional properties, one in Southern California and a small deal in Boston for a total of $189 million at an average 5.6% disposition yield. We've allocated a portion of the capital from these sales to the share buyback activity Mark just mentioned. With ample access to capital either through asset sales or debt issuance and a property management presence in our expansion markets, we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. In terms of anticipated volume, our guidance for 2024 is $1 billion for both acquisitions and dispositions, but market conditions will dictate whether we can hit or even exceed these goals. Turning to development, in 2024, will complete six new apartment properties with a total cost expected to be $624 million and consisting of 1,982 units with lease ups commencing for two of those projects in Q1 and four in Q2. Three of those lease ups all through our joint venture program with Toll Brothers are in Dallas, while the remaining three, two in Denver and one in suburban New York City are JVs with other developers. Given the timing for completion and lease up, we don't expect meaningful contribution to NFFO growth in 2024, but would expect these projects to contribute more to 2025 growth. While our suburban New York project will see limited competition from new supply, not unexpectedly our lease ups in Dallas and Denver will see substantial new competition. We acknowledge that the competition may be challenging and anticipate as we may have to adjust pricing and concessions to meet the market, our projected stabilized yields, which at initial underwriting were on average a mid six maybe closer to six. We believe these lease ups once stabilized and past the current supply glut will provide good cash flow growth and be solid long-term investments. Beyond these deliveries, we will be very selective about starting any new projects with a primary focus on locations where it's hard to buy such as suburban Boston. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert A. Garechana: Thanks, Alec. As Michael and Mark mentioned, 2023 ended up right in-line with our forecast last quarter. So, let's get right to guidance. Michael gave you most of the building blocks for same store revenue, but I'll finish up with bad debt, walk through drivers of same store expenses and normalized FFO and conclude with the balance sheet. In 2023, we were able to reduce bad debt significantly once the regulatory environment became more constructive. While we continue to work with non-paying residents, as we have during and after the pandemic, ultimately, we still ended up processing a high volume of skips and evicts. In fact, about 1.5 times pre-pandemic activity levels, which coupled with not adding significant amounts of new non-paying residents, helped us reduce bad debt as a percentage of same store revenue from well over 2% to just under 1.5%. So, great progress overall, but still a long way from the 50 basis points we were accustomed to pre-pandemic. Much like last year, we expect 2024 to continue to show improvement. We also expect the pace of this improvement to be dependent on the speed of the court systems, primarily in Southern California, where delinquency remains highest, to quickly process evictions, which is a hard thing to predict. As a result, our guidance assumes that 2024 remains another transition year for bad debt and that we don't get all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, our guidance midpoint assumes that full-year bad debt as a percentage of same store residential revenue is slightly above 1% or a 30 basis point contribution to 2024 growth overall. If that plays out, by the end of 2024, we would expect to be a little under two times pre-pandemic levels. Turning to expenses. Expense management is core strength at Equity Residential as evidenced by the historical performance Mark referenced. Our same store expense guidance of 4% is also reflective of that discipline. This year, the individual drivers of growth are a little different than those from 2023. So, let me give you a high level assessment, and we can get into more detail in Q&A if required. In 2024, we expect real estate taxes and utilities to grow faster than they did in 2023, in part due to some 421-A step ups and commodity prices, while payroll and repairs and maintenance should be slower due to various initiatives and an expected normalization of inflationary pressures. Insurance, a small category at less than 5% of total expenses, but a topic often discussed should grow more slowly than last year, but remain above the long-term trend with growth in the low-double-digits. Turning to normalized FFO, Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. As is typical, same store NOI performance is the primary driver of growth, but let me provide some color on transaction activity. We are assuming $1 billion in both acquisitions and dispositions for 2024 with limited dilution, yet we show a $0.03 reduction in normalized FFO growth there. This is due to our assumption that our acquisition activity mostly occurs later in the year than our dispositions. This is also partially offset in interest expense and interest income as disposition proceeds are used to pay down debt or invested in interest bearing 1031 accounts while we await acquisitions. Now a very brief comment on the balance sheet, because we're in really great shape here. We have no debt maturities until the middle of 2025, modest outstanding balances on our commercial paper program and less than 10% floating rate debt. So, we're very well-positioned. In fact, over 50% of our existing debt doesn't mature until after 2030. The work we've done over the last number of years has reduced our interest rate exposure and allows us for ample debt capacity to run and grow our business. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, wanted to just maybe go through some of the building blocks of growth in 2024 either for Michael or Bob. But as you kind of look through the moving pieces here. It seemed like maybe the new rate growth that kind of flattish might be one that could pose maybe a bit more of a challenge here of job growth slow. So, just curious how you sort of sized all up those components and how did you think about the new lease component with the fact that you kept occupancy flat, I guess, within the guidance?\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Steve. This is, Michael. I'll start. Maybe Bob can come over the top. So, I think when you look at the building blocks for the guidance, you need to realize, one, we're giving you a range, and there's a lot of different ways you can get there, but it's really the top level themes that underline and pin those midpoint assumptions. So, when we thought about new lease change, we started with the fact that we know the job growth is moderating this year, and, therefore, we would expect market rents or asking rents just to be kind of less than normal across the large majority of our markets. So we kind of model a normal seasonal slope for our kind of rent trend to build, and then we plug that in and we say, okay, what does that equate to? And right now, across our market, it's balancing out to basically be about flat on new lease change for the full year. Some of our markets are still positive. Some of our markets are still positive three, and some of the markets are still coming in at a negative growth through the year. But I think when you start to pull on any one of those, you need to go back to the top level themes and ask yourself, okay, what's really changing? So, if there's a material shift in job growth, sure. I think we would experience more pressure than we underlined in that the midpoint of our range. But again, it's, when does that happen in the year? And where are we? Because today, I'll tell you, we have taking a defensive position. We're starting the year with pretty strong occupancy that really gives us some confidence heading into the spring leasing season, and we'll just see kind of what pricing power emerges from that.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then just maybe one question on the transaction market. I know it's not been terribly, robust, but maybe, Alec, can you just speak to where you think maybe IRR hurdles are today that the 10 year is sort of plus or minus 4% come down way off the high. I realize NOI and rent growth is slowing, but where do you think investment hurdles are today either for EQR or for the market broadly speaking?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Hi, Steve, it's Alec. Thanks for the question. Well, as you stated, it's a pretty choppy market right now and there aren't a whole lot of data points. As you know, the NMHC, conference is going on in San Diego right now. So, I have some pretty current time information, which is really a reiteration of what we've been experiencing in the last few months, which is a standoff between buyers and sellers. Buyers generally looking for a 5.5ish cap and sellers generally looking for something closer to five. So, not an insurmountable gap at some point, but right now, it's hard to peg things. But, assuming things kind of land somewhere in between there at a 5.25. I think most people are shooting for an 8ish IRR and obviously it depends on the rent growth assumptions and the residual cap rate, but somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit less if they're going to be more aggressive.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That's it for me.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Eric Wolfe from Citi. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: Thanks. It's Nick here with Eric. Maybe just following up on that. So 8ish or so IRR, I guess, more specifically you talked about obviously the Sunbelt supply and the impact that has on your underwriting on those deals at least initially. So, when you're underwriting deals both on the buy and sell side today, what are you underwriting for IRRs in the Sunbelt? And then what are the IRRs look like for the assets you're planning to sell more coastal.\nAlexander Brackenridge: So, Eric I'm sorry. It's not Eric.\nUnidentified Participant: It's Nick.\nAlexander Brackenridge: Nick. Sorry, Nick. It's Alec. And, the IRRs don't end up being that different, if you assume that, sure, there's a glut of apartments in the Sunbelt right now, so the next couple of years are going to be tough. But after that, the start's already down a lot. The demand story hasn't changed. I think there's still these cities that we're interested in that some of which are Sunbelt cities, like Dallas, like Atlanta, like Denver and Austin, still our great job growth generators, still have a lot great long-term demand side story. So, I think you see a couple of years that are tough, but then you have a pretty good few years after that. And I think you run that through your pro-forma and you're roughly the same. The difference we're seeing on a lot of things that we're selling right now and why the IRR for us is lower in terms of the hold scenario and why we choose to sell it is a lot of older stuff. You saw that, we're selling 40 years old property and that have very high capital needs. And some of that has our ROI on it. Some of it, it's just preserving the asset. And, there may be a buyer that sees things differently, sees a little more upside. But in our case, we think the capital is better used elsewhere. So, in our eyes, it's probably a 7ish something or other, and we think that money can be redeployed better elsewhere.\nEric Wolfe: Hi. It's Eric. Sorry to keep switching people on you. But, maybe just talking about coastal rent growth for a second. You talked about supply being in check, homeownership, very unaffordable, solid real wage growth, job growth, okay, maybe getting a little slower. But I guess the question is why aren't we seeing stronger rent growth today just given all of those positive dynamics? And is there anything that do you think in the future would turn it around such you see that sort of more than 3% type rent growth in those coastal markets.\nMark J. Parrell: Hi, Eric, it's Mark. Just to start, the others can contribute. I mean, you look at the numbers in DC and Boston and New York last year were outstanding. So, we're being thoughtful. We're being a little cautious going into a volatile year, but your restatement of the setup is correct. I mean, those northeast markets have steady demand, by and large, minimal supply or in DC's case, strong absorption characteristics. I mean, we're optimistic those markets can continue to do well. In some cases, like New York, and Michael alluded to that, they're coming off really big rent growth years. In some cases, there's a little bit of a pause to catch your breath and let resident incomes grow to catch up to rental growth. But, I mean, if you didn't get that message, we're super optimistic about the northeast markets and think they will do very well. It's just trying to handicap all the various crosscurrents in the economy that are challenging for us.\nEric Wolfe: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. My first question is a follow-up. I heard a comment and I think it was on the Sunbelt quote it could be a couple tough years. I guess can you expand on that? And then, and maybe most important is talk about when you expect supply pressure to peak, let's say, in Seattle. And I know, again, Sunbelt is, smaller markets for you. But if you have a view on the Sunbelt, it would be appreciated? Thank you.\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. Hey, Jeff. This is Michael. So I'll start. And just specific to the Seattle and the supply that we see, it is back half loaded for us in the market with basically, a lot of concentration in Redmond as well as the city of Seattle. So for us, like, the peak is what we expect to experience is going to be somewhere in that back half of this year. And you could already see the starts coming way down. So, I think the level of competitive pressure that we face in \u201825 and Seattle will be less than what we're facing in \u201824. Relative to the Sunbelts, I mean, this is a great question because it's going to take a while to absorb the units that are coming to this market, and the supply that we look at is fairly constant across many of the Sunbelt markets all year long by quarter, which tells us that and what I said in the prepared remarks that we expect to feel this pressure at our assets all year long. I think as you turn the corner and you get into \u201825, you're going to start to see that supply number slow down, but you are still going to have a little bit of the overhang of the pressure from the units that were delivered to the market in \u201824.\nMark J. Parrell: Yes. I'm just going to add a little bit to that. If you look at \u201825 expected deliveries and some stuff from \u201824 will definitely slip, I mean, it's about as big as \u201823\u2019s delivery. So, it's not like \u201825 is a, incredible decline. So, what we really see, Jeff, as we look at this is still good demand in those markets. That's why we like Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver, Austin and Atlanta. But the supply picture in our experience, we'll spend this whole year with declining new lease rates, occupancy pressure, all of those things, and you as an investor and an analyst may start to see improvement in that so called second derivative of rent growth late this year beginning of \u201825. But same store revenue growth in our experience will be worse in \u201825, not in \u201824 because all those leases that are being rewritten will go through the rent roll. And so you may be more optimistic in \u201825, but your numbers actually likely will be worse. So, that's what we've seen with supply in our history across our markets, and then we don't really see why it'd be any different here. And I think the wild card is if you have incredible job growth in these markets, you may be able to absorb some of this supply more efficiently and get through it more quickly. But the idea that \u201824 is the only oversupplied year is kind of a tough one for us to accept.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. That's very helpful. And is that why you're assuming acquisitions in the second half or is that just conservative approach I guess to the guidance on acquisitions or to your point, are you really expecting these opportunities to arise more second half \u201825 in your expansion markets?\nMark J. Parrell: Well, the guidance is just to help you model. If Alec, can buy things in his team earlier at good prices, we'll buy them earlier. The relationship I think you're going to see here is that prices now seem okay, maybe not quite good enough, but the discount to basis, the replacement cost, pardon me, is very good. It's the cap rate. And when you look at, like, two years of declining rental growth, you buy in Dallas, your year two number might be lower your cap rate than your year one. But on the other hand, later this year, you'll be past some of that and your year two number will look a little better. So, likely paying a higher price. So, that's what you're going to see us navigate. We like these markets long-term. We think owning the four markets that we've, tabbed as our expansion markets, say, 25% of the company will create more balance and drive growth better and reduce volatility over time, Jeff. But getting into them is a little bit of an art. There's going to be a little bit that we probably do sooner, a little bit we do later, and you may feel better about the price in one and not as good about the revenue growth in the other and vice versa. But, we're prepared to do that. And, again, the number you see there is just sort of the guidance assumption. We'd be happy to do more if we can find more.\nJeff Spector: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Robin Lu from Green Street. Please go ahead.\nRobin Lu: Good morning. I just want to touch on taxes. From your conversations with cities, are you hearing any markets where lower values are starting to flow through to tax assessments?\nRobert A. Garechana: Yes. Hi, Robin. It's Bob. Thanks for the question. We are seeing lower values in some markets. In fact, we've gotten some assessed values, actually back already, as we look at 2024. And on the margin, you are seeing some decreases. So for instance, in Washington state, we saw about a 1% decrease, and we've got most of the values back there, and we're seeing it in other places. Obviously the income, as assessors look at values, the income production in 2023 was really quite good. But the offset there was really the cap rate change just given risk free rates and other things. And so we are seeing some acknowledgment by assessors that values are in fact, lower than what they had initially assessed at. The open item as you think about real estate taxes for 2024 will be where rate comes. And we have rates in some places, and we'll see where they, fall out in others.\nRobin Lu: So, the magnitude of where values have fallen in, let's call it, the last couple of years haven't really fully been baked in yet. They're still sort of trickling into tax assessment. Is that how -- am I interpreting that correctly?\nRobert A. Garechana: You are correct, and that makes for an excellent appeal activity for our real estate tax team as we challenge values.\nRobin Lu: I'm glad it could help. Just on the second question.\nRobert A. Garechana: Thanks.\nRobin Lu: I did obviously notice that you, did some stock repurchases in the open market after a long period of a pause, with, I guess, little less system development and no near-term debt maturity, are you expecting or how does buybacks drive against other capital, uses this year, particularly on the way that you, the cadence between disposition and acquisitions for 2024?\nMark J. Parrell: Hi, Robin, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. Our primary capital allocation goal is going to remain building out the portfolio in the way I just described in these expansion markets and lowering exposure in Washington DC, New York, and California. Again, we believe that portfolio will create the highest returns over time, the lowest volatility, that that'll make the shareholders the most money in the long haul. All that said, we're going to continue to consider these share buybacks, especially when you get this bigger value dislocation and when you can fund it with assets that are the least desirable, among the least desirable in the portfolio against the portfolio that we think is really top notch and where there isn't a lot to buy. That's an important other ingredient. There wasn't a lot of opportunity cost here, there wasn't a lot else available to buy at prices that made sense and all those capital structure considerations have to be thought about too. We've talked about on these calls. Things like, does it create a lot of tax gain that's hard for a REIT to manage. That worked out okay for us. Bob has done a great job and his team on the balance sheet, so I don't have to worry about debt maturities that we need to kind of husband our capital. And another I want to introduce is you got to be careful about platform scaling. If you sell too many assets, you can really increase your overhead as a percentage of revenue. But all that said, the Board and the management team remain open to buybacks. And for us, it's hard for me to give you a formula. We're just going to kind of see what market conditions are, where the stock goes, what's out there to buy, and, keep our mind open to doing more, stock buybacks.\nRobin Lu: Right. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question kind of dovetails off of Jeff's one. If you kind of slice your portfolio between kind of core coastal, San Francisco and Seattle and then expansion markets, you talked quite a bit about just when you're expected to see the second derivative and basically how long it's going to take for the expansion markets to recover. Can you put some more context around San Francisco and Seattle, how that timeline compares? And if you're starting to see some of that second derivative recovery, now or expect to see it in the near future? Thanks.\nMark J. Parrell: Hi, Michael, it's Mark, and I think, Michael Manelis may have something to add here. So, we talked a lot about San Francisco on the call, the last one and why we like the market long-term, feel the same way. The management team thinks there's going to be elongated recovery in that market. Conditions on the ground are a lot better. The mayor put out some information about crime reductions. They have the biggest class of police cadets, at the police academy in San Francisco, they've had since before the pandemic. So, there's some good things going on. But until, as Michael said, we get a little more tech job growth, which talking to the team and talking to others in the Bay area and in the city of San Francisco is probably a more later \u201824, \u201825 thing. That's probably where you get rent to take off. The thing I want you to think about is, you've had spectacular growth in incomes in the Bay area since 2019, over 30% nominal and 12% or 13% on a real basis, yet our rents are down in the city of San Francisco 20% since 2019 and kind of flattish to up marginally in the Bay area. So, this is a market that, like New York, can really take off once you get some job growth, because there isn't a lot of new supply. Housing costs are pretty high. So, the management team's optimistic about the recovery. The timing is kind of tough. I don't know, Michael, if you've got anything you want to add.\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. I mean, I think we expect these markets to be volatile this year. And just starting off the year right now, I got both markets at 96%. Yes, we issued a lot of concessions in fourth quarter to get there, but the fact that we got there shows us there is demand in the marketplace. And as we think about even, like, the new lease change. So, both of those markets reported in December about a negative 8% new lease change. When you look at the January results, they're now both at about a negative 3.5%. So, it's a pretty material shift. So, the setup heading into the spring leasing season is really good, but we've been there before, and we've seen those markets kind of hit a pause and then kind of retrench a little bit. So, that's why we're just being a little cautious. We're going to wait till we see probably a couple consecutive quarters of improving fundamentals before we kind of change some of our long-term modeling on those markets. The other thing I would just add besides the value proposition of San Francisco is Seattle benefits from having, like, the lowest rent to income ratios out of all of our coastal markets. So, we just see this opportunity and the fundamentals for those markets to recover. It's just like Mark said, it's hard to pinpoint when.\nMark J. Parrell: Yes. I forgot to mention something on Seattle I just want to throw out there. Seattle's nominal wage growth since 2019 is 40%, right. Yet our rents in that market are up 7%, and downtown, they're flat. So, again, these markets have the ability to pay more for great quality housing. And, again, Seattle is a supply, push this year, but after that, it gets a lot lighter. So, that's about a third of our portfolio, Seattle and San Francisco. And I hope, Michael, we're talking about that second derivative towards the end of this year for you, but we haven't embedded that into our guidance.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. Very helpful guys. And then my second question is just related to bad debt as a percentage of revenue, it was flat sequentially. I think there's an expectation that it could be choppy, but continue to trend down. So, what's assumed in guidance for 2024? And do you expect a continued slow and steady pace of improvement? Or should we expect that to kind of to get better in a specific quarter or just any sort of visibility around the pacing of improvement? Thank you.\nRobert A. Garechana: Yes. I'll grab that, Michael. It's Bob. So, to start with what's assumed in guidance, we do assume that we will get, we will improve. So, we ended the year at, call it, 1.4% of bad debt as a percentage of same store revenue. I think I said in my remarks, we expect to get to 1% a little over 1% for the full year. That means that by the fourth quarter, we're assuming that we're sub, 1%. You're correct in the kind of 3Q to 4Q in 2023 it being flattish, and what I would caution and is that it is, this is a thing that is very hard predict because of the court systems. It has puts and takes. There's more of a step function than a linear kind of improvement function associated with it. So, our expectations and guidance is that, Q1, which we're in right now is more flattish, and that you started see seeing improvement later in Q2, Q3, and Q4, because of that kind of case of the court system and because there is there's always been a little bit of seasonality in this number as you think about, like, post holidays, bad debt in the first quarter is always or typically a little bit higher anyways. So, expect it a little bit of a choppy step function, but expect improvement overall.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you, and, thanks for taking the question. So, I guess just thinking about your comments on Sunbelt versus coastal, you think about the assets you bought, last quarter, one year old, selling assets that are 40 years old. How much of your view on those markets is, tied to just the types of assets you own? At least if they're newer assets, are they in lease up where you meet, it means you have more concessions, more challenging to get, to get leased up. Is there some of that bias in the numbers you're putting out, or would you say, your view of what you're seeing in coastal is truly, a view across the markets?\nMark J. Parrell: Yes. Thanks for that question, Jamie. I guess I attack it another way by certainly lease ups are different. But remember, the numbers we're telling you are same store numbers, so they won't include lease up conversations. But I would say we have relatively small portfolios in those markets. So, if one property is being hit hard, it could be one out of eight of our same store assets in, Denver. So, I think that is it. I think different people, obviously, different parts of the market feel it differently. So, that would be my comment. We have relatively small portfolios. I mean, Austin, we have three same store assets.\nAlexander Brackenridge: So, and, Jamie, this is Alec. I would just add, though. When you're in a market, though, that's got so much supply, and these are historic amounts, where concession levels start to get more than two months or, really excessive, I think everyone gets impacted, whether you're a B property or an A property. I can't see how you're immune, from some of that pressure.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That's very helpful. And then as we think about the investment market, I mean, clearly, the debt markets are coming back, pretty quickly. We've now seen some real estate M&A. So, I assume competition is going to get harder for the types of assets you'd like acquire in \u201824 and beyond. How do you think about the importance of just transitioning the portfolio, as soon as you can versus, really hitting that right number? Do you think maybe your underwriting assumptions have to loosen up a little bit just so you can achieve some of your strategic goals, over the next couple of years if the market gets more competitive.\nMark J. Parrell: We'd love to move more quickly in completing our, repositioning. I don't feel any need to do that by selling assets cheap. I think you'll continue to see us, sell assets that are a little bit less desirable from our point of view. It's more about the difference, Jamie, between the sale and the buy, if we can sell things well, we can pay up a little bit on the buy side. And, again, we're creating that diversification we value. So, it's a little bit about if we're doing trading like that, it's going to depend on both the sale price and the buy price. To the extent we try and expand the company through debt activities, then the interest rate that Bob's borrowing at is going to become more relevant. So, I think right now would be somewhere in the name of where the 5% for 10 year money. So, I hope that's helpful, but we'd like to move faster. We point out that since 2019, when we started this, we've moved billions of dollars of capital into those markets, but the transaction markets have been closed for half of the last four and a half years because of COVID and because of the Fed. So, we're hopeful that in a wide open year, I mean, we did, I think, $1.7 billion back in \u201822. We're capable of doing $2 billion plus a year for sure. If the opportunities present themselves and we push the gas hard, it's got to make some sense. De minimis dilution is one thing. Wholesale dilution would require some sort of justification that, we could get on this call and you all would feel was compelling.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. So, it sounds like it's more about the dilution than it is the absolute cap rate or the absolute IRR?\nMark J. Parrell: We would accept some dilution to complete our strategic repositioning. The IRR matters. I mean, these deals got to make sense. We like owning newer assets because we'll have less capital. At the end of the day, the portfolios we'll own in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, and Austin. We'll be the youngest portfolios of our REIT competitors. We think that's beneficial to our shareholders on the IRR CapEx side, not just on the NOI side. So, yes, we want to push the gas on this. We want to move this along. The IRR matters. The cap rate matters, dilution matters, but, getting it done matters a lot.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Brad Heffern from RBC. Please go ahead.\nBrad Heffern: Yes. Hi, everybody. In the prepared comments, you mentioned some increased price sensitivity in New York late in the year. Can you add some color on that and talk about what gives you confidence to rank that market relatively high for 2024?\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Brad. This is Michael. So, I think in the prepared remarks, I was saying we saw just that the overall market level, there was what I would describe as just like rent fatigue where you started to see, certain types of units, one bedrooms, all of a sudden hit a price point at, like, $4,000. And it just kind of the activity level slowed. The renewal conversations became a little bit, more challenging. So, I would say we still expect pretty good growth out of New York in 2024. We're just saying we're tempering those expectations a little bit. The fundamentals there would all suggest that you have pretty good pricing power all year long because you have almost little to no competitive supply in Manhattan. You've got good demand drivers, in those markets, but I just think we're realistic that we've had two really good years of rent growth of rate growth that we're just kind of saying, okay. Let's just take a pause on that, and let's wait till the spring leasing season shows us, exactly what the market's willing to absorb.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And as a follow on to your earlier comments about wage growth on the West Coast versus where rent has gone. I guess, how much of that opens up an opportunity for future rent growth versus how much of that just reflects that those markets have become unaffordable before the downturn, and they've been, semi-permanently reprised?\nMark J. Parrell: I guess we'll see. I our sense, again, from all our comments on San Francisco and Seattle is that they still are appealing places for our demographic to live that people will want to live in the center of those cities and the whole market and that, I don't know about some sort of wholesale repricing. And you saw New York recovered smartly on the rent side, and there's some deals going on in the investment sales market that would support New York trading at a lower cap rate as it historically has than the national average. So, I think the story is yet to be told on the West Coast markets because there's just no one selling, in the urban centers. But, I don't think, there's an answer to that, but I think the appeal of those centers is true and obvious and will come, and we've kind of given you our view of that.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes. Hi, good morning. So, two questions here. First, on the renewals, in addition to jobs, I guess renewals also seem to be a wild card. I realize there's a frictional cost to moving, especially in urban assets, but can you just walk through your views on renewal activity for this year. And it seems that you guys think it will hold up much better than new rents. And I'm sort of curious, I would think those same existing residents would see the new rates that, newcomers are getting in would want a rent reduction, not a rent increase?\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes, Alex. This is Michael. So, yes, I think it's a great question. And what I could tell you right now is that the quotes for the next 90 days have already been issued. We do expect to continue to renew about 55% to 60% of our residents, and achieve approximately anywhere between a 4% and 4.5% growth off of about 6% quotes that are out in the marketplace. You got to remember in the last couple of years, I mean, we put a lot of effort into this renewal process. We've centralized our renewal negotiations. That's really helped us navigate, the negotiation conversations with residents. We're leveraging all new processes in both the quote generation as well as the negotiations. We're layering in data science to help enhance some of these results. And right now, we do expect renewal performance to be fairly stable, but we have modeled for further deceleration, like, later in the year. So, the full year is expected to come in just over 4%, which is still a pretty solid growth, but we do expect to see some deceleration. And I think when you look at the spreads right now that you see in the markets with new lease change or market pricing and renewals. Sure, there's more stickiness when it comes to the renewals, and we have a lot of great rich history and data going all the way back to, like, 2006. That shows us that even when markets are dislocating, and I could use a San Francisco back in, like, 2016 where it was just getting a lot of new supply right on top of us. That market held up pretty well from the renewal standpoint and landed somewhere in that back half of the year with about 2% averages. So, it's not uncommon to see these spreads in the marketplaces. And the other thing, I guess, I would point out is we start getting into \u201824, our concession use was elevated back in \u201823. So, I can renew a lot of these residents flat in some of these expansion markets or Seattle and San Francisco and still walk away with a 6%, 8% increase on renewal. So, it kind of takes away some of the spread that you're looking at and why we have so much but in that renewal number being right around 4%.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question sort of dovetails on the rent fatigue comments. It seems, I mean, using New York as an example, no new supply, people want to be back in the city, and we don't really hear stories anymore about doubling up or even moving to New Jersey is still an expensive proposition. So, from a pricing perspective, do you feel more comfortable today sort of across your portfolio, especially in markets like New York, in pushing pricing versus years ago when renters and I'm not just talking about new supply, but we're doubling up or maybe moving to New Jersey or outer boroughs or something was more of an option. Do you feel like you have more pricing power today to push rents more than historically?\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. Alex, this is Michael. I'll start. Maybe somebody can layer on top of that. I think this is really a market and submarket kind of look. So, it really just depends as what is the spread, how much is Brooklyn's rent compared to Manhattan, what is that trade-off, decision to happen. So, I don't know that I'd say I have more pricing power today than I have had historically. I would say we have really good processes in place today that help us navigate through these situations. And each market is going to deliver different rate growth based on a whole lot of factors that go into the strengths of markets. And as we look for, 2024, all I can say is that the setup feels pretty good. Yes, it's like normal. The rents are doing what they seasonally should be doing, sequentially building each week. Our application volume is sequentially building each week. I think we need to see that momentum in that early part of the spring leasing season to really be able to answer that question and tell you, do I feel like I got more pricing power or less than historical times.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Rich Anderson from Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, on the topic of expansion markets, is it absolutely a fee simple type of investment? Or would you be open, given the sort of the complexity of all the lending environment and all that sort of stuff and some and distress balance sheet distress and whatnot. Would you be willing to invest, in different areas of the capital stack and with an intention to ultimately own? Or are you going to have enough opportunity to keep it simple and just go, through equity channels.\nAlexander Brackenridge: Hi, Rich. It's Alec. Well, we prefer simple if it's available, but if there's a good opportunity that would require us to participate elsewhere in the capital stack that would lead to us likely owning the property, we're wide open for that as well. So, I do think there's going to be a lot of fee simple stuff out there, though. So, we'll balance that out, but we're happy to talk to anyone that owns a while located apartment in the expansion markets, about any structures they have.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Great. And then, if I could just sort of, ask the sort of a different question about, what you said, Mark, earlier about 2025 being a tougher year in the Sunbelt versus 2024. But then you said something like, but the second derivative might be thought to be better. I didn't quite understand that. So, maybe you can clarify that. But would you say, generally speaking that the Sunbelt sort of recovery process is maybe a year behind San Francisco and Seattle? Is that, like, does that sort of help define the condition that you see it today?\nMark J. Parrell: Yes. Well, I'm going to say is just how we've seen things play out in our market. So, the first thing that you see is you start to see a decline in occupancy when you get all of this, when you get a lot supply or big demand drop or both. So, the markets you've seen competitors in the RealPage numbers sort of show declines in occupancy. That pressures owners to give concessions and lower face rate, and then that in turn eventually affects same store revenue, which is, of course, the interplay between occupancy rate, renewals, and the whole nine yards. And so, in when it reverses, the exact opposite happens. First, you start to see, I'm building my occupancy a little. As Michael spoke to Seattle and San Francisco, that gives you a little bit of confidence. So, now you're going to take away of your concessions, you're going to try to move rate up a little, especially in the spring leasing season, you're going to test that as that improves, and, eventually, that'll flow through to your same store revenue number. So, that's what I mean by that comment. So that this year, same store revenue might hold up better in a heavily supplied market or a demand challenged market because you're looking at a situation where your rents, you haven't rewritten every lease down yet.\nRich Anderson: Right.\nMark J. Parrell: But over the course of two years, you will. And in that process, that second year same store revenue number is often lower, But we're often telling you, hey, you know what? New lease is going up. We're feeling better in a market. And that's what I'm sort of expecting. We'll see how it goes, but my expectation is sometime in \u201825, folks will be talking about an improvement in some of those, I call it second derivative, but new lease rates, street rent numbers, and it isn't going to be dramatic right away, but it's sort of some solidification of that that's really built on occupancy starting to improve. So, again, you got all this supply. Our experience is it compounds. It gets worse before it gets better, and it just takes a little while to run through the entire P&L. Is that helpful, Rich?\nRich Anderson: Yes. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then would you then sort of characterized Sunbelt as being X money months behind San Francisco, Seattle? Is it a year in your mind if you were to just sort of simplify it?\nMark J. Parrell: I don't have a prediction on that. We told you we didn't put San Francisco and Seattle in this year's improvement bucket. I have high hopes, but it feels like because of supply in Seattle and just job conditions in San Francisco, it could take a little longer, and I think the Sunbelt is just starting its challenges. So, I think both areas will be a little challenged in \u201824.\nRich Anderson: Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next caller is going to be John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. On your blended lease growth, improvement in January, can you comment on how you think this trends for the remainder of the quarter? I realize I expect it to improve in the second quarter. And if there's any discrepancies in the market performance versus what you had in the fourth quarter, as shown in Page 17 of your supplement?\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, John. This is Michael. I could start with that. So, I mean, I think as you look at this and I cited before just the improvement that we saw in San Francisco and Seattle coming off of December and into January with the new lease trends going from, like, a minus 8% in December down to, like, the minus 3.5%? The portfolio itself was at minus 5.7% for new lease change in December and is now in January that we put in the release at a minus 3.7%, the expectations clearly is that you could see with sequential rents improving each week, that number is going to continue to drop, as you work your way through the quarter. So, on the renewal side, it's a little bit of the opposite story. You saw renewals were a 5.2% in the month of December, and in the release, we have January at the 4.9%. The quotes are out there, but we do expect this renewal number to keep trending down as we work our way through. Somewhere in that 4% to 4.5% range is what we expect to achieve off the quotes that are in the marketplace. So, I think you're going to see the interplay between these to shift a little bit where you're going to have strength because you're going to have new lease change starting to recover and hopefully turning positive as we start off the spring leasing season, and we'll see if we keep this kind of momentum in place to do that, and you'll see the moderation of renewals, but still at a really strong number if we come in anywhere between that 4% and 4.5% growth.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And my second question is on, your development yields. Like you said, we're trending closer to 6%, given higher concessions. Can you comment on the level of concessions that you're providing today? And if, is this really driven by your Texas and Denver developments, or is this broad based?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Hi, John. It's Alec. Well, we are literally just starting up our lease ups right now, so we don't have a lot of data yet. We are assuming a month right now, but that could be flexible over time. And, those lease ups are three in Texas, one in suburban New York, which will probably see very little, of that kind of concessions, and then, two in Denver.\nJohn Kim: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Kramer: Hi. Yes, maybe a little bit more of conceptual question and I guess also kind of in-line with Alex Goldfarb's question earlier. But just looking at kind of the new lease change by market, comparing that to the renewal change by market, it's kind of interesting that new lease can vary pretty by some of these markets, but renewals are in a pretty tight band, call it 200 basis point band give or take. And so I guess the question is kind of twofold, right? Is there an ability to maybe push renewals even more And say a market like DC where new lease is holding in a lot better versus kind of expansion markets, right or San Francisco where I guess I'm kind of surprised by that historically widespread between the new and the renewal rate. And should I be maybe a little bit worried about renewals kind of falling a little bit, getting closer to that kind of deeply negative or somewhat negative new lease change? Again, a little bit more of a conceptual question, so apologies, but hopefully that makes sense.\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Adam. It's Michael. So, I mean, I think there's just more stickiness into the renewal stats that you look at this. And you're also coming off of a period of time, which is low transactions. So, there is a little bit of that in these numbers. I think as we think about this I mean, like I said, we have this data going all the way back in time. It's just not uncommon in the fourth quarter to see new lease change goes negative even in a pretty good year with rate growth happening in the marketplace. That new lease change goes negative and renewals stay positive. So, it is a really uncommon situation for our renewal growth to go flat or even think that it's going to be negative. And like I said, we've just put so much into our processes. We have so much good information and insights to it. We got a high degree of confidence. That being said, if there's a big dislocation in the market, right, even the deceleration I mentioned before could be more robust than what we've modeled.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks. That's really helpful and I appreciate that color, and all of kind of the building blocks earlier on the call too. So, maybe on concession usage, I know you've talked about it a little bit on the call thus far, maybe just if you don't mind just some of your expansion markets, kind of the level of concessions in terms of number of weeks that are being offered?\nMark J. Parrell: Yes. So, I think I would just start by just saying that the concession use right now remains concentrated in the Seattle and San Francisco portfolio for us with about 70% of all the concessions being issued. When you drill into the expansion markets, I mean, it's such a small percent of the absolute portfolio. But right now, when you go across them, it's running between, like, 30% and 45% of applications receiving about a month. I'd say Dallas right now is the one market where we're up closer to about six weeks, worth of concessions being issued. And like I said, we would expect that to kind of continue at that level in those expansion markets, and we're watching what's going to be happening with the new lease ups and how competitive are they so that we know where we need to play. The fact that these markets are now, like, 96% or even some of them over 96% with that concession use that we did in the fourth quarter is really a good sign, because the last thing you want to do is turn on concessions, do leasing, and still land at an occupancy like where you started with. That would not be a good situation. So, we feel like the setup right now is defensive. These occupancies are 2% to 3% above. We expect to issue 30% to 40% of our applications receiving concessions of a month to a month and a half in those markets.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks so much for the time.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Haendel St. Juste. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste : Hi, good, I guess, good morning out there to you guys. Mark, I guess the, first question for you, following up on Rich's question earlier about your potential interest in stepping in and participating in other parts of the capital stack, seems a bit of a departure from how you responded to this the Mez Investments in the past. So I guess, first, is that fair and why the change of heart? I'm assuming perhaps it's reflective of the opportunities. But second, I'm assuming or is it fair to assume that you'd be solely focused on the Sunbelt. And then third, what level of return or premium to acquisition cap rates would you seek there? Thanks.\nMark J. Parrell: Okay. I\u2019m going to start with some of that and then Alec may answer parts of it as well, Haendel, but on the Mez Investment side, I think the part that Alec emphasized was the path to ownership. So, what we've been more hesitant to participate in is to just create a book where we are consistently making mezzanine loans or preferred equity investments in deals where it's improbable that we would end up being the owner. When we're working with the lender and the owner and we get in the capital structure and there's a good chance we're going to end up with the deal. That, to us, is very different. That is stuff we did do back in \u201808 or \u201809 through 2010. So, that is a familiar thing for me and Alec and a lot of folks on the team to do. So, that's how I would distinguish the two of those. I don't know if there was anything else in that question you wanted to answer, Alec. No?\nAlexander Brackenridge: No. I think we're good. I mean, we will be opportunistic, though. It's free of our company, and we'll keep looking for, chances to buy great real estate.\nMark J. Parrell: I guess I will, you asked about acquiring assets in one form or another in our established coastal markets, we're certainly open to that. We've got some development deals. We're likely to start in some of those established markets that are in areas really hard to build. But the primary focus is to get into these expansion markets and add capital there.\nHaendel St. Juste : Got you. That's helpful. But a follow-up, what level of return potentially would you or premium, to acquisitions would you seek were you to get involved in, some of these Mez or path to ownership type opportunities?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Hi, Haendel. It's Alec. It\u2019s really impossible to peg that without knowing the specifics of the deal and the circumstances around it. But, obviously, we're very focused on getting compensated for any risk would take beyond a typical transaction.\nHaendel St. Juste : Okay. Fair enough. One more on the expense side. I was hoping for a bit more detail on the key components, appreciate the overall, high level thoughts you provided there earlier, but maybe some specifics on the key components like, what you're embedding in your guide for specifically taxes, insurance, R&M, and also for the ongoing tech initiatives. I think last year, you outlined $10 million or so of savings via that. I'm just curious what level perhaps we could see from tech savings this year? Thanks.\nRobert A. Garechana: Yes. Hi, Haendel, it's Bob. I'll start with some detail on the expenses and then maybe pass it to Michael on the initiatives. I will caveat on the initiative side. Most of our initiatives, as Michael mentioned, are more revenue focused this year than expense focused, but he can touch on, initiatives if I don't cover something. So, on specifics related to some of the categories, we are expecting, as I kind of mentioned, utilities and real estate tax to grow higher than what they did in 2023. That implies or means that at the midpoint, we'd have real estate taxes around, call it a 3%, and utilities more around a 6% growth rate relative to what were, lower growth rates in \u201823. On the other side of the equation on the big categories, you have R&M, which experienced a lot of inflationary pressure in 2023. We expect that to normalize. So we expect, R&M to grow something more like 4%. That is where we are realizing some of the opportunities and, work that we've done on the initiative front to reduce our dependency on contract labor and places where there's wage pressure. So, that's helping us get to that 4%, anticipated growth. And payroll, we think, we're not anticipating as much, challenges on the medical benefit side, and we're just yielding some of the, payroll optimization we did was back end loaded in \u201823, so we'll realize more of that benefit in 2024. Does that help you on the color side? Is there any categories I missed?\nHaendel St. Juste : No. That's helpful. But in relation to I believe it was $10 million that you outlined last year from tech driven efficiencies, first, is that accurate? And second, do you have a comparable figure expectation for this year?\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Haendel. It's Michael. So, let me just start by saying, that really the entire company has been focused around these innovation initiatives for the last several years, and we now have created this foundation that really is going to deliver long-term value creation of the portfolio for many years to come. With the materials that we put in that November investor presentation highlights this technology evolution of this platform, really has been focused on creating the mobility and efficiency in the operating model while the seamless experience to our customer improves. All in, we've identified about $60 million in NOI improvements with about $35 million of that already achieved over the past several years. The early stages of this was clearly more expense focused, and that shows up in our numbers when you look at the low expense growth. And that's mostly in the payroll and some of the R&M accounts over the last couple of years. Going forward, we've identified and we expect about another $25 million. In 2023, we delivered about $10 million in NOI improvement, and about two-thirds of that was on the expense categories, primarily in the payroll accounts, and a couple of million dollars of that was in the revenue front. Specific to 2024, we've layered in another $10 million included in guidance with about $7.5 million in other income accounts. And this is realized growth as the annualized number from all of these initiatives is greater because some of these are back half loaded, meaning I only get about half of the benefit this year. So, overall, I guess, I would just say is this operating foundation is almost in place, and you really should expect that the future years are going to continue to have more revenue enhancement opportunities. But the reality is, I mean, we're never really done with this pursuit of operational excellence. It's something that's wired into the DNA of our company, and I'm sure as this year goes on, we're going to identify new things for future years as well.\nHaendel St. Juste : Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead.\nRob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Alec, can you talk about how robust the market is for dispositions in quality of life areas like urban Seattle, San Francisco or markets with ongoing bad debt issues like LA, are things trading and where are they pricing versus a few years ago if they are?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Yes. Thanks, Rob. It's Alec. There's almost no activity in the markets listed. I mean, we're we test from time-to-time. Not saying we wouldn't sell something, but right now, I don't, I couldn't tell you what market cap rates are because they just haven't been frayed. So, it is really frozen there. So frankly, we've concentrated our efforts elsewhere.\nRob Stevenson: And I mean, is that just hold-on for a couple of years, hope that the cities get their act together, or is there something else just simply buy lower price capital that will allow that to sort of come back or are there you anticipating some sort of level of permanent impairment on some of those markets and submarkets?\nAlexander Brackenridge: No, I think all of the things that you mentioned are likely to happen. There is a tremendous amount of capital on the sidelines. These cities are still great cities. The cities themselves are doing a lot, particularly in San Francisco and Seattle to improve the quality of life. I mean, they're making some really serious headways. And as Mark, talked about, we expect them to recover as the jobs recover. But even absent that, we're at 96% occupancy. It's just investors sentiment's really negative right now, and, we think that there are better opportunities elsewhere, and we're frankly a buyer of what it sounds like people would transact right now.\nMark J. Parrell: And, Rob, just to add to that. I mean, these markets, Seattle and San Francisco, particularly though, you could think about downtown LA too. We may have powerful drivers. For us, it's like we talked about New York when everyone was down on New York City, and we were positive on it still. That recovery has been vibrant. I think it's the same pattern here. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when, and I think these markets will recover greatly on the rental side over the next few years. What we shied away from on this call is, excessive enthusiasm too early in the year when you're not really into the leasing season yet, in markets that do have volatility associated with them. So, I don't feel any sense of permanent impairment in these markets at all. I think that you're going to have great rental growth. You're going to have a recovery that's pretty strong in these markets. And you are likely, but not certain to follow a pattern like in New York, where again, the sales market has some deals in it in New York, and they're trading really well. And so, I'm not sure why in a few years, San Francisco and Seattle wouldn't trade very well as well, but it's just going to take some time. And, again, our hesitancy here is really around the timeline for this, not the occurrence of it. And I think it's a catalyst for our investors. I think having, a portion of the portfolio and unrecovered markets with rents lower than they were in \u201819 and incomes a lot higher is a huge potential piece of kindling wood to our earnings in future years.\nRob Stevenson: Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly for me, Bob, what's the $0.06 difference between day REIT and normalized FFO guidance? Is that one or two large items that you're expecting or a bunch of small ones given what you know today?\nRobert A. Garechana: Yes. There's one larger contributor which I'll talk about, which is, advocacy costs. So, we are forecasting higher levels of advocacy the cost in 2024, given that it's an election year and some of the ballot sheet, ballot initiatives, sorry, that we are facing, which is not atypical as in other election years. And then the remaining pieces are typical forecast for pursuit costs and other items.\nRob Stevenson: Is that advocacy in California or is there other markets as well or is that entire spend out there?\nRobert A. Garechana: It's predominantly California.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And is there anything, I guess, related to that that you're especially worried about this cycle? I mean, I know that a lot of this stuff keeps being put on every other ballot or every ballot, but I mean is there anything that's looking like this year or 2024 is the chance that it really passes, it would wind up being a negative for you guys?\nMark J. Parrell: Rob, it's Mark. I mean, there's negatives and there's positives in the regulatory area. The ballot measure is by far the biggest point of focus in the industry. And just to remind everyone, this has been on the ballot twice before. The citizens of California rejected it by 20 percentage points each time. The industry is well organized. We're going to make the same good arguments about supply being the solution, more rental voucher funding being the solution. And to be honest, the Governor Newsom and the legislature have done a lot of supply things with the accessory dwelling unit legislation, with some of the zoning reforms. And so to be honest, when I turn to the positive on the regulatory side, people would hear us. They hear the industry's point about supply, about zoning reform. Governor DeSantis, obviously, couldn't be more different than Governor Newsom. He has done some great things in Florida as it relates to housing policy as well and zoning reform to allow more affordable housing to be built. Governor Hochul in New York was trying the same thing and got a lot of resistance, but we hope that is still in place. So California is, to answer your question, the focal point of us in the industry at large this year. But markets like New York and, Massachusetts and Colorado, there's always dialogue going on in those markets, but we're well organized to have that conversation. And I think policymakers, by and large, understand that supplies the answer, not rental regulation. That's what I think is the positive here. You hear about that a lot more in our conversations, and the reaction to rent control is, something that we talk through and, you get a lot of people calling the other direction after they've heard the arguments.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time.\nMark J. Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come Anthony Powell. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. A question on new and renewal lease spreads and the leases. I'm curious, what's the absolute, I guess, rent these two group consultants are paying in terms of both gross and net effective? I'm trying to understand better about what, the actual numbers are from these two, customer groups?\nMichael L. Manelis: Hi, Anthony. This is Michael. Can you ask that again? I'm not sure I'm following the absolute rent part of the equation.\nAnthony Powell: Yes. So, in terms of this new renewal leases, absolute rent, is there a big difference between the two? Are customers paying, lower or higher of renewing new leases? I'm trying to get a sense of the absolute pricing difference between the two groups of customers.\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. I think when you look at it on the new lease side because of the concessions that we're offering in some of them, I think it lowers, like, the net effective rate when you look at the absolute average of all the leases that we wrote versus the renewals.\nRobert A. Garechana: And one thing to keep in mind, too, Anthony, is when you're looking at the spread so if you're starting with market rate rents, right, and looking at market and that's kind of your pricing trend or whatever. Spreads can vary materially depending on who is in the mix of, moving in and moving out. So, if I have lived in a unit for one year and got a big concession, as Michael used an example, in an expansion market, and I happen to be the one renewing, then that spread can be very different than the absolute. So, just keep that in mind, as you look at any of these spreads. And then particularly keep it in mind as you think about seasonal periods, like the first quarter and the fourth quarter where transaction activity is really low. You can have even more volatility in the number.\nAnthony Powell: All right. Thank you. And maybe one more on transaction activity. Do you expect to see any portfolio deals, later this year? Or do you expect your deal activity to be more single asset as we had been recently?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Anthony, it's Alec. I don't know if I expect to. I certainly hope to and I think we probably will, but it remains to be seen. But there's some things out there that we've heard about that might be interesting, and we'll certainly be very actively pursuing them.\nAnthony Powell: Thank you.\nAlexander Brackenridge: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. Thank you. Just one question. In your prepared comments, you highlighted seeing stability and pullback in Seattle and San Francisco. Could you discuss that dynamic more? Is this volatility associated with job loss and return to work mandates or maybe just provide some examples of what drives this push and pull?\nMichael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Linda. This is Michael. So, I think clearly job growth is one of the catalysts that does that. The migration patterns also influence that. So, where you see a lot more of your move-ins coming to you from within the MSA, that's usually deal seekers. Those are people that are responding to see in the concessions and either breaking their lease where they were to move into it. So, it just you just haven't seen, like, the sustained momentum that you would expect based on seasonal trends. I think last year, you saw some of those layoff announcements. You saw a lot of ambiguity around return to office where people were just waiting to see what their employer was going to do, before they decided to make any kind of relocation decisions to get nearer into where their offices were. I still think some of that exists in the marketplace today. But what we did see and what we see right now is that the setup in both of those markets has positioned us with good occupancy. We are starting to pull back concessions. The marketplace, still has concessions in them, and we'll just watch and see that build as we get in towards March and April to see what pricing power really looks like. But there's a lot of factors that are going into why a market all of a sudden kind of stalls out and whether or not it shows you sustained momentum more in-line with seasonal trends.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nOperator: And I have no further questions left in the queue. I'll turn it back over to Mark Parrell for closing comments.\nMark J. Parrell: Thank you all for hanging in there on this long call. We appreciate your, interest and your time today. Good day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark J. Parrell",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 results and the outlook for 2024. I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance and 2024 operating expectations, and followed by Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, who'll give some color on our capital allocation activities in the transactions markets. And then finally, Bob Garechana, our CFO, will review our 2024 guidance and our balance sheet, and then we'll take your questions. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance, which was in-line with our October expectations. Our performance in 2023 was supported by a strong employment situation, more than 2.7 million new jobs created. And while the 2024 outlook for overall jobs is more muted, we should benefit from a continued low unemployment rate for the college educated, which currently sits around 2.1%, as well as continued good real wage growth. We will also benefit in 2024 from having low exposure to new supply in the vast majority of our markets, particularly when compared to the Sunbelt markets, as well as the customer comfortably able to pay our rents with current rent income levels at about 20%. Overall, with low unemployment and rising real wages, our target renter demographic remains in good shape. They are likely to rent with us longer as the prospect of homeownership in the near-term seems less likely with scarce inventory and relatively high mortgage rates. Less than 8% of our residents who moved out gave bought home as a reason to depart in 2023, which is the lowest we have seen since we started tracking the number. And over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across our country sets us up for good long-term demand. Drilling down on the West Coast, we do see clear signs of improvement in quality of life and energy on the street in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. We continue to believe a recovery in rental rates in the downtown submarkets of these metros is coming and expect our shareholders will benefit from catch up rental growth in these places, where rents are still at or a fair bit below 2019 levels and where incomes, both on a nominal and real basis, have risen substantially since 2019. So, while we have not baked the material improvement in Seattle and San Francisco performance in our 2024 guidance expectations, we do note that other urban centers damaged by the pandemic and other negative trends, for example, New York City, reignited quickly and sharply off of depressed rent levels once quality of life and employment conditions improved. Switching to the cost side of the equation, our consistent ability to grow expenses and overhead more slowly than our competitors. We'll preserve cash flow for our shareholders as rent growth slows across the country and positions us well once growth picks back up. As it relates to capital allocation, before Alec, goes through the details of our recent transaction activities and our view of forward market conditions, I do want to highlight that we bought back some of our stock in the fourth quarter for the first time in many years. We bought back a little more than 864,000 EQR common shares for a total of about $49 million spent at about $57 per share. We funded this repurchase activity with proceeds from sales during January of less desirable assets that were on average 40 years old and we're sold at a 5.6% disposition yield and believe that at this stock price and funded with these disposition proceeds, buying our shares makes a very good investment, especially given the lack of available assets to acquire at reasonable prices. Before I turn the call over, I want to thank our teams across the company for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and producing strong results for our shareholders. Now I'll turn call over to Michael Manelis. Hi, Eric, it's Mark. Just to start, the others can contribute. I mean, you look at the numbers in DC and Boston and New York last year were outstanding. So, we're being thoughtful. We're being a little cautious going into a volatile year, but your restatement of the setup is correct. I mean, those northeast markets have steady demand, by and large, minimal supply or in DC's case, strong absorption characteristics. I mean, we're optimistic those markets can continue to do well. In some cases, like New York, and Michael alluded to that, they're coming off really big rent growth years. In some cases, there's a little bit of a pause to catch your breath and let resident incomes grow to catch up to rental growth. But, I mean, if you didn't get that message, we're super optimistic about the northeast markets and think they will do very well. It's just trying to handicap all the various crosscurrents in the economy that are challenging for us. Yes. I'm just going to add a little bit to that. If you look at \u201825 expected deliveries and some stuff from \u201824 will definitely slip, I mean, it's about as big as \u201823's delivery. So, it's not like \u201825 is a, incredible decline. So, what we really see, Jeff, as we look at this is still good demand in those markets. That's why we like Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver, Austin and Atlanta. But the supply picture in our experience, we'll spend this whole year with declining new lease rates, occupancy pressure, all of those things, and you as an investor and an analyst may start to see improvement in that so called second derivative of rent growth late this year beginning of \u201825. But same store revenue growth in our experience will be worse in \u201825, not in \u201824 because all those leases that are being rewritten will go through the rent roll. And so you may be more optimistic in \u201825, but your numbers actually likely will be worse. So, that's what we've seen with supply in our history across our markets, and then we don't really see why it'd be any different here. And I think the wild card is if you have incredible job growth in these markets, you may be able to absorb some of this supply more efficiently and get through it more quickly. But the idea that \u201824 is the only oversupplied year is kind of a tough one for us to accept. Well, the guidance is just to help you model. If Alec, can buy things in his team earlier at good prices, we'll buy them earlier. The relationship I think you're going to see here is that prices now seem okay, maybe not quite good enough, but the discount to basis, the replacement cost, pardon me, is very good. It's the cap rate. And when you look at, like, two years of declining rental growth, you buy in Dallas, your year two number might be lower your cap rate than your year one. But on the other hand, later this year, you'll be past some of that and your year two number will look a little better. So, likely paying a higher price. So, that's what you're going to see us navigate. We like these markets long-term. We think owning the four markets that we've, tabbed as our expansion markets, say, 25% of the company will create more balance and drive growth better and reduce volatility over time, Jeff. But getting into them is a little bit of an art. There's going to be a little bit that we probably do sooner, a little bit we do later, and you may feel better about the price in one and not as good about the revenue growth in the other and vice versa. But, we're prepared to do that. And, again, the number you see there is just sort of the guidance assumption. We'd be happy to do more if we can find more. Hi, Robin, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. Our primary capital allocation goal is going to remain building out the portfolio in the way I just described in these expansion markets and lowering exposure in Washington DC, New York, and California. Again, we believe that portfolio will create the highest returns over time, the lowest volatility, that that'll make the shareholders the most money in the long haul. All that said, we're going to continue to consider these share buybacks, especially when you get this bigger value dislocation and when you can fund it with assets that are the least desirable, among the least desirable in the portfolio against the portfolio that we think is really top notch and where there isn't a lot to buy. That's an important other ingredient. There wasn't a lot of opportunity cost here, there wasn't a lot else available to buy at prices that made sense and all those capital structure considerations have to be thought about too. We've talked about on these calls. Things like, does it create a lot of tax gain that's hard for a REIT to manage. That worked out okay for us. Bob has done a great job and his team on the balance sheet, so I don't have to worry about debt maturities that we need to kind of husband our capital. And another I want to introduce is you got to be careful about platform scaling. If you sell too many assets, you can really increase your overhead as a percentage of revenue. But all that said, the Board and the management team remain open to buybacks. And for us, it's hard for me to give you a formula. We're just going to kind of see what market conditions are, where the stock goes, what's out there to buy, and, keep our mind open to doing more, stock buybacks. Hi, Michael, it's Mark, and I think, Michael Manelis may have something to add here. So, we talked a lot about San Francisco on the call, the last one and why we like the market long-term, feel the same way. The management team thinks there's going to be elongated recovery in that market. Conditions on the ground are a lot better. The mayor put out some information about crime reductions. They have the biggest class of police cadets, at the police academy in San Francisco, they've had since before the pandemic. So, there's some good things going on. But until, as Michael said, we get a little more tech job growth, which talking to the team and talking to others in the Bay area and in the city of San Francisco is probably a more later \u201824, \u201825 thing. That's probably where you get rent to take off. The thing I want you to think about is, you've had spectacular growth in incomes in the Bay area since 2019, over 30% nominal and 12% or 13% on a real basis, yet our rents are down in the city of San Francisco 20% since 2019 and kind of flattish to up marginally in the Bay area. So, this is a market that, like New York, can really take off once you get some job growth, because there isn't a lot of new supply. Housing costs are pretty high. So, the management team's optimistic about the recovery. The timing is kind of tough. I don't know, Michael, if you've got anything you want to add. Yes. I forgot to mention something on Seattle I just want to throw out there. Seattle's nominal wage growth since 2019 is 40%, right. Yet our rents in that market are up 7%, and downtown, they're flat. So, again, these markets have the ability to pay more for great quality housing. And, again, Seattle is a supply, push this year, but after that, it gets a lot lighter. So, that's about a third of our portfolio, Seattle and San Francisco. And I hope, Michael, we're talking about that second derivative towards the end of this year for you, but we haven't embedded that into our guidance. Yes. Thanks for that question, Jamie. I guess I attack it another way by certainly lease ups are different. But remember, the numbers we're telling you are same store numbers, so they won't include lease up conversations. But I would say we have relatively small portfolios in those markets. So, if one property is being hit hard, it could be one out of eight of our same store assets in, Denver. So, I think that is it. I think different people, obviously, different parts of the market feel it differently. So, that would be my comment. We have relatively small portfolios. I mean, Austin, we have three same store assets. We'd love to move more quickly in completing our, repositioning. I don't feel any need to do that by selling assets cheap. I think you'll continue to see us, sell assets that are a little bit less desirable from our point of view. It's more about the difference, Jamie, between the sale and the buy, if we can sell things well, we can pay up a little bit on the buy side. And, again, we're creating that diversification we value. So, it's a little bit about if we're doing trading like that, it's going to depend on both the sale price and the buy price. To the extent we try and expand the company through debt activities, then the interest rate that Bob's borrowing at is going to become more relevant. So, I think right now would be somewhere in the name of where the 5% for 10 year money. So, I hope that's helpful, but we'd like to move faster. We point out that since 2019, when we started this, we've moved billions of dollars of capital into those markets, but the transaction markets have been closed for half of the last four and a half years because of COVID and because of the Fed. So, we're hopeful that in a wide open year, I mean, we did, I think, $1.7 billion back in \u201822. We're capable of doing $2 billion plus a year for sure. If the opportunities present themselves and we push the gas hard, it's got to make some sense. De minimis dilution is one thing. Wholesale dilution would require some sort of justification that, we could get on this call and you all would feel was compelling. We would accept some dilution to complete our strategic repositioning. The IRR matters. I mean, these deals got to make sense. We like owning newer assets because we'll have less capital. At the end of the day, the portfolios we'll own in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, and Austin. We'll be the youngest portfolios of our REIT competitors. We think that's beneficial to our shareholders on the IRR CapEx side, not just on the NOI side. So, yes, we want to push the gas on this. We want to move this along. The IRR matters. The cap rate matters, dilution matters, but, getting it done matters a lot. I guess we'll see. I our sense, again, from all our comments on San Francisco and Seattle is that they still are appealing places for our demographic to live that people will want to live in the center of those cities and the whole market and that, I don't know about some sort of wholesale repricing. And you saw New York recovered smartly on the rent side, and there's some deals going on in the investment sales market that would support New York trading at a lower cap rate as it historically has than the national average. So, I think the story is yet to be told on the West Coast markets because there's just no one selling, in the urban centers. But, I don't think, there's an answer to that, but I think the appeal of those centers is true and obvious and will come, and we've kind of given you our view of that. Yes. Well, I'm going to say is just how we've seen things play out in our market. So, the first thing that you see is you start to see a decline in occupancy when you get all of this, when you get a lot supply or big demand drop or both. So, the markets you've seen competitors in the RealPage numbers sort of show declines in occupancy. That pressures owners to give concessions and lower face rate, and then that in turn eventually affects same store revenue, which is, of course, the interplay between occupancy rate, renewals, and the whole nine yards. And so, in when it reverses, the exact opposite happens. First, you start to see, I'm building my occupancy a little. As Michael spoke to Seattle and San Francisco, that gives you a little bit of confidence. So, now you're going to take away of your concessions, you're going to try to move rate up a little, especially in the spring leasing season, you're going to test that as that improves, and, eventually, that'll flow through to your same store revenue number. So, that's what I mean by that comment. So that this year, same store revenue might hold up better in a heavily supplied market or a demand challenged market because you're looking at a situation where your rents, you haven't rewritten every lease down yet. But over the course of two years, you will. And in that process, that second year same store revenue number is often lower, But we're often telling you, hey, you know what? New lease is going up. We're feeling better in a market. And that's what I'm sort of expecting. We'll see how it goes, but my expectation is sometime in \u201825, folks will be talking about an improvement in some of those, I call it second derivative, but new lease rates, street rent numbers, and it isn't going to be dramatic right away, but it's sort of some solidification of that that's really built on occupancy starting to improve. So, again, you got all this supply. Our experience is it compounds. It gets worse before it gets better, and it just takes a little while to run through the entire P&L. Is that helpful, Rich? I don't have a prediction on that. We told you we didn't put San Francisco and Seattle in this year's improvement bucket. I have high hopes, but it feels like because of supply in Seattle and just job conditions in San Francisco, it could take a little longer, and I think the Sunbelt is just starting its challenges. So, I think both areas will be a little challenged in \u201824. Yes. So, I think I would just start by just saying that the concession use right now remains concentrated in the Seattle and San Francisco portfolio for us with about 70% of all the concessions being issued. When you drill into the expansion markets, I mean, it's such a small percent of the absolute portfolio. But right now, when you go across them, it's running between, like, 30% and 45% of applications receiving about a month. I'd say Dallas right now is the one market where we're up closer to about six weeks, worth of concessions being issued. And like I said, we would expect that to kind of continue at that level in those expansion markets, and we're watching what's going to be happening with the new lease ups and how competitive are they so that we know where we need to play. The fact that these markets are now, like, 96% or even some of them over 96% with that concession use that we did in the fourth quarter is really a good sign, because the last thing you want to do is turn on concessions, do leasing, and still land at an occupancy like where you started with. That would not be a good situation. So, we feel like the setup right now is defensive. These occupancies are 2% to 3% above. We expect to issue 30% to 40% of our applications receiving concessions of a month to a month and a half in those markets. Okay. I'm going to start with some of that and then Alec may answer parts of it as well, Haendel, but on the Mez Investment side, I think the part that Alec emphasized was the path to ownership. So, what we've been more hesitant to participate in is to just create a book where we are consistently making mezzanine loans or preferred equity investments in deals where it's improbable that we would end up being the owner. When we're working with the lender and the owner and we get in the capital structure and there's a good chance we're going to end up with the deal. That, to us, is very different. That is stuff we did do back in \u201808 or \u201809 through 2010. So, that is a familiar thing for me and Alec and a lot of folks on the team to do. So, that's how I would distinguish the two of those. I don't know if there was anything else in that question you wanted to answer, Alec. No? I guess I will, you asked about acquiring assets in one form or another in our established coastal markets, we're certainly open to that. We've got some development deals. We're likely to start in some of those established markets that are in areas really hard to build. But the primary focus is to get into these expansion markets and add capital there. And, Rob, just to add to that. I mean, these markets, Seattle and San Francisco, particularly though, you could think about downtown LA too. We may have powerful drivers. For us, it's like we talked about New York when everyone was down on New York City, and we were positive on it still. That recovery has been vibrant. I think it's the same pattern here. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when, and I think these markets will recover greatly on the rental side over the next few years. What we shied away from on this call is, excessive enthusiasm too early in the year when you're not really into the leasing season yet, in markets that do have volatility associated with them. So, I don't feel any sense of permanent impairment in these markets at all. I think that you're going to have great rental growth. You're going to have a recovery that's pretty strong in these markets. And you are likely, but not certain to follow a pattern like in New York, where again, the sales market has some deals in it in New York, and they're trading really well. And so, I'm not sure why in a few years, San Francisco and Seattle wouldn't trade very well as well, but it's just going to take some time. And, again, our hesitancy here is really around the timeline for this, not the occurrence of it. And I think it's a catalyst for our investors. I think having, a portion of the portfolio and unrecovered markets with rents lower than they were in \u201819 and incomes a lot higher is a huge potential piece of kindling wood to our earnings in future years. Rob, it's Mark. I mean, there's negatives and there's positives in the regulatory area. The ballot measure is by far the biggest point of focus in the industry. And just to remind everyone, this has been on the ballot twice before. The citizens of California rejected it by 20 percentage points each time. The industry is well organized. We're going to make the same good arguments about supply being the solution, more rental voucher funding being the solution. And to be honest, the Governor Newsom and the legislature have done a lot of supply things with the accessory dwelling unit legislation, with some of the zoning reforms. And so to be honest, when I turn to the positive on the regulatory side, people would hear us. They hear the industry's point about supply, about zoning reform. Governor DeSantis, obviously, couldn't be more different than Governor Newsom. He has done some great things in Florida as it relates to housing policy as well and zoning reform to allow more affordable housing to be built. Governor Hochul in New York was trying the same thing and got a lot of resistance, but we hope that is still in place. So California is, to answer your question, the focal point of us in the industry at large this year. But markets like New York and, Massachusetts and Colorado, there's always dialogue going on in those markets, but we're well organized to have that conversation. And I think policymakers, by and large, understand that supplies the answer, not rental regulation. That's what I think is the positive here. You hear about that a lot more in our conversations, and the reaction to rent control is, something that we talk through and, you get a lot of people calling the other direction after they've heard the arguments. Thank you. Thank you all for hanging in there on this long call. We appreciate your, interest and your time today. Good day."

            "name": "Robert A. Garechana",
            "content": "Thanks, Alec. As Michael and Mark mentioned, 2023 ended up right in-line with our forecast last quarter. So, let's get right to guidance. Michael gave you most of the building blocks for same store revenue, but I'll finish up with bad debt, walk through drivers of same store expenses and normalized FFO and conclude with the balance sheet. In 2023, we were able to reduce bad debt significantly once the regulatory environment became more constructive. While we continue to work with non-paying residents, as we have during and after the pandemic, ultimately, we still ended up processing a high volume of skips and evicts. In fact, about 1.5 times pre-pandemic activity levels, which coupled with not adding significant amounts of new non-paying residents, helped us reduce bad debt as a percentage of same store revenue from well over 2% to just under 1.5%. So, great progress overall, but still a long way from the 50 basis points we were accustomed to pre-pandemic. Much like last year, we expect 2024 to continue to show improvement. We also expect the pace of this improvement to be dependent on the speed of the court systems, primarily in Southern California, where delinquency remains highest, to quickly process evictions, which is a hard thing to predict. As a result, our guidance assumes that 2024 remains another transition year for bad debt and that we don't get all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, our guidance midpoint assumes that full-year bad debt as a percentage of same store residential revenue is slightly above 1% or a 30 basis point contribution to 2024 growth overall. If that plays out, by the end of 2024, we would expect to be a little under two times pre-pandemic levels. Turning to expenses. Expense management is core strength at Equity Residential as evidenced by the historical performance Mark referenced. Our same store expense guidance of 4% is also reflective of that discipline. This year, the individual drivers of growth are a little different than those from 2023. So, let me give you a high level assessment, and we can get into more detail in Q&A if required. In 2024, we expect real estate taxes and utilities to grow faster than they did in 2023, in part due to some 421-A step ups and commodity prices, while payroll and repairs and maintenance should be slower due to various initiatives and an expected normalization of inflationary pressures. Insurance, a small category at less than 5% of total expenses, but a topic often discussed should grow more slowly than last year, but remain above the long-term trend with growth in the low-double-digits. Turning to normalized FFO, Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. As is typical, same store NOI performance is the primary driver of growth, but let me provide some color on transaction activity. We are assuming $1 billion in both acquisitions and dispositions for 2024 with limited dilution, yet we show a $0.03 reduction in normalized FFO growth there. This is due to our assumption that our acquisition activity mostly occurs later in the year than our dispositions. This is also partially offset in interest expense and interest income as disposition proceeds are used to pay down debt or invested in interest bearing 1031 accounts while we await acquisitions. Now a very brief comment on the balance sheet, because we're in really great shape here. We have no debt maturities until the middle of 2025, modest outstanding balances on our commercial paper program and less than 10% floating rate debt. So, we're very well-positioned. In fact, over 50% of our existing debt doesn't mature until after 2030. The work we've done over the last number of years has reduced our interest rate exposure and allows us for ample debt capacity to run and grow our business. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator. Yes. Hi, Robin. It's Bob. Thanks for the question. We are seeing lower values in some markets. In fact, we've gotten some assessed values, actually back already, as we look at 2024. And on the margin, you are seeing some decreases. So for instance, in Washington state, we saw about a 1% decrease, and we've got most of the values back there, and we're seeing it in other places. Obviously the income, as assessors look at values, the income production in 2023 was really quite good. But the offset there was really the cap rate change just given risk free rates and other things. And so we are seeing some acknowledgment by assessors that values are in fact, lower than what they had initially assessed at. The open item as you think about real estate taxes for 2024 will be where rate comes. And we have rates in some places, and we'll see where they, fall out in others. You are correct, and that makes for an excellent appeal activity for our real estate tax team as we challenge values. Thanks. Yes. I'll grab that, Michael. It's Bob. So, to start with what's assumed in guidance, we do assume that we will get, we will improve. So, we ended the year at, call it, 1.4% of bad debt as a percentage of same store revenue. I think I said in my remarks, we expect to get to 1% a little over 1% for the full year. That means that by the fourth quarter, we're assuming that we're sub, 1%. You're correct in the kind of 3Q to 4Q in 2023 it being flattish, and what I would caution and is that it is, this is a thing that is very hard predict because of the court systems. It has puts and takes. There's more of a step function than a linear kind of improvement function associated with it. So, our expectations and guidance is that, Q1, which we're in right now is more flattish, and that you started see seeing improvement later in Q2, Q3, and Q4, because of that kind of case of the court system and because there is there's always been a little bit of seasonality in this number as you think about, like, post holidays, bad debt in the first quarter is always or typically a little bit higher anyways. So, expect it a little bit of a choppy step function, but expect improvement overall. Yes. Hi, Haendel, it's Bob. I'll start with some detail on the expenses and then maybe pass it to Michael on the initiatives. I will caveat on the initiative side. Most of our initiatives, as Michael mentioned, are more revenue focused this year than expense focused, but he can touch on, initiatives if I don't cover something. So, on specifics related to some of the categories, we are expecting, as I kind of mentioned, utilities and real estate tax to grow higher than what they did in 2023. That implies or means that at the midpoint, we'd have real estate taxes around, call it a 3%, and utilities more around a 6% growth rate relative to what were, lower growth rates in \u201823. On the other side of the equation on the big categories, you have R&M, which experienced a lot of inflationary pressure in 2023. We expect that to normalize. So we expect, R&M to grow something more like 4%. That is where we are realizing some of the opportunities and, work that we've done on the initiative front to reduce our dependency on contract labor and places where there's wage pressure. So, that's helping us get to that 4%, anticipated growth. And payroll, we think, we're not anticipating as much, challenges on the medical benefit side, and we're just yielding some of the, payroll optimization we did was back end loaded in \u201823, so we'll realize more of that benefit in 2024. Does that help you on the color side? Is there any categories I missed? Yes. There's one larger contributor which I'll talk about, which is, advocacy costs. So, we are forecasting higher levels of advocacy the cost in 2024, given that it's an election year and some of the ballot sheet, ballot initiatives, sorry, that we are facing, which is not atypical as in other election years. And then the remaining pieces are typical forecast for pursuit costs and other items. It's predominantly California. And one thing to keep in mind, too, Anthony, is when you're looking at the spread so if you're starting with market rate rents, right, and looking at market and that's kind of your pricing trend or whatever. Spreads can vary materially depending on who is in the mix of, moving in and moving out. So, if I have lived in a unit for one year and got a big concession, as Michael used an example, in an expansion market, and I happen to be the one renewing, then that spread can be very different than the absolute. So, just keep that in mind, as you look at any of these spreads. And then particularly keep it in mind as you think about seasonal periods, like the first quarter and the fourth quarter where transaction activity is really low. You can have even more volatility in the number."

            "name": "Michael L. Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter 2023 operating performance and our outlook for 2024. We produced same store revenue growth of 3.9% and same store expense growth of only 1.3% in the fourth quarter, both of which were in-line with our expectations. On the expense side, our low growth in the quarter and full-year 4.3% growth were helped by modest property tax cost as well as the savings produced as we continue to roll out initiatives focused on creating operating efficiencies and a seamless customer experience. On the revenue side, the momentum in December was a little better than we thought as sequentially we grew revenue in the fourth quarter by holding onto more occupancy, while maintaining positive blended rate growth. This set us up for a good start in 2024. Demand was solid across our markets and consistent with seasonal expectations. We finished the year with same store physical occupancy at 96% as we focused on building up occupancy in the slower part of our leasing cycle. Today, the portfolio is above 96%. As expected, we saw new lease rates go negative in the quarter as they typically do. Meanwhile, renewal rates for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which was slightly above our expectations. Together, this resulted in a fourth quarter blended rate growth of positive 80 basis points. These healthy fundamentals led to outstanding revenue growth in our East Coast markets and good growth in Southern California. As has been the case all year, the East Coast markets outperform the West Coast and by and large will likely continue to do so in 2024. As you saw in our earnings release, we have provided 2024 same store revenue guidance range of up 2% to 3%. The building blocks for this growth starts with embedded growth of 1.4% and a midpoint assumption that both physical occupancy and cash concessions remain consistent with that of 2023. We expect the year to follow the traditional pre-COVID historical patterns with rent growth sequentially picking up in the spring and likely peaking in August. Our midpoint assumes renewals for the year averaged just over 4%. New lease change is relatively flat, which together produces blended rate growth of about 2%. This is more modest growth than the 2023 full-year blended rate growth of 3.1% and is reflective of a slowing job growth environment offset by a mostly positive supply situation in our coastal market, where we have about 95% of our NOI. As you can see from the stats in the release, January is starting out the way we would expect with new lease change improving, a strong percent of residents renewing, and a renewal rate achieved that is healthy, albeit moderating a bit. While still early, all of these January trends support our outlook for the year, which includes a view that resident retention remains very good, as a result of both the benefits of a centralized renewal process, our enhanced data and analytics insights and the high cost and low availability of owned housing in our markets. Turnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen in the history of our company and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. Orange County, San Diego, Boston, and Washington DC will lead the pack with expected revenue growth of approximately 4%. New York and LA will follow closely behind. At the moment, we expect slightly positive same store revenue growth in San Francisco and Seattle, and in our expansion markets, which reflect only about 5.5% percent of the total company NOI, we expect to produce negative same store revenue growth given the unprecedented levels of supply being delivered. As we look to the individual markets, starting with Boston, with high occupancy and limited new competitive supply. This market should continue to perform well in 2024. The market is supported by a strong employment base and finance, tech, life science, health and education. New supply deliveries will be about the same this year as they were in 2023, and this is a market where our urban assets have outperformed suburban ones lately and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. New York should continue to perform well this year, but won't reach the high rate growth achieved over the last few years. Occupancies remain high and competitive new supply is limited, which led to record high market rents, causing some rate fatigue to be observed in late in '23. New supply deliveries will be similar to last year with very little being delivered in Manhattan, where a large part of our portfolio is located. Washington DC continues to outperform our expectations despite the delivery of a good amount of new supply. The market delivered over 13,000 units in 2023 and saw the great majority of those units absorbed. This year, the market will see a similar amount of deliveries, but demand has been strong and we expect this good performance to continue. We are starting the year with occupancies above 97%, which is a great position to be in. In Los Angeles, we expect the tailwind to growth as we work through the delinquency and bad debt issues that have been concentrated here. We continue to make progress, although the court system remains slow, taking at least six months from our court filing to being able to get the unit back. Bob will give some more color on the impact of bad debt net on our 2024 earnings expectations. New supply deliveries will be slightly higher this year with our Mid-Wilshire Koreatown and San Fernando Valley portfolio seeing the largest impact from this new supply. Strong retention and solid demand will continue to aid our ability to fill vacant units with paying residents in this market. Rounding out Southern California, San Diego, and Orange County should be some of our highest growth markets this year, driven by high occupancies and a general lack of housing. High homeownership costs make renting in these markets a more attractive option. San Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year. In San Francisco and Seattle, we had little to no pricing power throughout 2023 and our base case expectations for this year assume that situation continues. We have seen periods of stability and then pullbacks. Concession use in both markets is widespread. We have strong physical occupancy with both markets being above 96%, which tells us there is demand, although it is very price sensitive. As Mark mentioned, the downtown areas of both markets continue to see improvement in the quality of life, but are still lacking the catalyst of return to office and or job growth. New supply in San Francisco this year will be up from last year levels, mostly due to an increase in the South Bay, although continued healthy demand in this submarket should aid the absorption. Seattle is likely to be the most impacted of any of our markets when it comes to new supply deliveries with increases in both the City of Seattle and the Eastside. The lack of expected job growth combined with this new supply has driven our low expectations in Seattle for 2024. Both Seattle and San Francisco continue to see less than normal inbound migration. Seattle in the fourth quarter, however, did see some relative improvement with new residents coming to us from out of state. This positive trend is something that we will keep an eye on as we move through the spring leasing season. Drawing new residents back to the MSAs in both Seattle and San Francisco would be a catalyst for these markets to outperform our expectations. In the expansion markets, our long-term outlook remained positive. That said, high levels of new supply are already pressuring rents and is likely to continue throughout 2024. At present, we are operating from a defensive position and starting the year with occupancies that are two to three percentage points above the market averages. Denver has demonstrated the most stability despite having limited pricing power in the portfolio, and we expect the market to produce slightly positive same store revenue growth in 2024. Currently, Atlanta is using the least demonic concessions, but we expect a few of our assets to be very challenged due to the sheer number of lease ups in close proximity, which will likely lead to negative revenue growth for the year. In Texas, Dallas and Austin have widespread concession use, and we expect all of our assets to experience direct pressure from new deliveries all year long, resulting in negative same store revenue growth in these markets. So, putting all of these factors together, our overall same store revenue outlook for 2024, right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets and Southern California, which collectively is almost 70% of our NOI. We expect our coastal existing markets to outperform our expansion markets where unprecedented supply will impact operations near-term. On the initiative side, in 2024, we will continue to focus on producing operating efficiencies and driving other income with projects tied to flexible living options, parking, renter's insurance, and monetizing technology deployed for the benefits of our residents. We are almost complete with the rollout of smart home technology across our portfolio, which will create further opportunities to share teams across properties and enable additional self-service options for residents. This, along with other ancillary income, should lead to total other income growth of 30 basis points excluding bad debt. As we sit here today, we like our positioning and look forward to capturing the opportunities the spring leasing season brings, which will help frame pricing power for the full year. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results. With that, I will turn the call over to Alec, to walk through our capital allocation activities and the transaction market. Yes. Hi, Steve. This is, Michael. I'll start. Maybe Bob can come over the top. So, I think when you look at the building blocks for the guidance, you need to realize, one, we're giving you a range, and there's a lot of different ways you can get there, but it's really the top level themes that underline and pin those midpoint assumptions. So, when we thought about new lease change, we started with the fact that we know the job growth is moderating this year, and, therefore, we would expect market rents or asking rents just to be kind of less than normal across the large majority of our markets. So we kind of model a normal seasonal slope for our kind of rent trend to build, and then we plug that in and we say, okay, what does that equate to? And right now, across our market, it's balancing out to basically be about flat on new lease change for the full year. Some of our markets are still positive. Some of our markets are still positive three, and some of the markets are still coming in at a negative growth through the year. But I think when you start to pull on any one of those, you need to go back to the top level themes and ask yourself, okay, what's really changing? So, if there's a material shift in job growth, sure. I think we would experience more pressure than we underlined in that the midpoint of our range. But again, it's, when does that happen in the year? And where are we? Because today, I'll tell you, we have taking a defensive position. We're starting the year with pretty strong occupancy that really gives us some confidence heading into the spring leasing season, and we'll just see kind of what pricing power emerges from that. Yes. Hey, Jeff. This is Michael. So I'll start. And just specific to the Seattle and the supply that we see, it is back half loaded for us in the market with basically, a lot of concentration in Redmond as well as the city of Seattle. So for us, like, the peak is what we expect to experience is going to be somewhere in that back half of this year. And you could already see the starts coming way down. So, I think the level of competitive pressure that we face in \u201825 and Seattle will be less than what we're facing in \u201824. Relative to the Sunbelts, I mean, this is a great question because it's going to take a while to absorb the units that are coming to this market, and the supply that we look at is fairly constant across many of the Sunbelt markets all year long by quarter, which tells us that and what I said in the prepared remarks that we expect to feel this pressure at our assets all year long. I think as you turn the corner and you get into \u201825, you're going to start to see that supply number slow down, but you are still going to have a little bit of the overhang of the pressure from the units that were delivered to the market in \u201824. Yes. I mean, I think we expect these markets to be volatile this year. And just starting off the year right now, I got both markets at 96%. Yes, we issued a lot of concessions in fourth quarter to get there, but the fact that we got there shows us there is demand in the marketplace. And as we think about even, like, the new lease change. So, both of those markets reported in December about a negative 8% new lease change. When you look at the January results, they're now both at about a negative 3.5%. So, it's a pretty material shift. So, the setup heading into the spring leasing season is really good, but we've been there before, and we've seen those markets kind of hit a pause and then kind of retrench a little bit. So, that's why we're just being a little cautious. We're going to wait till we see probably a couple consecutive quarters of improving fundamentals before we kind of change some of our long-term modeling on those markets. The other thing I would just add besides the value proposition of San Francisco is Seattle benefits from having, like, the lowest rent to income ratios out of all of our coastal markets. So, we just see this opportunity and the fundamentals for those markets to recover. It's just like Mark said, it's hard to pinpoint when. Yes. Hi, Brad. This is Michael. So, I think in the prepared remarks, I was saying we saw just that the overall market level, there was what I would describe as just like rent fatigue where you started to see, certain types of units, one bedrooms, all of a sudden hit a price point at, like, $4,000. And it just kind of the activity level slowed. The renewal conversations became a little bit, more challenging. So, I would say we still expect pretty good growth out of New York in 2024. We're just saying we're tempering those expectations a little bit. The fundamentals there would all suggest that you have pretty good pricing power all year long because you have almost little to no competitive supply in Manhattan. You've got good demand drivers, in those markets, but I just think we're realistic that we've had two really good years of rent growth of rate growth that we're just kind of saying, okay. Let's just take a pause on that, and let's wait till the spring leasing season shows us, exactly what the market's willing to absorb. Yes, Alex. This is Michael. So, yes, I think it's a great question. And what I could tell you right now is that the quotes for the next 90 days have already been issued. We do expect to continue to renew about 55% to 60% of our residents, and achieve approximately anywhere between a 4% and 4.5% growth off of about 6% quotes that are out in the marketplace. You got to remember in the last couple of years, I mean, we put a lot of effort into this renewal process. We've centralized our renewal negotiations. That's really helped us navigate, the negotiation conversations with residents. We're leveraging all new processes in both the quote generation as well as the negotiations. We're layering in data science to help enhance some of these results. And right now, we do expect renewal performance to be fairly stable, but we have modeled for further deceleration, like, later in the year. So, the full year is expected to come in just over 4%, which is still a pretty solid growth, but we do expect to see some deceleration. And I think when you look at the spreads right now that you see in the markets with new lease change or market pricing and renewals. Sure, there's more stickiness when it comes to the renewals, and we have a lot of great rich history and data going all the way back to, like, 2006. That shows us that even when markets are dislocating, and I could use a San Francisco back in, like, 2016 where it was just getting a lot of new supply right on top of us. That market held up pretty well from the renewal standpoint and landed somewhere in that back half of the year with about 2% averages. So, it's not uncommon to see these spreads in the marketplaces. And the other thing, I guess, I would point out is we start getting into \u201824, our concession use was elevated back in \u201823. So, I can renew a lot of these residents flat in some of these expansion markets or Seattle and San Francisco and still walk away with a 6%, 8% increase on renewal. So, it kind of takes away some of the spread that you're looking at and why we have so much but in that renewal number being right around 4%. Yes. Alex, this is Michael. I'll start. Maybe somebody can layer on top of that. I think this is really a market and submarket kind of look. So, it really just depends as what is the spread, how much is Brooklyn's rent compared to Manhattan, what is that trade-off, decision to happen. So, I don't know that I'd say I have more pricing power today than I have had historically. I would say we have really good processes in place today that help us navigate through these situations. And each market is going to deliver different rate growth based on a whole lot of factors that go into the strengths of markets. And as we look for, 2024, all I can say is that the setup feels pretty good. Yes, it's like normal. The rents are doing what they seasonally should be doing, sequentially building each week. Our application volume is sequentially building each week. I think we need to see that momentum in that early part of the spring leasing season to really be able to answer that question and tell you, do I feel like I got more pricing power or less than historical times. Yes. Hi, John. This is Michael. I could start with that. So, I mean, I think as you look at this and I cited before just the improvement that we saw in San Francisco and Seattle coming off of December and into January with the new lease trends going from, like, a minus 8% in December down to, like, the minus 3.5%? The portfolio itself was at minus 5.7% for new lease change in December and is now in January that we put in the release at a minus 3.7%, the expectations clearly is that you could see with sequential rents improving each week, that number is going to continue to drop, as you work your way through the quarter. So, on the renewal side, it's a little bit of the opposite story. You saw renewals were a 5.2% in the month of December, and in the release, we have January at the 4.9%. The quotes are out there, but we do expect this renewal number to keep trending down as we work our way through. Somewhere in that 4% to 4.5% range is what we expect to achieve off the quotes that are in the marketplace. So, I think you're going to see the interplay between these to shift a little bit where you're going to have strength because you're going to have new lease change starting to recover and hopefully turning positive as we start off the spring leasing season, and we'll see if we keep this kind of momentum in place to do that, and you'll see the moderation of renewals, but still at a really strong number if we come in anywhere between that 4% and 4.5% growth. Yes. Hi, Adam. It's Michael. So, I mean, I think there's just more stickiness into the renewal stats that you look at this. And you're also coming off of a period of time, which is low transactions. So, there is a little bit of that in these numbers. I think as we think about this I mean, like I said, we have this data going all the way back in time. It's just not uncommon in the fourth quarter to see new lease change goes negative even in a pretty good year with rate growth happening in the marketplace. That new lease change goes negative and renewals stay positive. So, it is a really uncommon situation for our renewal growth to go flat or even think that it's going to be negative. And like I said, we've just put so much into our processes. We have so much good information and insights to it. We got a high degree of confidence. That being said, if there's a big dislocation in the market, right, even the deceleration I mentioned before could be more robust than what we've modeled. Yes. Hi, Haendel. It's Michael. So, let me just start by saying, that really the entire company has been focused around these innovation initiatives for the last several years, and we now have created this foundation that really is going to deliver long-term value creation of the portfolio for many years to come. With the materials that we put in that November investor presentation highlights this technology evolution of this platform, really has been focused on creating the mobility and efficiency in the operating model while the seamless experience to our customer improves. All in, we've identified about $60 million in NOI improvements with about $35 million of that already achieved over the past several years. The early stages of this was clearly more expense focused, and that shows up in our numbers when you look at the low expense growth. And that's mostly in the payroll and some of the R&M accounts over the last couple of years. Going forward, we've identified and we expect about another $25 million. In 2023, we delivered about $10 million in NOI improvement, and about two-thirds of that was on the expense categories, primarily in the payroll accounts, and a couple of million dollars of that was in the revenue front. Specific to 2024, we've layered in another $10 million included in guidance with about $7.5 million in other income accounts. And this is realized growth as the annualized number from all of these initiatives is greater because some of these are back half loaded, meaning I only get about half of the benefit this year. So, overall, I guess, I would just say is this operating foundation is almost in place, and you really should expect that the future years are going to continue to have more revenue enhancement opportunities. But the reality is, I mean, we're never really done with this pursuit of operational excellence. It's something that's wired into the DNA of our company, and I'm sure as this year goes on, we're going to identify new things for future years as well. Hi, Anthony. This is Michael. Can you ask that again? I'm not sure I'm following the absolute rent part of the equation. Yes. I think when you look at it on the new lease side because of the concessions that we're offering in some of them, I think it lowers, like, the net effective rate when you look at the absolute average of all the leases that we wrote versus the renewals. Yes. Hi, Linda. This is Michael. So, I think clearly job growth is one of the catalysts that does that. The migration patterns also influence that. So, where you see a lot more of your move-ins coming to you from within the MSA, that's usually deal seekers. Those are people that are responding to see in the concessions and either breaking their lease where they were to move into it. So, it just you just haven't seen, like, the sustained momentum that you would expect based on seasonal trends. I think last year, you saw some of those layoff announcements. You saw a lot of ambiguity around return to office where people were just waiting to see what their employer was going to do, before they decided to make any kind of relocation decisions to get nearer into where their offices were. I still think some of that exists in the marketplace today. But what we did see and what we see right now is that the setup in both of those markets has positioned us with good occupancy. We are starting to pull back concessions. The marketplace, still has concessions in them, and we'll just watch and see that build as we get in towards March and April to see what pricing power really looks like. But there's a lot of factors that are going into why a market all of a sudden kind of stalls out and whether or not it shows you sustained momentum more in-line with seasonal trends."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Despite an unsettled transactions market, we remain steadfast in our efforts to continue to reposition our portfolio by increasing our presence in markets like Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Austin and Denver and expect to see more opportunities to do so as the year progresses. As we underwrite potential acquisitions, we are always mindful of heightened levels of supply pressuring rents in our expansion markets and reflect tempered rent growth and concessions as needed in our projections. Currently, the transaction market remains unusually choppy with volumes down 60% to 70% compared to 2022 and down 40% to 50% compared to a more typical year like 2019. Nonetheless pressures on sellers to transact continue to mount as does the volume of new developments being delivered in these markets. New developments in particular are often not capitalized to be held for the long-term, and even with rates decreasing over the last few months, carry costs are high. Owners of stabilized assets will also see pressure to transact, as loans mature and extensions that were agreed to with lenders last year expire. Despite the short-term operating challenges in our expansion markets, we remain committed to broadening our footprint in markets that will see strong job growth and household formations over time and lower regulatory risks. As regards our own transactions activity, we didn't acquire any assets in the fourth quarter, but we did sell three, a small property in Seattle, one in the Bay area and one in LA. On average, the properties were 40 years old and total sales proceeds were $185 million at an average 5.8% disposition yield. While transaction volume overall is very light, we are seeing some opportunities to lighten the load of non-core older assets primarily in our West Coast markets. Since the beginning of 2024, we've sold two additional properties, one in Southern California and a small deal in Boston for a total of $189 million at an average 5.6% disposition yield. We've allocated a portion of the capital from these sales to the share buyback activity Mark just mentioned. With ample access to capital either through asset sales or debt issuance and a property management presence in our expansion markets, we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. In terms of anticipated volume, our guidance for 2024 is $1 billion for both acquisitions and dispositions, but market conditions will dictate whether we can hit or even exceed these goals. Turning to development, in 2024, will complete six new apartment properties with a total cost expected to be $624 million and consisting of 1,982 units with lease ups commencing for two of those projects in Q1 and four in Q2. Three of those lease ups all through our joint venture program with Toll Brothers are in Dallas, while the remaining three, two in Denver and one in suburban New York City are JVs with other developers. Given the timing for completion and lease up, we don't expect meaningful contribution to NFFO growth in 2024, but would expect these projects to contribute more to 2025 growth. While our suburban New York project will see limited competition from new supply, not unexpectedly our lease ups in Dallas and Denver will see substantial new competition. We acknowledge that the competition may be challenging and anticipate as we may have to adjust pricing and concessions to meet the market, our projected stabilized yields, which at initial underwriting were on average a mid six maybe closer to six. We believe these lease ups once stabilized and past the current supply glut will provide good cash flow growth and be solid long-term investments. Beyond these deliveries, we will be very selective about starting any new projects with a primary focus on locations where it's hard to buy such as suburban Boston. I'll now turn the call over to Bob. Hi, Steve, it's Alec. Thanks for the question. Well, as you stated, it's a pretty choppy market right now and there aren't a whole lot of data points. As you know, the NMHC, conference is going on in San Diego right now. So, I have some pretty current time information, which is really a reiteration of what we've been experiencing in the last few months, which is a standoff between buyers and sellers. Buyers generally looking for a 5.5ish cap and sellers generally looking for something closer to five. So, not an insurmountable gap at some point, but right now, it's hard to peg things. But, assuming things kind of land somewhere in between there at a 5.25. I think most people are shooting for an 8ish IRR and obviously it depends on the rent growth assumptions and the residual cap rate, but somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit less if they're going to be more aggressive. So, Eric I'm sorry. It's not Eric. Nick. Sorry, Nick. It's Alec. And, the IRRs don't end up being that different, if you assume that, sure, there's a glut of apartments in the Sunbelt right now, so the next couple of years are going to be tough. But after that, the start's already down a lot. The demand story hasn't changed. I think there's still these cities that we're interested in that some of which are Sunbelt cities, like Dallas, like Atlanta, like Denver and Austin, still our great job growth generators, still have a lot great long-term demand side story. So, I think you see a couple of years that are tough, but then you have a pretty good few years after that. And I think you run that through your pro-forma and you're roughly the same. The difference we're seeing on a lot of things that we're selling right now and why the IRR for us is lower in terms of the hold scenario and why we choose to sell it is a lot of older stuff. You saw that, we're selling 40 years old property and that have very high capital needs. And some of that has our ROI on it. Some of it, it's just preserving the asset. And, there may be a buyer that sees things differently, sees a little more upside. But in our case, we think the capital is better used elsewhere. So, in our eyes, it's probably a 7ish something or other, and we think that money can be redeployed better elsewhere. So, and, Jamie, this is Alec. I would just add, though. When you're in a market, though, that's got so much supply, and these are historic amounts, where concession levels start to get more than two months or, really excessive, I think everyone gets impacted, whether you're a B property or an A property. I can't see how you're immune, from some of that pressure. Hi, Rich. It's Alec. Well, we prefer simple if it's available, but if there's a good opportunity that would require us to participate elsewhere in the capital stack that would lead to us likely owning the property, we're wide open for that as well. So, I do think there's going to be a lot of fee simple stuff out there, though. So, we'll balance that out, but we're happy to talk to anyone that owns a while located apartment in the expansion markets, about any structures they have. Hi, John. It's Alec. Well, we are literally just starting up our lease ups right now, so we don't have a lot of data yet. We are assuming a month right now, but that could be flexible over time. And, those lease ups are three in Texas, one in suburban New York, which will probably see very little, of that kind of concessions, and then, two in Denver. No. I think we're good. I mean, we will be opportunistic, though. It's free of our company, and we'll keep looking for, chances to buy great real estate. Hi, Haendel. It's Alec. It's really impossible to peg that without knowing the specifics of the deal and the circumstances around it. But, obviously, we're very focused on getting compensated for any risk would take beyond a typical transaction. Yes. Thanks, Rob. It's Alec. There's almost no activity in the markets listed. I mean, we're we test from time-to-time. Not saying we wouldn't sell something, but right now, I don't, I couldn't tell you what market cap rates are because they just haven't been frayed. So, it is really frozen there. So frankly, we've concentrated our efforts elsewhere. No, I think all of the things that you mentioned are likely to happen. There is a tremendous amount of capital on the sidelines. These cities are still great cities. The cities themselves are doing a lot, particularly in San Francisco and Seattle to improve the quality of life. I mean, they're making some really serious headways. And as Mark, talked about, we expect them to recover as the jobs recover. But even absent that, we're at 96% occupancy. It's just investors sentiment's really negative right now, and, we think that there are better opportunities elsewhere, and we're frankly a buyer of what it sounds like people would transact right now. Anthony, it's Alec. I don't know if I expect to. I certainly hope to and I think we probably will, but it remains to be seen. But there's some things out there that we've heard about that might be interesting, and we'll certainly be very actively pursuing them. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\nMartin McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2023 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer.

These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.  Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Martin. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2023 results. As you can see from the press release and management presentation, the business continues to do well in most of our markets, with our East Coast markets outperforming our West Coast markets. New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., comprising a bit more than 40% of our net operating income are all having very good years and are meeting or exceeding our expectations. Our target renter demographic remains well employed. Unemployment for the college educated is at 2.1%, with increasing pay levels and a continuing high propensity to rent, given elevated single-family ownership costs, low for-sale inventory and lifestyle reasons like delayed marriage and smaller families that favor our business. We're also seeing lower levels of new apartment construction in most of our established markets where we have 95% of our net operating income versus the Sunbelt markets, a pattern that will continue for the next several years. Consistent with this view throughout the primary leasing season, our pricing followed a trajectory that was pretty typical for a normal pre-COVID year. And as you can see in the management presentation, on par with our guidance assumption, the normal rent seasonality would return in 2023. We saw our portfolio-wide rents peak in early August and then begin to decelerate as we expected. However, we recently saw a deceleration in pricing in San Francisco and Seattle that was more pronounced than usual seasonal patterns. The main culprit here seems to be a lack of job growth for our target renter demographic. Michael will have more detail on this as well as the building blocks for 2024 that are laid out in the management presentation in a moment. In Los Angeles, we are working through the impact of a drawn-out process to normalize delinquency levels and to reduce bad debt. We continue to make good progress here, portfolio-wide bad debt before application of rental relief funds in the third quarter was about 1.3% as compared to 2.4% in 2022. But the process is uneven, and it is lengthy. Evictions are now taking six months or more in Los Angeles versus the two months to three months prior to the pandemic. Given the underperformance in San Francisco and Seattle and the lumpiness and improvement in bad debt as well as the impact from the noncash write-off of a $1.5 million straight-line rent receivable in the quarter due to the bankruptcy of Rite Aid, which is a retail tenant of ours, we have adjusted our same-store revenue guidance expectation for the year to 5.5% from 5.875% at the previous midpoint. We have also adjusted our EPS, FFO, and NFFO guidance accordingly. Turning to 2024, the long-term health and outlook of our business remains positive, with favorable tailwinds that should support performance. While job growth expectations for 2024 are lower than 2023 levels, we'll continue to benefit from demand from a well-employed resident demographic, we think are going to rent with us longer, given the cost of single-family ownership and powerful social trends like delayed marriage and smaller families that I previously mentioned. We also see a significant benefit from lower deliveries of new supply in our established markets compared to the elevated deliveries in the Sunbelt markets over the next few years. Switching to capital allocation. While the overall market remains quiet, we did have some activity in the quarter. We sold a 30-year-old asset in downtown Seattle during the quarter at a 5.4% disposition yield as we continue to lighten the load in the urban centers of our West Coast markets. We also continued to invest in our expansion markets by acquiring two assets in suburban Atlanta. One property was built in 2019 and was acquired from a large private equity real estate player. The transaction is a 5.1% acquisition cap rate, including the impact of the mark-to-market on some low-cost debt that we assumed as part of this transaction. This property is located in an upscale mixed-use development, though we acquired none of the retail with a resident base having high-paying jobs at the large education, and medical employers nearby. The other asset we acquired is in Gwinnett County, with easy access to the I-85 employment corridor, and was acquired for $98 million. This asset is brand new and is still in lease-up, and we expect it will stabilize at a 5.4%-year two acquisition cap rate. The median home price in the desirable area where the property sits is $600,000 which assuming a normal down payment in current interest rates equates to an all-in housing cost at 2.5 times our pro forma rents. Median household incomes in the area and among our residents at the property are around $100,000, making rentership a good financial and quality of life decision. It is important to note that our 2023 acquisition activity was paid forward capital from our asset sales without incurring any dilution as we took a cautious approach to transaction activity given the pricing uncertainty and low volumes in the marketplace. We sold properties that averaged 30 years old, and that we expect will have more capital needs and lower go-forward IRRs than the properties that were acquired, which were one year old on average. We are well positioned to further our portfolio diversification by taking advantage of acquisition opportunities that we believe are likely to arise from the substantial development pipeline that is delivering in our expansion markets over the next two years.  And now I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the third quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets, our outlook for the remainder of the year, and some views into 2024, and that we included in our management presentation. We continue to produce very good results with residential same-store revenue growth of 4.4% in the third quarter driven by generally healthy fundamentals in our business and some improvement in delinquency, although not as much as we expected. The East Coast markets continue to outperform the West Coast. Demand and occupancy remain healthy, especially across our East Coast markets and absorption and our results in the Washington, D.C. market continue to impress. As I will discuss shortly, San Francisco and Seattle are experiencing more pricing pressure than we previously expected. Before I get to that, let me touch upon October leasing spreads, new lease, renewal and blended. The stats we published through October 27 captures almost all the months activity, and as we mentioned, are consistent with seasonal declines outside of Seattle and San Francisco. New lease change is negative, which is normal for the month, and will continue to get more negative as pricing trend, which is presented on Page 6 of the management presentation, continues to decline for the balance of the year. In a normal pre-pandemic year, by the time you get to December, it is not uncommon to see new lease change be negative 4% or 5%. Given the weakness in our Seattle and San Francisco portfolios, we will likely be slightly more negative than that. Renewal rate achieved should moderate slightly, but remain relatively stable and make up more of the transaction mix. Put it all in the blender and Q4 blended rate will continue to moderate. In terms of the specific conditions on the ground in San Francisco and Seattle, as we stated previously, we have had little to no pricing power throughout the year. However, the peak leasing season did demonstrate an increased volume of demand and some moderation of concession use, which led us to what we initially thought could be the beginning of better stability. Over the last six weeks, however, these markets have slowed more than normal, which has resulted in larger price reductions than seasonally expected, characterized by both declining rates and increased concession use. This is most pronounced in the downtown areas of both markets, though there are other suburban pockets experiencing pressure like Downtown Redmond in Seattle. The uncertainty of back to the office from the big tech employers, combined with their slowdown in new hiring is keeping a lid on demand. In order for these markets to fully recover, we will need to see the vibrancy that comes to these areas when the offices are active, employment increases, and residents want to enjoy the city lifestyle and easy commute to the office. Both cities are making progress on improving the quality of life issues, and we are seeing signs that a few of the major tech employers are slowly adding positions back, especially in Seattle, but the improvement in both of these areas need to accelerate in order to generate enough in migration to these markets, which will allow pricing power to return. While recognizing challenges in these two markets, overall, our business remains healthy. Even with these now muted expectations, 2023 is on track to deliver very strong same-store revenue growth with several positive trends that we expect to continue into 2024 and support our business. First, our residents remain in good shape financially with rent-to-income ratios remaining at 20% portfolio-wide. Resident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic stress remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. Overall, the job market and our residents remain resilient, which would expect -- which we expect to carry into 2024. Our resident retention remains very good. Turnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive housing alternative, especially in our established markets. In fact, only 7.5% of our residents who moved out, bought home as the reason in the third quarter which is one of the lowest numbers we have seen since we started tracking the data back in 2006. At this point, we are not seeing anything to suggest that the overall turnover rate in the portfolio will not remain low. As I mentioned earlier on the demand side, generally, the employment picture, particularly for the college educated, remain solid and supportive of continuing demand into 2024. So, as I already noted, the high-quality job creation machine in San Francisco and Seattle recently paused, but longer-term fundamentals support the potential future growth. On the supply side, overall, we are favorably positioned, particularly compared to those concentrated in the Sunbelt. We should benefit from less direct competitive supply pressure in most of our established markets while DC will be about the same and Seattle will have elevated supply in 2024. When looking at new supply as a percent of inventory, there are significant differences between the overall Sunbelt and our expansion markets -- as compared to our established markets. The average new supply as a percent of total inventory in our established markets is around 2%, which includes the Seattle market at 4.5% which is the only outlier both on an absolute percent basis and relative to historical norms. Meanwhile, the Sunbelt markets are forecasted at just around 6% and our expansion markets range between a low 4% in Atlanta and a high of nearly 10% in Austin, which will result in pronounced supply pressure. This shouldn't be overly impactful for us since only 5% of our NOI is located in these expansion markets and, in fact, may present acquisition opportunities for us as financially stressed developers sell properties. So, putting all of these factors together, our overall revenue outlook for 2024 right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets. As you can see in the management presentation, our embedded growth going into next year is trending slightly above pre-pandemic norms and loss to lease is generally in line. With bad debt net, it is hard to predict the exact amount of tailwind from improvement, but our view is that we will continue to gradually work our way back towards pre-pandemic levels. The eviction process is taking twice as long as it did pre-pandemic, and this speed is not yet sufficient to both clear the backlog and allow for new typical volume of evictions to be processed. That said, we see no decline in the credit quality of our resident and their propensity to pay. We continue to believe that we will see meaningful improvement in 2024. In addition to the tailwind from bad debt net, we expect to see some incremental lift from several of the operating initiatives that we have in place around renewals, parking, connectivity, and other income opportunities. Moving to expenses, which continued to trend in line, we would expect our 2024 same-store expense growth to be slightly below this year. We will feel continued pressure on the repair and maintenance lines with some of the new technology fees like Smart Home and Wi-Fi, although the comp period from 2023 is pretty high, so that will help offset some of that growth rate. Insurance is clearly in for another significant increase. And right now, we expect real estate taxes to be higher than this year, but nothing that will create too much overall pressure. Some of the growth in these expense categories will be mitigated by continued operating efficiencies in the payroll line being created from our centralization initiatives. Let me wrap up by saying that the apartment business continues to be good with favorable demographics driving demand and limited new supply in most of our markets. We will continue to enhance our operating platform to take advantage of the opportunities that the markets present while delivering a seamless customer experience to our residents. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results.  With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Michael, I was just wondering if you could expound a little bit on the October numbers on the new side. If you do sort of the -- I guess the implied change, if you stripped out Seattle and San Francisco, the number was only down 30 bps, but that kind of implies that those markets were down kind of high single digits to almost 10% in October which is sort of like a month-free or rents are down with some concessions. Are we thinking about that right? And I guess, just trying to figure out what really turned the market to be that south. And it sounds like it's really in the urban core as opposed to less in the suburban communities?\nMichael Manelis : Steve, this is Michael. So yes, you are thinking about it correct. When you look at the October new lease spreads and you drill into Seattle, San Francisco, and I kind of put the expansion markets in there as well, they are running in the new lease change rate in the high negative single digits. If you drilled into San Francisco and Seattle, I'll tell you about 400 basis points of that is driven from the increased concession use. So, you can almost look at that negative 8%, negative 9%, split it in half, and say half is from increased concession use. The other half is from rate.  Some of that rate decline is really a function of who moved out, when did they move in, but the rates are down about 2%, 2.5% in those markets on a year-over-year basis. And if we drilled in even deeper into there, it is heavily concentrated into those urban cores of both Seattle and San Francisco. But as I said in the prepared remarks, the suburbs aren't completely immune from it. When you went around San Francisco, we are using some concessions on the East Bay concentrated in Alameda. But when you look at the value of the concessions, we're up at like six weeks, call it, 55% of the applications receiving six weeks in Seattle and San Francisco, which is very different than what you see in the suburbs, which are running less than a month.\nSteve Sakwa : Great. And then just maybe a follow-up on the transaction market. Mark, you sort of talked about maybe starting to see some increased activity, particularly in the Sunbelt. I'm just curious where that transaction market is? Where is the bid ask? I know you're sort of maybe a little bit indifferent on cap rates based on where you can sell. But just how are you thinking about pricing? And how have you may be changed your underwriting?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Steve, it's Alex. So, it seemed like over the summer, things were settling down to, say, 5.25%, maybe even a 5.5% cap. The last 60 days have changed that a lot. With the spike in the tenure, it's really uncertain what the market is doing right now. So, you hear about transactions closing, but those reflect pricing from the summer, not from right now. So, we're all feeling it out. So, there are properties -- limited number of properties on the market. No one knows exactly what cap rate reflects what the seller is willing to give up and what a buyer thinks is appropriate returns. So, it's definitely upward pressure on cap rates. We're pricing things all the time. As we've talked about on past calls, we look hard at replacement costs, and there might be compelling activity.  And we just think there's going to be more and more pressure to sell over time where people are going to have to accept a new reality, particularly in these high supply markets, particularly people have exposure to caps or debt that's maturing and that there'll be more activity as the market kind of settles down over the next six months to nine months or so.\nSteve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. That's it for me.\nOperator: We'll go next to Eric Wolfe with Citi.\nEric Wolfe: Thanks. On your bad debt, if the court process had been as quick as you thought, I guess how much more would have bad debt been down from the current 1.27%? And once you're through with the bulk of evictions and court proceedings, where would that take a bad debt?\nRobert Garechana: Yes. Eric, it's Bob. So, had it kind of progressed as fast as what we would have thought instead of having, call it, a 1.27% in the third quarter, we probably would have been about 10 basis points ahead of that and would have trended closer? So, the trajectory that we were hopeful that we were going to get to. And what we're just seeing, as Mark mentioned and Michael also mentioned in their prepared remarks is that it's just taking longer, right? And so, as the residents are staying longer with us as they go through the process, we're incurring more bad debt overall. We do have excellent transparency and excellent visibility into who's where in the cycle. So, who's where in terms of where they are in court cases, who's awaiting lockouts and all of that stuff, but we don't have great visibility into when exactly those proceedings are going to occur. As Michael mentioned in his prepared remarks, going forward, we do expect that at some point, this will accelerate because the backlog from the pandemic era will be worked through, and that we, at some point, will be able to get back to that 50 basis points, particularly given the fact that the credit quality of our customer hasn't changed, but it's harder to swag where we're going to end up on a full year basis.\nMark Parrell: And Eric, it's Mark. Just to add to that. We certainly hope 50 basis points is where we end up. But I would say that the fact that in some of these markets, the process has been maybe more permanently elongated because of either right to counsel and funded rights to counsel in some of our markets and just general, more bureaucratic effort required to get through it, you may have folks, and that's what Michael was alluding to in his remarks, we aren't seeing more delinquency with our new residents. We're seeing what I'll call the normal amount. But usually, they'd be out in a month or two.  And now it's just taking longer, and that means they're going to hit our bad debt reserve. They're still leaving. But I just think again, we feel like the credit quality has not changed from all we can see, but the underlying bureaucratic process and regulatory environment has and it may be that we end up pointing to something modestly higher than 50 basis points going forward, again, not because the customer changed but more because the process did.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. That's helpful. And I guess that sort of brings up how much more would be just with the new normal of a bureaucratic process like that make it 50 and 70. But I guess my other question was really just on the loss to lease at this point in the year, sort of how you think that informs blended rent growth next year. Because I assume the loss lease will probably just go lower, maybe be like zero by the end of the year. You included it in the presentation, but wasn't sure how to translate that sort of 0.8% loss to lease in the October to some type of rent growth in 2024.\nMichael Manelis : Eric, this is Michael. So yes, the 80 basis points that we included in the management presentation, the snapshot as of October 15, and we're just giving you the historical context. So that number will kind of decelerate a little bit as you get towards the end of the year. But there's nothing that suggests that right now, we don't expect our loss to lease to be in a relatively normal place to start the year. In terms of how you fold that into the blended assumptions for next year, I'm going to kind of stay away from giving any specific guidance on '24. I think what I would look at is the hardest part of the piece right now is for us is that intraperiod growth rate. What are you going to layer in by market? And we're in the very early stages of this budget process that includes both a top-down and bottom-up approach. But I could tell you that we do expect like Seattle and the expansion markets to be pressured from new supply. We continue to see and expect the strength in the East Coast markets, and we'll model some solid growth in Southern California, driven in part by the improvements in delinquency that we just talked about. San Francisco has potential, but I think you could tell from the prepared remarks, we're going to need to see a few consecutive quarters of improving fundamentals like before we adjust the somewhat muted current expectations for next year. But if you really put all those factors together, you look at where that embedded range is, you think about loss to lease being in a relatively normal. You hold in the intra-period comments that I just gave you, it really does still put you in a place where we expect to see solid growth next year.\nEric Wolfe: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski : First question is on the transaction market. It feels like private market pricing, particularly in the Sunbelt has been very slow to adjust the reality of higher rates, but also declines in market rent. So curious in recent quarters, have you considered setting a complete pause on these one-off acquisitions in the Sunbelt? Or are you considering that going forward until more distress flows through the private market?\nMark Parrell: John, it's Mark. I'll start with that. I mean we have been matched funding that. So, this year, it was a pretty modest year for us, $350-odd million of buys and sells. And frankly, we have paused our acquisition activity. The deals you saw closed, they priced really in the early second quarter, and one of them went through a long assumption -- loan assumption process and the other one had a lease-up and an elongated close process. So, we really aren't buying anything right now.  What you see out there in the release is really that tail activity. We may expose a few more assets for sale. We're always doing that, trying to figure out where that market is. And continue to execute on the strategy of moving the capital around. But before we commit to your point to buy assets at this price, we're going to sort of let market settle out a bit or look for an opportunity to just obviously very good.\nJohn Pawlowski : Okay. Makes sense. Last question is on New Jersey rent control. So obviously, there's some media rumors out there about a few assets being subject to control. And so, hoping you can give us a range of potential financial impacts on these assets? And then is there additional risk working in New Jersey port your broader Jersey portfolio that we may hear about in the coming months or years?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks, John. So, I'll give a little color on that. I'm not going to be able to be terribly specific because it is pending litigation and giving you a range is something I'm just not able to do. But we are the only ones facing these sorts of issues, both public and private competitors of ours in Northern New Jersey have these litigation concerns. In our case, the particular matter you're talking about in Jersey City, there was a ruling in our favor actually a year ago that these properties, these two towers were exempt from rent control by an administrative entity that administers these rent rules.  The decision that was announced a couple of weeks ago was by a politically appointed Board that overruled the bureau's original decision here and we completely disagree with that. And we're going to go and litigate that in the courts and have our say there and try not to talk about it too much in the press, except to say, again, we think whether it's in Northern New Jersey or elsewhere in the portfolio, we follow the rules of the road. We feel like we comply with, whether it's rental control rules or notice rules or whatever they may be in all these markets, those rules are complex. They're ever-changing. We've got a great legal team, a great operations team that follows up on all that. So, I don't have any sense of an overhanging doom, but I think this is another sign of just political pressure that's manifesting itself in litigation in some of these markets rather than in just going through the process of trying to influence your public officials to change the rental rules.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb : And Mark, maybe just continuing that theme on the Jersey City. You and I have chatted before on the risks of tax-exempt deals and deals that have incentives that years or decades later could come back to bite. So, in thinking about this, do you still see the appetite for EQR to pursue deals, especially in politically charged municipalities, deals that have tax incentives as worth the longer-term risk? Or what's going on here is your view is, hey, when we underwrite these deals, even if we shave off a few points for the risk -- for the political risk, going after these tax incentive deals are still economically worth it.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. I go up a level and say political risk. So, when you look at these markets, it's more about us managing political risk in these markets and our feelings about regulatory matters. In New Jersey, I think, is a market. We are rational capital allocators that is probably disqualified itself from material additional investment by us in terms of development or new asset acquisitions because some of these regulatory things are coming out of left field. They're really not the result of incentives, these particular ones, incentives on construction. What was done is these were placed in a state where for a number of years, they were exempt from local existing rent control rules. And that's what this whole discussion is about. It's not about sort of a 421-A type question, just to be clear, but I get your point. For example, in Atlanta, almost everything built there has a tax incentive. That tax incentive is really well understood. We priced it in there at the beginning. We understand the cap rate and we understand what happens at the end of the deal in terms of the incentive going away 10 years in or whatnot. So I guess it's more of an indicator of these different lawsuits of political risk and places that I think for us and for others, will be less attractive to allocate development capital or acquisition capital and places like Atlanta where you feel more comfortable with political risk, and it's just really an underwriting exercise to price the tax benefit in the deal that the city did with good reason to try and encourage affordable housing in that market or at least buildings that have affordable components.\nAlexander Goldfarb : And then the second question, by the way, Mark, just speaking of political risk, obviously, rents being down shoots a hole in the whole yield star litigation argument. So, I guess, yes, there is a positive at our third quarter earnings but thinking about Seattle and San Francisco, those are two markets where the downtowns continue to suffer and have issues recovering. By contrast, the issues in the Sunbelt are really, there's a lot of supply this year, into next, and then that supply goes away.  So, as you think longer term, it almost seems like the resolution of Seattle and San Francisco, to your point, is political, and it's unknown for the recovery, whereas the Sunbelt is known because you can see the product delivering and that there's nothing behind it. So again, think about EQR and capital allocation, are you guys still comfortable in the belief that Seattle and San Fran downtowns will recover? Or at what point do you sort of throw up your hands and go, the traditional recovery isn't there, we have to think differently this time.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks. Great question. So, I'm going to start by saying the Sunbelt definitely will have a lot less supply in three years, but it doesn't mean there will never be more supply again. I mean it's proven every bit of the cycle, that happens again. So, I want to speak to San Francisco, and it's merit Seattle real quick and then sum it up here. But we've got to have a little longer-term perspective for us because we're long-term investors in these markets. So, a little background on San Francisco. I know you've been around the real estate world a long time.  This is probably the best-performing large market in terms of rent growth in the country over long periods of time. It's got the high housing costs we want, it's got these big barriers to supply. It's got often explosive high wage job growth. And it's historically been a super desirable place for our resident demographic to live, but lately, I admit a little less so. Prop 13 also helps us limit those real estate tax increases, and that's our biggest expense. So, there's -- the framing in that market is very good.  But it is a volatile market. And that's part of why we've been saying since 2018, we wanted to lower exposure. But you get paid for the volatility. So, for example, post-GFC, EQR same-store revenues in San Francisco, they were down over 2% each year for two years in a row. So, we got hammered a little bit there. But for the next five years, on average, our same-store revenue was up 9% a year. I think our shareholders got paid back for taking that risk and volatility. I think the conditions in the job market in San Francisco can improve pretty rapidly. It certainly -- along with Redmond, Washington, the center of the artificial intelligence employment boom that we hope is coming but I will fully concede there's an elongated recovery going out in San Francisco. And this management team is responsible. If it's responsible for anything, it's responsible for being optimistic. And some of the things we saw in the middle of the year in that market made us feel like that recovery was coming right now. We still have faith that will come. But in terms of capital allocation, we're going to lighten the load downtown. We've said that. We have been selling in that market. We even sold this quarter so far, an asset in San Francisco, but we like that exposure to the tech industry there. We still think it's the tech capital of the world. And the argument on Seattle is not a lot different. I mean it has been a strong performer over time. Again, when we look back on that market, we were down, gosh, 4% on average for two years in 2009 and 2010 after the GFC. And then we're up 6% or more for five years after that. So again, you get paid for your volatility. Seattle is a place where our balance is a little off where we have been saying and we have been moving assets and capital out of downtown and into the suburbs and you'll see us continue to do that but we like that market. So, I believe -- I think the management team and the Board believes in those markets. I think we are a little overexposed to San Francisco. We've been forward about that. A little exposed to the downtown areas. But longer term, we think that's where this demographic of high-wage earners who aren't going to lose their jobs because AI aren't going to lose their jobs because automation are going to get the biggest pay increases, can handle all this inflation risk. That's what we think these people are, so that's where we're headed with our capital. But I'm as impatient as you are to see those markets improve.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: We'll go next to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste : I'd like to get some clarification on a comment you made earlier in your remarks that it's not uncommon to see new lease rate declines of minus 4% to minus 5% by December. And given the weakness in San Fran and Seattle that, you expect you'll be slightly more negative than that. So, am I correct to read that you're implying that your entire portfolio, new lease rates that you expect to be minus 4% to minus 5% or potentially weaker? And then what does that sort of imply for these rates you're expecting for San Fran and Seattle by that point? Thanks.\nMichael Manelis : Yes. Haendel, this is Michael. So yes, just to give you like some historical context. So, when we say historical norms, I'm really just looking at like 2017, 2018, 2019. And to give you -- in new lease change would typically in the month of October, be like a negative 1.5% to 2%. November goes down to like a negative 3% to a negative 4% and December would be like a negative 4% or negative 5%. So right now, you're seeing we're putting up a number in October, that's a negative 3.1% because of the inclusion of San Francisco and Seattle and really the pronounced concession use that we have going on in those markets. So, as you think about the fourth quarter for us, I think our new lease change for the full quarter is going to be somewhere around a negative 4% but if you go all the way to the month of December, given what we're seeing, I don't know why we won't be a negative 5% or even slightly above that negative 5% in that spot month. But for the quarter itself, I would put new lease change somewhere around that close to negative 4%. Renewals have been really stable for us and really have been doing better than what we thought. We will hold somewhere right around that 5% net effective change on achieved renewal increases. And when you put those two factors together, that's going to give you a blended somewhere around 1.25% give or take, 10 basis points either way.\nHaendel St. Juste : Got it. And any color or any views you want to share on new lease rates for San Fran and Seattle?\nMichael Manelis : So, look, I mean we're running high single digits right now. I think San Francisco stays kind of at that level. And I think a little bit has to do with if you back up and think about what were we doing in the fourth quarter this time last year, we did have concessions in play in Seattle. So, we were like a minus 6% new lease change in the fourth quarter of last year. So, I would tell you, maybe we kind of just hold the line in this high single digit for the balance of the year in those markets.\nHaendel St. Juste : Great. That's helpful. And if I may, one more. I'm trying to get a better understanding of the range of reasonable expectation that we should have for your same-store revenue next year. You outlined in your presentation the earnings of 1.3% to 1.5%, which is helpful. But the new and renewals getting softer, blended towards 2% for the fourth quarter, negative new leases. The bad debt is improving. But further than you expected and occupancy, I think based on a bit of a tough comp. So, I guess putting it all together, I can't quite seem to get to the same store revenue projection for next year above the mid-2s? Is that maybe unfair or what maybe could I be missing or underappreciating.\nMark Parrell: Well, I appreciate the question, Haendel, it's Mark, but we can't answer that with any specificity. We -- just sort of sharing what we know at this time, we're in the middle of the budget process, which is both top-down and bottoms up. In places like Seattle and the expansion markets supply and close in proximate supply is going to matter. Other places we're looking at job forecasts and how well occupied we are. So, I think that's just news yet to be written.\nHaendel St. Juste : Fair enough. But maybe can I ask you about Rite Aid and how you think about backfilling those stores and if we expect -- should expect that to be a drag or maybe a tailwind to next year?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Haendel, it's Alex. We actually have a lease in place already. So, we're very excited about it. It's going to be a good user. It's going to be a great amenity for our residents and for the neighborhood. So, it's a matter of getting them into the space, and that's going to take a little bit of time through next year, six months or so and then they'll be in place.\nRobert Garechana: Yes. And Haendel, from a P&L standpoint, as Alex mentioned, there's two things that will go on to determine the P&L is just how fast those folks get in place, the new lease because that's when we'll start recognizing the revenue for them in 2024 and what that impact is relative to the write -- we had the write-off which you're not going to have again in our base year in 2023. So those two pieces in that rate of growth. But I would expect -- in all likelihood, it will be relatively flat because you had the impact in '23 of the $1.5 million write-off.\nHaendel St. Juste : Appreciate. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJosh Dennerlein : Just wanted to touch base on the same-store CapEx, you increased it again to $3,600 per apartment unit. I looked back like a year ago, I think it was like $2,600 per apartment. Just kind of curious what's going on there? What are you guys seeing? And if there's any shifting from like same-store expenses into CapEx buckets or just rising costs?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Josh, it's Alex. Yes, you're right. It did go up, but it went up for a variety of reasons that I'll go through, not related to shifting expenses into capital. It's really related to starting the year thinking that spending capital on our portfolio was a more compelling use of capital than acquisitions or development. And we had a big budget. I always handicapped the budget a little bit because things generally take a little longer its construction, things go wrong, contractors, misstates and through the first half of the year, we are right on track for that. We actually had a very productive summer, and so we ended up doing more work than I thought we would do. So, it's partially that. It's also -- we added in some ROI projects, specifically some solar panel installations that have a great return that weren't available to us until the middle of the year. And we did have some storm damage that carried through into the third quarter. And on top of that, we've had some smart rent installations that we've accelerated that added on top of that. So, we expect that next year, we'll be back more in a normalized spend rate. And again, it doesn't relate to any accounting changes.\nJosh Dennerlein : Okay. Great. Appreciate that color. And then I wanted to just explore the cadence of lease rate growth through October, I guess, particular the new. Was there -- as October was progressing, was there like a big drop off towards the tail end of the month? And then if there was, were you kind of doing that in response to maintaining occupancy? Or just kind of what's the dynamic playing out?\nMichael Manelis : Josh, this is Michael. I think I would back you up a little bit and say it's probably like that third week in September. And again, you're hitting a period of time which you see seasonal softening. So, it is not uncommon to see demand start to soften. And what we saw in that kind of later part of September specifically in the San Francisco and Seattle market, as things were trailing off, you clearly saw a market react very quickly with concessions increasing and rates coming down to basically get enough demand to hold occupancies. And that has manifested itself throughout the month of October with continuing deceleration, but it's not like the deceleration has been even more rapid through October. I would tell you it's kind of been at this level now for a while, but we do expect rates to keep decelerating a little bit. But the demand right now in those markets needs to be stronger in order to stop the deceleration rate. And we're just -- we don't have anything that would suggest that we should model that way right now.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. We've seen new lease rate growth fall quite a bit faster than renewal rate. So how long can the gap remain wide? And are renewing residents more aware of pricing and pushing back harder on renewals? Or are they just accepting the rent increase? Thanks.\nMichael Manelis : Yes. Michael, this is Michael. So, we are negotiating a little bit more, but again, that's not uncommon to do in the fourth quarter of any year. We have quotes out for the next 90 days. I think our residents are clearly aware of what's happening in the marketplace. You definitely have kind of more conversations being -- taking place within our centralized renewal team. We're negotiating. We have quotes out somewhere in that kind of mid-7% range, and we expect to achieve somewhere around the 5%, maybe it's like low 7s to mid-7 depending on the month that we have out there. But we have a lot of confidence that the spread you're seeing is not uncommon to see in the fourth quarter. If new lease rates typically go negative, our renewals typically hold up in that 4% to 5% range. So, I don't really see anything that suggests that the spread is not going to continue as we see it. And then as we turn the year, again, it's really more of a function of what happens with intra-period rate growth. But as you start the year off, you'll see us start tightening up some of the renewal negotiations, but we expect a lot of stability on that renewal front. And what we're still trying to figure out is how to peg that new lease change assumption for the year.\nMichael Goldsmith: That makes sense. And my second question is, in this environment, how do you think about your relationship with Toll Brothers? Is there a greater opportunity to push harder and deliver units into a more favorable supply environment in the expansion markets? And then along with that, have you changed your acquired yields on development? Thanks.\nMark Parrell: I'm going to split that in half and talk about Toll. It's Mark and I'm going to ask Alex to speak to our required hurdle rates on development. So, we have a great relationship with the folks at Toll. They see the same thing we do, that there's a need to moderate development in some of these markets. We have three deals delivering. One of them, we move forward a couple of quarters. I mean their -- Toll is everything we thought they were. They're an expert developer builder. They're doing a great job. Obviously, we're going to face those same supply issues in Dallas that everybody else is when these 3 assets get up and running. So, I'm not sure why we delay anything. I'm getting the asset up and running getting heads and beds, getting income, that's in our in the shareholders' best interest. So that's what we'll do. And we're just -- we're assuming that starting at the beginning of next year, middle of next year, we'll have all three of those development deals in the lease-up process. And we'll report back. But I wouldn't delay any of those. If you're talking about other starts with Toll and anyone else, that goes more to Alex response on hurdle rates.\nAlexander Brackenridge: Yes. And I think -- it's Alex. With the 10-year in the high 4s, you think cap rates have got to be in the high 5s. And you think that development yields have got to be mid-6s or high 6s. So, the challenge right now is just getting a project to underwrite with that hurdle. Construction costs are not going up like they used to, but they're not going dramatically down and rents are not booming. So, it's very hard to get to a number that underwrites and Toll understands that and so do our other potential partners and ourselves as we look at projects we might do on our own or with partners, it just very, very difficult to make the numbers work.\nMichael Manelis : But I want to interject one thing because there are a couple of development deals we're looking at now that we like, that are in markets in the Northeast. And the thing that really distinguishes them is the really hard places to buy. So, we look at these assets, they have the benefit of having certain zoning and electrical codes and other things that are beneficial. It might be to start that deal or start one or two of these deals, but we're being super selective. We haven't started anything this year. But we do have instances like that where there's an opportunity to build somewhere that you really can't buy in and where we like that exposure where we might be willing to move forward even if it isn't really high 6%, mid-6% return, but the return and the sort of overall IRR in the long haul makes some sense. So yet to come on that, but I do want to put that out there.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you, very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim : Thank you. I wanted to ask about Seattle and your comments today that seems like it's more of a demand issue and a lack of job growth versus last quarter, where I think you cited it was more of a supply risk and there was a lot of optimism on the Amazon return office. So, I guess my question is, has that Amazon pull faded and maybe disappointed as far as drawing in employees and some of the peers? And when do you expect the supply to peak in Downtown Seattle?\nMichael Manelis : John, this is Michael. So, I think last quarter, what you heard us speaking to is with Amazon's return to the office mandate, you did see South Lake Union's occupancy tick up. You saw the demand pick up. It wasn't in migration from outside the MSA, it was just pulling people back in from further out within the MSA into that specific area. And in South Lake Union, we did have some new lease-ups. Those lease-ups did feel like they were getting kind of their application volume through. So, you saw concession use really kind of pull back a little bit or stay stable. So, the pressure we felt was a little bit less in that specific area. If you fast forward into next year, Seattle is going to have elevated supply, and that supply is going to be concentrated in the city of Seattle, and we are going to feel that specifically in like a micro submarket of like Downtown Redmond where we happen to have six properties, five of which are really a product that will compete head-to-head with that supply. So, in terms of like how to think about when that pressure is coming to us next year, I don't have the breakout for the new leasing stats by quarter. But I do know that it's not like Q1 is not when we're expecting to feel it. I think we have a little bit of a ramp-up period, but we do expect outside pressure in that market.\nJohn Kim : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Mark, one of your answers, you mentioned that acquisitions are in pause for now. I was wondering if there was a cap rate or spread to your cost of capital over the 10-year that you would be looking to transact at? Or is it more about the timing and the volume activity anticipated over the next six months to nine months and for selling in the market?\nMark Parrell: We remain open for business and acquisitions. We're underwriting deals. They just have to make sense relative to our cost of capital. We're looking for a discount to current replacement cost. So, it is right now at a pause because the market isn't offering us that opportunity. And usually, it happens that there's a whole bunch of deals that people have signed up and everyone just close them at the end of the year, and that's not what's going on there. So there likely isn't going to be a lot more exposed for sale until the beginning of next year.  So, I'm not sure this situation is going to change much. Like I don't know that Alex and I and the Board are going to make big pronouncements about acquisitions in the next couple of months because there just won't be much to action on. But we're hopeful next year, you start to see folks that look at the higher for longer scenario on interest rates that maybe see some pressure on NOI and especially in the Sunbelt markets, and maybe are more open to selling and folks like us that are more open to buying. The last point to make is what is our source of capital for that. If we're able to sell our assets in some of these over -- sort of over concentrated coastal areas that we like general exposure, but we're a little out of balance, if that's the fuel, then we'll be thinking a lot about the degree or not of dilution between those two. If we're borrowing money, we're going to think a lot about not just the beginning cap rate, but where it can reasonably go over the next few years. But right now, I think we'd be borrowers around 6.4% or so on 10 years, and that's a pretty significant hurdle. So those are the kind of things we're thinking about over there. Is that helpful framing for you?\nJohn Kim : Thank you, so much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman : Great. Thank you, for taking my question. I guess sticking with acquisitions, what is your appetite as you think about your target markets? I mean what is your appetite to do something big? Are there -- as you look at the portfolios that are out there, are there anything that you think would be particularly interesting? Or do you think the game plan will be kind of singles and doubles as you sell out of more noncore?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Jamie, it's Alex. We're open to anything. The bigger is great for us. If the pricing makes sense and if the locations and the quality of the assets are good enough. And that's generally been the challenge with some of the portfolios we've seen over the last couple of years is that the mix of properties and locations just aren't compelling enough. So, we have been targeting one-offs, and we'll do that as well. But something big comes up, we'll certainly pursue it. But in the meantime, there's going to be a lot of product coming to the market at some point. And we really primed up for that, and we're excited to take advantage of that opportunity.\nMark Parrell: Just to add, I mean, in 2021, the last time the market was open full blast, I mean, Alex bought and his team, more than $1.7 billion of assets, almost entirely in those expansion markets and a little bit in suburbs of Seattle and Boston. So, we are capable of hitting a lot of singles and scoring a lot of runs by doing that. So, we're happy to acquire in small dribs and drabs if that gets us to our goal. But as Alex said, we're open to portfolios, but they just need to make some sense. And a lot of what we've seen, you're getting three things you like and two you don't, you're not really ahead of the game.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. So, I guess just listen to your answer, it sounds like there's nothing that would be a perfect fit at this point?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Yes. We're not looking for perfection to be clear, but there's nothing that's compelling right now.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. And then I know there's been some questions on litigation. There's an article out talking about a DC RealPage lawsuit and you've been named as a defendant. Can you -- probably can't say much here, but can you give us any color on that at this point?\nMark Parrell: You guess it right. I can't say very much. That just kind of came over the wire to us, too. We are unfortunately in a very good company with a lot of our public and private competitors are in that suit as well. So again, we haven't analyzed it. We haven't even been served to our knowledge. So, it's hard for me to have any real comment except to say it's not uncommon to have copycat lawsuits filed by other members of the plaintiffs\u2019 bar or by the states and the District of Columbia when you have a lawsuit like the antitrust case that's being litigated in Tennessee and Federal Court that's out there and gets publicity. I'm not sure it's a new risk. It's the same risk in a different place. And again, let us analyze it, and if it's appropriate to comment further, we will.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Rich Anderson with Wedbush.\nRich Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. A question to Michael. You mentioned the history of negative 4% to negative 5% by December. If you look at that same history, what's the new lease rate typically change to by the time we get to April or May?\nMichael Manelis : Rich, this is Michael. I don't have that in front of me right now, but I can tell you that it clearly steps up and it's got to be in the positive 1% or 2% range because it's just going to keep sequentially building as you turn the corner into the year.\nRich Anderson : Of course, that would be expected. I was just wondering if you had some specific numbers for December, I thought maybe I'd ask you about specific...\nMichael Manelis : I don't have that specific number by month outside of this fourth quarter. But I'd be surprised if it's not up near that 1% or greater number.\nRich Anderson : Okay. And then going back to L.A. and perhaps the opportunity cost of having to deal with all this litigation and so on, is there a common thread to some of these bad actors that maybe you don't want to sort of put them in a group publicly, but maybe that there's some cleansing that can happen so that you don't -- you say you can avoid some of this scenario that's perhaps bound to happen in the future? Is there a changing -- change to your leasing sort of documentation or your credit quality process to sort of avoid a certain sort of segment of the renting population on a go-forward basis? Or is it just...\nMark Parrell: Rich, it's Mark. I'm trying to answer that. I mean there are tons of rules about who you can and can't rent to. And California, as you sort of implied, as more rules than most, and we're certainly going to comply meticulously with all of those rules. But this is, again, an issue when you create this regulatory framework where delinquency is more expensive, you do motivate us, and we are using our data analytics tools and other means to try and determine whether our credit standards should be raised even further because now the marginal cost of delinquency, which is what your question was getting at, is higher. So, we need to decide whether instead of, call it, three times income to rent, we need 3.5. But we need to do that thoughtfully. We need to do that in a way that doesn't completely tank occupancy. So again, we're rational actors like all the operators are in that market. And we have the advantage of having a great team and a lot of good analytics, but we'll certainly comply with the law, but we're going to look really hard at is there a different cutoff, but there is no group of bad actors. There's not like some particular percentage that's causing this problem. It's more that the processing of delinquencies takes longer. So therefore, just the normal delinquency is in the building three months instead of two. And so now I have one extra month, that's real money, what do we do to address that? Maybe nothing, but maybe it is a change, too. But I think are already pretty stringent credit standards. And so, we'll see where we go with that.\nRich Anderson : Is there an AI application to this possibly?\nMichael Manelis : Yes. Rich, this is Michael. So, I guess I can just answer a little bit on that and tell you, as an industry, it is exciting. Mark mentioned a little bit around the data and analytics. But what you're seeing within our industry is there is a lot more available data around this. There are new kind of screening tools that are coming to the market, screening processes that do leverage kind of different data points than conventionally the industry has looked at. There's clearly identity verification tools that are coming into play, not only for the touring side, but the application side. And you're starting to see more and more of this alternative security deposit kind of programs come into play. I think all of these things together in the blender actually do help start mitigating some of what I would characterize as fraud or bad actors in the system.\nRich Anderson : That\u2019s great. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the earnings, which I know you guys put in from your slide deck, I always find the deck to be really helpful. I guess if I'm just looking at that 1.3% to 1.5% range, I'm assuming that's kind of your assumption today for what the earning will be going into next year, so on January 1? So just to confirm that. And then maybe just thinking about over the last two months of the year, what could kind of change that number, right? And maybe a focus on San Francisco and Seattle specifically, would there be some risk to that number? Or is kind of further softening in those two markets already kind of embedded in that embedded growth?\nMichael Manelis : Yes. Adam, this is Michael. I think right now, we put the range out there because it is hard to move that number much more than 10 basis points. And it is our assumption as to where do we land on 12/31. So, you start 1/1, what does that rent roll look like? And what is the embedded growth from the leases that you have in place. Typically, we wouldn't really give a range, we'd give a number, but you do have some volatility sitting out there right now, not on kind of the renewal front, the growth that we're going to get from renewals feel pretty stable. But you could see concessions tick up. You could see rates decelerate a little bit more or the inverse. You could see things pull back a little bit. And that's why we're giving you that 10 basis point spread. The midpoint of our guidance is PEG at the 1.4% which is the middle of that embedded growth.\nAdam Kramer: That's really helpful, Michael. And then maybe just a follow-up on the -- kind of the pricing trend seasonality charts in the deck. I always find this would be really helpful. I guess I'm just trying to kind of square this with the kind of year-over-year new lease numbers that you talked to. I think it's going to be minus 4%, minus 5% as we kind of progress through the rest of the year for new lease. I recognize that, obviously, there's seasonality here, right, things on a sequential basis are going to worsen. I guess I'm just a little bit surprised that the minus 4%, minus 5%, that should be a year-over-year figure, if I'm not mistaken, right? So, it should kind of already include the impact seasonality? Again, apologies, it's a little bit of a conceptual question here maybe, but just trying to kind of square the kind of seasonal versus sequential, I guess, kind of discussion here.\nRobert Garechana: Yes. I'll start and maybe Michael can augment, if you will. So, I think if I understand your question right, you're kind of looking at the pricing trend looking at the spread between the lines, and saying, like, how does that square with my new lease change? And I guess I would tell you to start on your new lease change. There is a lot of noise around mix, and we do all terms. So, we report all terms in our new lease change. So that means that you could have had a lease that was signed in August that was for -- at a premium rent that was for three months reset in October. And therefore, you're going to have a much bigger change than what would be reflected if you just looked at those lines and said, everybody is on a 12-month lease, everybody's on a year-over-year basis, and that does create a decent amount of noise. If you look and dig into the numbers, there. You also have some level of -- even though these are small as a percentage of total, meaning most of our leases are 12 months, there's enough noise in there and enough volatility in the transaction base to not make that comparison kind of apples-to-apples. What we do think is really helpful for the price -- in pricing trend and why we present it is just to look at the overall kind of directionality of where prices are going and where they are relative to seasonal trends overall. So, I would say the pricing trend is best suited for a directional viewpoint and the new lease change is really what's going into the revenue line and it's really what's supporting your GRP and your revenue overall.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Jennifer. I want to thank everyone for their time and interest in Equity Residential today, and look forward to seeing everyone on the conference circuit over the next few weeks. Thank you.\nOperator: Everyone else had left the call. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the third quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets, our outlook for the remainder of the year, and some views into 2024, and that we included in our management presentation. We continue to produce very good results with residential same-store revenue growth of 4.4% in the third quarter driven by generally healthy fundamentals in our business and some improvement in delinquency, although not as much as we expected. The East Coast markets continue to outperform the West Coast. Demand and occupancy remain healthy, especially across our East Coast markets and absorption and our results in the Washington, D.C. market continue to impress. As I will discuss shortly, San Francisco and Seattle are experiencing more pricing pressure than we previously expected. Before I get to that, let me touch upon October leasing spreads, new lease, renewal and blended. The stats we published through October 27 captures almost all the months activity, and as we mentioned, are consistent with seasonal declines outside of Seattle and San Francisco. New lease change is negative, which is normal for the month, and will continue to get more negative as pricing trend, which is presented on Page 6 of the management presentation, continues to decline for the balance of the year. In a normal pre-pandemic year, by the time you get to December, it is not uncommon to see new lease change be negative 4% or 5%. Given the weakness in our Seattle and San Francisco portfolios, we will likely be slightly more negative than that. Renewal rate achieved should moderate slightly, but remain relatively stable and make up more of the transaction mix. Put it all in the blender and Q4 blended rate will continue to moderate. In terms of the specific conditions on the ground in San Francisco and Seattle, as we stated previously, we have had little to no pricing power throughout the year. However, the peak leasing season did demonstrate an increased volume of demand and some moderation of concession use, which led us to what we initially thought could be the beginning of better stability. Over the last six weeks, however, these markets have slowed more than normal, which has resulted in larger price reductions than seasonally expected, characterized by both declining rates and increased concession use. This is most pronounced in the downtown areas of both markets, though there are other suburban pockets experiencing pressure like Downtown Redmond in Seattle. The uncertainty of back to the office from the big tech employers, combined with their slowdown in new hiring is keeping a lid on demand. In order for these markets to fully recover, we will need to see the vibrancy that comes to these areas when the offices are active, employment increases, and residents want to enjoy the city lifestyle and easy commute to the office. Both cities are making progress on improving the quality of life issues, and we are seeing signs that a few of the major tech employers are slowly adding positions back, especially in Seattle, but the improvement in both of these areas need to accelerate in order to generate enough in migration to these markets, which will allow pricing power to return. While recognizing challenges in these two markets, overall, our business remains healthy. Even with these now muted expectations, 2023 is on track to deliver very strong same-store revenue growth with several positive trends that we expect to continue into 2024 and support our business. First, our residents remain in good shape financially with rent-to-income ratios remaining at 20% portfolio-wide. Resident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic stress remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. Overall, the job market and our residents remain resilient, which would expect -- which we expect to carry into 2024. Our resident retention remains very good. Turnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive housing alternative, especially in our established markets. In fact, only 7.5% of our residents who moved out, bought home as the reason in the third quarter which is one of the lowest numbers we have seen since we started tracking the data back in 2006. At this point, we are not seeing anything to suggest that the overall turnover rate in the portfolio will not remain low. As I mentioned earlier on the demand side, generally, the employment picture, particularly for the college educated, remain solid and supportive of continuing demand into 2024. So, as I already noted, the high-quality job creation machine in San Francisco and Seattle recently paused, but longer-term fundamentals support the potential future growth. On the supply side, overall, we are favorably positioned, particularly compared to those concentrated in the Sunbelt. We should benefit from less direct competitive supply pressure in most of our established markets while DC will be about the same and Seattle will have elevated supply in 2024. When looking at new supply as a percent of inventory, there are significant differences between the overall Sunbelt and our expansion markets -- as compared to our established markets. The average new supply as a percent of total inventory in our established markets is around 2%, which includes the Seattle market at 4.5% which is the only outlier both on an absolute percent basis and relative to historical norms. Meanwhile, the Sunbelt markets are forecasted at just around 6% and our expansion markets range between a low 4% in Atlanta and a high of nearly 10% in Austin, which will result in pronounced supply pressure. This shouldn't be overly impactful for us since only 5% of our NOI is located in these expansion markets and, in fact, may present acquisition opportunities for us as financially stressed developers sell properties. So, putting all of these factors together, our overall revenue outlook for 2024 right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets. As you can see in the management presentation, our embedded growth going into next year is trending slightly above pre-pandemic norms and loss to lease is generally in line. With bad debt net, it is hard to predict the exact amount of tailwind from improvement, but our view is that we will continue to gradually work our way back towards pre-pandemic levels. The eviction process is taking twice as long as it did pre-pandemic, and this speed is not yet sufficient to both clear the backlog and allow for new typical volume of evictions to be processed. That said, we see no decline in the credit quality of our resident and their propensity to pay. We continue to believe that we will see meaningful improvement in 2024. In addition to the tailwind from bad debt net, we expect to see some incremental lift from several of the operating initiatives that we have in place around renewals, parking, connectivity, and other income opportunities. Moving to expenses, which continued to trend in line, we would expect our 2024 same-store expense growth to be slightly below this year. We will feel continued pressure on the repair and maintenance lines with some of the new technology fees like Smart Home and Wi-Fi, although the comp period from 2023 is pretty high, so that will help offset some of that growth rate. Insurance is clearly in for another significant increase. And right now, we expect real estate taxes to be higher than this year, but nothing that will create too much overall pressure. Some of the growth in these expense categories will be mitigated by continued operating efficiencies in the payroll line being created from our centralization initiatives. Let me wrap up by saying that the apartment business continues to be good with favorable demographics driving demand and limited new supply in most of our markets. We will continue to enhance our operating platform to take advantage of the opportunities that the markets present while delivering a seamless customer experience to our residents. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results.  With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Steve, this is Michael. So yes, you are thinking about it correct. When you look at the October new lease spreads and you drill into Seattle, San Francisco, and I kind of put the expansion markets in there as well, they are running in the new lease change rate in the high negative single digits. If you drilled into San Francisco and Seattle, I'll tell you about 400 basis points of that is driven from the increased concession use. So, you can almost look at that negative 8%, negative 9%, split it in half, and say half is from increased concession use. The other half is from rate.  Some of that rate decline is really a function of who moved out, when did they move in, but the rates are down about 2%, 2.5% in those markets on a year-over-year basis. And if we drilled in even deeper into there, it is heavily concentrated into those urban cores of both Seattle and San Francisco. But as I said in the prepared remarks, the suburbs aren't completely immune from it. When you went around San Francisco, we are using some concessions on the East Bay concentrated in Alameda. But when you look at the value of the concessions, we're up at like six weeks, call it, 55% of the applications receiving six weeks in Seattle and San Francisco, which is very different than what you see in the suburbs, which are running less than a month. Eric, this is Michael. So yes, the 80 basis points that we included in the management presentation, the snapshot as of October 15, and we're just giving you the historical context. So that number will kind of decelerate a little bit as you get towards the end of the year. But there's nothing that suggests that right now, we don't expect our loss to lease to be in a relatively normal place to start the year. In terms of how you fold that into the blended assumptions for next year, I'm going to kind of stay away from giving any specific guidance on '24. I think what I would look at is the hardest part of the piece right now is for us is that intraperiod growth rate. What are you going to layer in by market? And we're in the very early stages of this budget process that includes both a top-down and bottom-up approach. But I could tell you that we do expect like Seattle and the expansion markets to be pressured from new supply. We continue to see and expect the strength in the East Coast markets, and we'll model some solid growth in Southern California, driven in part by the improvements in delinquency that we just talked about. San Francisco has potential, but I think you could tell from the prepared remarks, we're going to need to see a few consecutive quarters of improving fundamentals like before we adjust the somewhat muted current expectations for next year. But if you really put all those factors together, you look at where that embedded range is, you think about loss to lease being in a relatively normal. You hold in the intra-period comments that I just gave you, it really does still put you in a place where we expect to see solid growth next year. Yes. Haendel, this is Michael. So yes, just to give you like some historical context. So, when we say historical norms, I'm really just looking at like 2017, 2018, 2019. And to give you -- in new lease change would typically in the month of October, be like a negative 1.5% to 2%. November goes down to like a negative 3% to a negative 4% and December would be like a negative 4% or negative 5%. So right now, you're seeing we're putting up a number in October, that's a negative 3.1% because of the inclusion of San Francisco and Seattle and really the pronounced concession use that we have going on in those markets. So, as you think about the fourth quarter for us, I think our new lease change for the full quarter is going to be somewhere around a negative 4% but if you go all the way to the month of December, given what we're seeing, I don't know why we won't be a negative 5% or even slightly above that negative 5% in that spot month. But for the quarter itself, I would put new lease change somewhere around that close to negative 4%. Renewals have been really stable for us and really have been doing better than what we thought. We will hold somewhere right around that 5% net effective change on achieved renewal increases. And when you put those two factors together, that's going to give you a blended somewhere around 1.25% give or take, 10 basis points either way. So, look, I mean we're running high single digits right now. I think San Francisco stays kind of at that level. And I think a little bit has to do with if you back up and think about what were we doing in the fourth quarter this time last year, we did have concessions in play in Seattle. So, we were like a minus 6% new lease change in the fourth quarter of last year. So, I would tell you, maybe we kind of just hold the line in this high single digit for the balance of the year in those markets. Josh, this is Michael. I think I would back you up a little bit and say it's probably like that third week in September. And again, you're hitting a period of time which you see seasonal softening. So, it is not uncommon to see demand start to soften. And what we saw in that kind of later part of September specifically in the San Francisco and Seattle market, as things were trailing off, you clearly saw a market react very quickly with concessions increasing and rates coming down to basically get enough demand to hold occupancies. And that has manifested itself throughout the month of October with continuing deceleration, but it's not like the deceleration has been even more rapid through October. I would tell you it's kind of been at this level now for a while, but we do expect rates to keep decelerating a little bit. But the demand right now in those markets needs to be stronger in order to stop the deceleration rate. And we're just -- we don't have anything that would suggest that we should model that way right now. Yes. Michael, this is Michael. So, we are negotiating a little bit more, but again, that's not uncommon to do in the fourth quarter of any year. We have quotes out for the next 90 days. I think our residents are clearly aware of what's happening in the marketplace. You definitely have kind of more conversations being -- taking place within our centralized renewal team. We're negotiating. We have quotes out somewhere in that kind of mid-7% range, and we expect to achieve somewhere around the 5%, maybe it's like low 7s to mid-7 depending on the month that we have out there. But we have a lot of confidence that the spread you're seeing is not uncommon to see in the fourth quarter. If new lease rates typically go negative, our renewals typically hold up in that 4% to 5% range. So, I don't really see anything that suggests that the spread is not going to continue as we see it. And then as we turn the year, again, it's really more of a function of what happens with intra-period rate growth. But as you start the year off, you'll see us start tightening up some of the renewal negotiations, but we expect a lot of stability on that renewal front. And what we're still trying to figure out is how to peg that new lease change assumption for the year. But I want to interject one thing because there are a couple of development deals we're looking at now that we like, that are in markets in the Northeast. And the thing that really distinguishes them is the really hard places to buy. So, we look at these assets, they have the benefit of having certain zoning and electrical codes and other things that are beneficial. It might be to start that deal or start one or two of these deals, but we're being super selective. We haven't started anything this year. But we do have instances like that where there's an opportunity to build somewhere that you really can't buy in and where we like that exposure where we might be willing to move forward even if it isn't really high 6%, mid-6% return, but the return and the sort of overall IRR in the long haul makes some sense. So yet to come on that, but I do want to put that out there. John, this is Michael. So, I think last quarter, what you heard us speaking to is with Amazon's return to the office mandate, you did see South Lake Union's occupancy tick up. You saw the demand pick up. It wasn't in migration from outside the MSA, it was just pulling people back in from further out within the MSA into that specific area. And in South Lake Union, we did have some new lease-ups. Those lease-ups did feel like they were getting kind of their application volume through. So, you saw concession use really kind of pull back a little bit or stay stable. So, the pressure we felt was a little bit less in that specific area. If you fast forward into next year, Seattle is going to have elevated supply, and that supply is going to be concentrated in the city of Seattle, and we are going to feel that specifically in like a micro submarket of like Downtown Redmond where we happen to have six properties, five of which are really a product that will compete head-to-head with that supply. So, in terms of like how to think about when that pressure is coming to us next year, I don't have the breakout for the new leasing stats by quarter. But I do know that it's not like Q1 is not when we're expecting to feel it. I think we have a little bit of a ramp-up period, but we do expect outside pressure in that market. Rich, this is Michael. I don't have that in front of me right now, but I can tell you that it clearly steps up and it's got to be in the positive 1% or 2% range because it's just going to keep sequentially building as you turn the corner into the year. I don't have that specific number by month outside of this fourth quarter. But I'd be surprised if it's not up near that 1% or greater number. Yes. Rich, this is Michael. So, I guess I can just answer a little bit on that and tell you, as an industry, it is exciting. Mark mentioned a little bit around the data and analytics. But what you're seeing within our industry is there is a lot more available data around this. There are new kind of screening tools that are coming to the market, screening processes that do leverage kind of different data points than conventionally the industry has looked at. There's clearly identity verification tools that are coming into play, not only for the touring side, but the application side. And you're starting to see more and more of this alternative security deposit kind of programs come into play. I think all of these things together in the blender actually do help start mitigating some of what I would characterize as fraud or bad actors in the system. Yes. Adam, this is Michael. I think right now, we put the range out there because it is hard to move that number much more than 10 basis points. And it is our assumption as to where do we land on 12/31. So, you start 1/1, what does that rent roll look like? And what is the embedded growth from the leases that you have in place. Typically, we wouldn't really give a range, we'd give a number, but you do have some volatility sitting out there right now, not on kind of the renewal front, the growth that we're going to get from renewals feel pretty stable. But you could see concessions tick up. You could see rates decelerate a little bit more or the inverse. You could see things pull back a little bit. And that's why we're giving you that 10 basis point spread. The midpoint of our guidance is PEG at the 1.4% which is the middle of that embedded growth."

            "content": "Thank you, Martin. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2023 results. As you can see from the press release and management presentation, the business continues to do well in most of our markets, with our East Coast markets outperforming our West Coast markets. New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., comprising a bit more than 40% of our net operating income are all having very good years and are meeting or exceeding our expectations. Our target renter demographic remains well employed. Unemployment for the college educated is at 2.1%, with increasing pay levels and a continuing high propensity to rent, given elevated single-family ownership costs, low for-sale inventory and lifestyle reasons like delayed marriage and smaller families that favor our business. We're also seeing lower levels of new apartment construction in most of our established markets where we have 95% of our net operating income versus the Sunbelt markets, a pattern that will continue for the next several years. Consistent with this view throughout the primary leasing season, our pricing followed a trajectory that was pretty typical for a normal pre-COVID year. And as you can see in the management presentation, on par with our guidance assumption, the normal rent seasonality would return in 2023. We saw our portfolio-wide rents peak in early August and then begin to decelerate as we expected. However, we recently saw a deceleration in pricing in San Francisco and Seattle that was more pronounced than usual seasonal patterns. The main culprit here seems to be a lack of job growth for our target renter demographic. Michael will have more detail on this as well as the building blocks for 2024 that are laid out in the management presentation in a moment. In Los Angeles, we are working through the impact of a drawn-out process to normalize delinquency levels and to reduce bad debt. We continue to make good progress here, portfolio-wide bad debt before application of rental relief funds in the third quarter was about 1.3% as compared to 2.4% in 2022. But the process is uneven, and it is lengthy. Evictions are now taking six months or more in Los Angeles versus the two months to three months prior to the pandemic. Given the underperformance in San Francisco and Seattle and the lumpiness and improvement in bad debt as well as the impact from the noncash write-off of a $1.5 million straight-line rent receivable in the quarter due to the bankruptcy of Rite Aid, which is a retail tenant of ours, we have adjusted our same-store revenue guidance expectation for the year to 5.5% from 5.875% at the previous midpoint. We have also adjusted our EPS, FFO, and NFFO guidance accordingly. Turning to 2024, the long-term health and outlook of our business remains positive, with favorable tailwinds that should support performance. While job growth expectations for 2024 are lower than 2023 levels, we'll continue to benefit from demand from a well-employed resident demographic, we think are going to rent with us longer, given the cost of single-family ownership and powerful social trends like delayed marriage and smaller families that I previously mentioned. We also see a significant benefit from lower deliveries of new supply in our established markets compared to the elevated deliveries in the Sunbelt markets over the next few years. Switching to capital allocation. While the overall market remains quiet, we did have some activity in the quarter. We sold a 30-year-old asset in downtown Seattle during the quarter at a 5.4% disposition yield as we continue to lighten the load in the urban centers of our West Coast markets. We also continued to invest in our expansion markets by acquiring two assets in suburban Atlanta. One property was built in 2019 and was acquired from a large private equity real estate player. The transaction is a 5.1% acquisition cap rate, including the impact of the mark-to-market on some low-cost debt that we assumed as part of this transaction. This property is located in an upscale mixed-use development, though we acquired none of the retail with a resident base having high-paying jobs at the large education, and medical employers nearby. The other asset we acquired is in Gwinnett County, with easy access to the I-85 employment corridor, and was acquired for $98 million. This asset is brand new and is still in lease-up, and we expect it will stabilize at a 5.4%-year two acquisition cap rate. The median home price in the desirable area where the property sits is $600,000 which assuming a normal down payment in current interest rates equates to an all-in housing cost at 2.5 times our pro forma rents. Median household incomes in the area and among our residents at the property are around $100,000, making rentership a good financial and quality of life decision. It is important to note that our 2023 acquisition activity was paid forward capital from our asset sales without incurring any dilution as we took a cautious approach to transaction activity given the pricing uncertainty and low volumes in the marketplace. We sold properties that averaged 30 years old, and that we expect will have more capital needs and lower go-forward IRRs than the properties that were acquired, which were one year old on average. We are well positioned to further our portfolio diversification by taking advantage of acquisition opportunities that we believe are likely to arise from the substantial development pipeline that is delivering in our expansion markets over the next two years.  And now I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. And Eric, it's Mark. Just to add to that. We certainly hope 50 basis points is where we end up. But I would say that the fact that in some of these markets, the process has been maybe more permanently elongated because of either right to counsel and funded rights to counsel in some of our markets and just general, more bureaucratic effort required to get through it, you may have folks, and that's what Michael was alluding to in his remarks, we aren't seeing more delinquency with our new residents. We're seeing what I'll call the normal amount. But usually, they'd be out in a month or two.  And now it's just taking longer, and that means they're going to hit our bad debt reserve. They're still leaving. But I just think again, we feel like the credit quality has not changed from all we can see, but the underlying bureaucratic process and regulatory environment has and it may be that we end up pointing to something modestly higher than 50 basis points going forward, again, not because the customer changed but more because the process did. John, it's Mark. I'll start with that. I mean we have been matched funding that. So, this year, it was a pretty modest year for us, $350-odd million of buys and sells. And frankly, we have paused our acquisition activity. The deals you saw closed, they priced really in the early second quarter, and one of them went through a long assumption -- loan assumption process and the other one had a lease-up and an elongated close process. So, we really aren't buying anything right now.  What you see out there in the release is really that tail activity. We may expose a few more assets for sale. We're always doing that, trying to figure out where that market is. And continue to execute on the strategy of moving the capital around. But before we commit to your point to buy assets at this price, we're going to sort of let market settle out a bit or look for an opportunity to just obviously very good. Yes. Thanks, John. So, I'll give a little color on that. I'm not going to be able to be terribly specific because it is pending litigation and giving you a range is something I'm just not able to do. But we are the only ones facing these sorts of issues, both public and private competitors of ours in Northern New Jersey have these litigation concerns. In our case, the particular matter you're talking about in Jersey City, there was a ruling in our favor actually a year ago that these properties, these two towers were exempt from rent control by an administrative entity that administers these rent rules.  The decision that was announced a couple of weeks ago was by a politically appointed Board that overruled the bureau's original decision here and we completely disagree with that. And we're going to go and litigate that in the courts and have our say there and try not to talk about it too much in the press, except to say, again, we think whether it's in Northern New Jersey or elsewhere in the portfolio, we follow the rules of the road. We feel like we comply with, whether it's rental control rules or notice rules or whatever they may be in all these markets, those rules are complex. They're ever-changing. We've got a great legal team, a great operations team that follows up on all that. So, I don't have any sense of an overhanging doom, but I think this is another sign of just political pressure that's manifesting itself in litigation in some of these markets rather than in just going through the process of trying to influence your public officials to change the rental rules. Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. I go up a level and say political risk. So, when you look at these markets, it's more about us managing political risk in these markets and our feelings about regulatory matters. In New Jersey, I think, is a market. We are rational capital allocators that is probably disqualified itself from material additional investment by us in terms of development or new asset acquisitions because some of these regulatory things are coming out of left field. They're really not the result of incentives, these particular ones, incentives on construction. What was done is these were placed in a state where for a number of years, they were exempt from local existing rent control rules. And that's what this whole discussion is about. It's not about sort of a 421-A type question, just to be clear, but I get your point. For example, in Atlanta, almost everything built there has a tax incentive. That tax incentive is really well understood. We priced it in there at the beginning. We understand the cap rate and we understand what happens at the end of the deal in terms of the incentive going away 10 years in or whatnot. So I guess it's more of an indicator of these different lawsuits of political risk and places that I think for us and for others, will be less attractive to allocate development capital or acquisition capital and places like Atlanta where you feel more comfortable with political risk, and it's just really an underwriting exercise to price the tax benefit in the deal that the city did with good reason to try and encourage affordable housing in that market or at least buildings that have affordable components. Yes. Thanks. Great question. So, I'm going to start by saying the Sunbelt definitely will have a lot less supply in three years, but it doesn't mean there will never be more supply again. I mean it's proven every bit of the cycle, that happens again. So, I want to speak to San Francisco, and it's merit Seattle real quick and then sum it up here. But we've got to have a little longer-term perspective for us because we're long-term investors in these markets. So, a little background on San Francisco. I know you've been around the real estate world a long time.  This is probably the best-performing large market in terms of rent growth in the country over long periods of time. It's got the high housing costs we want, it's got these big barriers to supply. It's got often explosive high wage job growth. And it's historically been a super desirable place for our resident demographic to live, but lately, I admit a little less so. Prop 13 also helps us limit those real estate tax increases, and that's our biggest expense. So, there's -- the framing in that market is very good.  But it is a volatile market. And that's part of why we've been saying since 2018, we wanted to lower exposure. But you get paid for the volatility. So, for example, post-GFC, EQR same-store revenues in San Francisco, they were down over 2% each year for two years in a row. So, we got hammered a little bit there. But for the next five years, on average, our same-store revenue was up 9% a year. I think our shareholders got paid back for taking that risk and volatility. I think the conditions in the job market in San Francisco can improve pretty rapidly. It certainly -- along with Redmond, Washington, the center of the artificial intelligence employment boom that we hope is coming but I will fully concede there's an elongated recovery going out in San Francisco. And this management team is responsible. If it's responsible for anything, it's responsible for being optimistic. And some of the things we saw in the middle of the year in that market made us feel like that recovery was coming right now. We still have faith that will come. But in terms of capital allocation, we're going to lighten the load downtown. We've said that. We have been selling in that market. We even sold this quarter so far, an asset in San Francisco, but we like that exposure to the tech industry there. We still think it's the tech capital of the world. And the argument on Seattle is not a lot different. I mean it has been a strong performer over time. Again, when we look back on that market, we were down, gosh, 4% on average for two years in 2009 and 2010 after the GFC. And then we're up 6% or more for five years after that. So again, you get paid for your volatility. Seattle is a place where our balance is a little off where we have been saying and we have been moving assets and capital out of downtown and into the suburbs and you'll see us continue to do that but we like that market. So, I believe -- I think the management team and the Board believes in those markets. I think we are a little overexposed to San Francisco. We've been forward about that. A little exposed to the downtown areas. But longer term, we think that's where this demographic of high-wage earners who aren't going to lose their jobs because AI aren't going to lose their jobs because automation are going to get the biggest pay increases, can handle all this inflation risk. That's what we think these people are, so that's where we're headed with our capital. But I'm as impatient as you are to see those markets improve. Well, I appreciate the question, Haendel, it's Mark, but we can't answer that with any specificity. We -- just sort of sharing what we know at this time, we're in the middle of the budget process, which is both top-down and bottoms up. In places like Seattle and the expansion markets supply and close in proximate supply is going to matter. Other places we're looking at job forecasts and how well occupied we are. So, I think that's just news yet to be written. I'm going to split that in half and talk about Toll. It's Mark and I'm going to ask Alex to speak to our required hurdle rates on development. So, we have a great relationship with the folks at Toll. They see the same thing we do, that there's a need to moderate development in some of these markets. We have three deals delivering. One of them, we move forward a couple of quarters. I mean their -- Toll is everything we thought they were. They're an expert developer builder. They're doing a great job. Obviously, we're going to face those same supply issues in Dallas that everybody else is when these 3 assets get up and running. So, I'm not sure why we delay anything. I'm getting the asset up and running getting heads and beds, getting income, that's in our in the shareholders' best interest. So that's what we'll do. And we're just -- we're assuming that starting at the beginning of next year, middle of next year, we'll have all three of those development deals in the lease-up process. And we'll report back. But I wouldn't delay any of those. If you're talking about other starts with Toll and anyone else, that goes more to Alex response on hurdle rates. We remain open for business and acquisitions. We're underwriting deals. They just have to make sense relative to our cost of capital. We're looking for a discount to current replacement cost. So, it is right now at a pause because the market isn't offering us that opportunity. And usually, it happens that there's a whole bunch of deals that people have signed up and everyone just close them at the end of the year, and that's not what's going on there. So there likely isn't going to be a lot more exposed for sale until the beginning of next year.  So, I'm not sure this situation is going to change much. Like I don't know that Alex and I and the Board are going to make big pronouncements about acquisitions in the next couple of months because there just won't be much to action on. But we're hopeful next year, you start to see folks that look at the higher for longer scenario on interest rates that maybe see some pressure on NOI and especially in the Sunbelt markets, and maybe are more open to selling and folks like us that are more open to buying. The last point to make is what is our source of capital for that. If we're able to sell our assets in some of these over -- sort of over concentrated coastal areas that we like general exposure, but we're a little out of balance, if that's the fuel, then we'll be thinking a lot about the degree or not of dilution between those two. If we're borrowing money, we're going to think a lot about not just the beginning cap rate, but where it can reasonably go over the next few years. But right now, I think we'd be borrowers around 6.4% or so on 10 years, and that's a pretty significant hurdle. So those are the kind of things we're thinking about over there. Is that helpful framing for you? Just to add, I mean, in 2021, the last time the market was open full blast, I mean, Alex bought and his team, more than $1.7 billion of assets, almost entirely in those expansion markets and a little bit in suburbs of Seattle and Boston. So, we are capable of hitting a lot of singles and scoring a lot of runs by doing that. So, we're happy to acquire in small dribs and drabs if that gets us to our goal. But as Alex said, we're open to portfolios, but they just need to make some sense. And a lot of what we've seen, you're getting three things you like and two you don't, you're not really ahead of the game. You guess it right. I can't say very much. That just kind of came over the wire to us, too. We are unfortunately in a very good company with a lot of our public and private competitors are in that suit as well. So again, we haven't analyzed it. We haven't even been served to our knowledge. So, it's hard for me to have any real comment except to say it's not uncommon to have copycat lawsuits filed by other members of the plaintiffs' bar or by the states and the District of Columbia when you have a lawsuit like the antitrust case that's being litigated in Tennessee and Federal Court that's out there and gets publicity. I'm not sure it's a new risk. It's the same risk in a different place. And again, let us analyze it, and if it's appropriate to comment further, we will. Rich, it's Mark. I'm trying to answer that. I mean there are tons of rules about who you can and can't rent to. And California, as you sort of implied, as more rules than most, and we're certainly going to comply meticulously with all of those rules. But this is, again, an issue when you create this regulatory framework where delinquency is more expensive, you do motivate us, and we are using our data analytics tools and other means to try and determine whether our credit standards should be raised even further because now the marginal cost of delinquency, which is what your question was getting at, is higher. So, we need to decide whether instead of, call it, three times income to rent, we need 3.5. But we need to do that thoughtfully. We need to do that in a way that doesn't completely tank occupancy. So again, we're rational actors like all the operators are in that market. And we have the advantage of having a great team and a lot of good analytics, but we'll certainly comply with the law, but we're going to look really hard at is there a different cutoff, but there is no group of bad actors. There's not like some particular percentage that's causing this problem. It's more that the processing of delinquencies takes longer. So therefore, just the normal delinquency is in the building three months instead of two. And so now I have one extra month, that's real money, what do we do to address that? Maybe nothing, but maybe it is a change, too. But I think are already pretty stringent credit standards. And so, we'll see where we go with that. Thanks, Jennifer. I want to thank everyone for their time and interest in Equity Residential today, and look forward to seeing everyone on the conference circuit over the next few weeks. Thank you."

            "content": "Yes. Eric, it's Bob. So, had it kind of progressed as fast as what we would have thought instead of having, call it, a 1.27% in the third quarter, we probably would have been about 10 basis points ahead of that and would have trended closer? So, the trajectory that we were hopeful that we were going to get to. And what we're just seeing, as Mark mentioned and Michael also mentioned in their prepared remarks is that it's just taking longer, right? And so, as the residents are staying longer with us as they go through the process, we're incurring more bad debt overall. We do have excellent transparency and excellent visibility into who's where in the cycle. So, who's where in terms of where they are in court cases, who's awaiting lockouts and all of that stuff, but we don't have great visibility into when exactly those proceedings are going to occur. As Michael mentioned in his prepared remarks, going forward, we do expect that at some point, this will accelerate because the backlog from the pandemic era will be worked through, and that we, at some point, will be able to get back to that 50 basis points, particularly given the fact that the credit quality of our customer hasn't changed, but it's harder to swag where we're going to end up on a full year basis. Yes. And Haendel, from a P&L standpoint, as Alex mentioned, there's two things that will go on to determine the P&L is just how fast those folks get in place, the new lease because that's when we'll start recognizing the revenue for them in 2024 and what that impact is relative to the write -- we had the write-off which you're not going to have again in our base year in 2023. So those two pieces in that rate of growth. But I would expect -- in all likelihood, it will be relatively flat because you had the impact in '23 of the $1.5 million write-off. Yes. I'll start and maybe Michael can augment, if you will. So, I think if I understand your question right, you're kind of looking at the pricing trend looking at the spread between the lines, and saying, like, how does that square with my new lease change? And I guess I would tell you to start on your new lease change. There is a lot of noise around mix, and we do all terms. So, we report all terms in our new lease change. So that means that you could have had a lease that was signed in August that was for -- at a premium rent that was for three months reset in October. And therefore, you're going to have a much bigger change than what would be reflected if you just looked at those lines and said, everybody is on a 12-month lease, everybody's on a year-over-year basis, and that does create a decent amount of noise. If you look and dig into the numbers, there. You also have some level of -- even though these are small as a percentage of total, meaning most of our leases are 12 months, there's enough noise in there and enough volatility in the transaction base to not make that comparison kind of apples-to-apples. What we do think is really helpful for the price -- in pricing trend and why we present it is just to look at the overall kind of directionality of where prices are going and where they are relative to seasonal trends overall. So, I would say the pricing trend is best suited for a directional viewpoint and the new lease change is really what's going into the revenue line and it's really what's supporting your GRP and your revenue overall."

With the spike in the tenure, it's really uncertain what the market is doing right now. So, you hear about transactions closing, but those reflect pricing from the summer, not from right now. So, we're all feeling it out. So, there are properties -- limited number of properties on the market. No one knows exactly what cap rate reflects what the seller is willing to give up and what a buyer thinks is appropriate returns. So, it's definitely upward pressure on cap rates. We're pricing things all the time. As we've talked about on past calls, we look hard at replacement costs, and there might be compelling activity.  And we just think there's going to be more and more pressure to sell over time where people are going to have to accept a new reality, particularly in these high supply markets, particularly people have exposure to caps or debt that's maturing and that there'll be more activity as the market kind of settles down over the next six months to nine months or so. Haendel, it's Alex. We actually have a lease in place already. So, we're very excited about it. It's going to be a good user. It's going to be a great amenity for our residents and for the neighborhood. So, it's a matter of getting them into the space, and that's going to take a little bit of time through next year, six months or so and then they'll be in place. Josh, it's Alex. Yes, you're right. It did go up, but it went up for a variety of reasons that I'll go through, not related to shifting expenses into capital. It's really related to starting the year thinking that spending capital on our portfolio was a more compelling use of capital than acquisitions or development. And we had a big budget. I always handicapped the budget a little bit because things generally take a little longer its construction, things go wrong, contractors, misstates and through the first half of the year, we are right on track for that. We actually had a very productive summer, and so we ended up doing more work than I thought we would do. So, it's partially that. It's also -- we added in some ROI projects, specifically some solar panel installations that have a great return that weren't available to us until the middle of the year. And we did have some storm damage that carried through into the third quarter. And on top of that, we've had some smart rent installations that we've accelerated that added on top of that. So, we expect that next year, we'll be back more in a normalized spend rate. And again, it doesn't relate to any accounting changes. Yes. And I think -- it's Alex. With the 10-year in the high 4s, you think cap rates have got to be in the high 5s. And you think that development yields have got to be mid-6s or high 6s. So, the challenge right now is just getting a project to underwrite with that hurdle. Construction costs are not going up like they used to, but they're not going dramatically down and rents are not booming. So, it's very hard to get to a number that underwrites and Toll understands that and so do our other potential partners and ourselves as we look at projects we might do on our own or with partners, it just very, very difficult to make the numbers work. Jamie, it's Alex. We're open to anything. The bigger is great for us. If the pricing makes sense and if the locations and the quality of the assets are good enough. And that's generally been the challenge with some of the portfolios we've seen over the last couple of years is that the mix of properties and locations just aren't compelling enough. So, we have been targeting one-offs, and we'll do that as well. But something big comes up, we'll certainly pursue it. But in the meantime, there's going to be a lot of product coming to the market at some point. And we really primed up for that, and we're excited to take advantage of that opportunity. Yes. We're not looking for perfection to be clear, but there's nothing that's compelling right now."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Martin McKenna. \nMartin McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's second quarter 2023 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com.  Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2023 results. As we work our way through the leasing season, the business is performing well with same-store expenses now looking a little bit better than we thought leading us to lower our guidance for that item last night.  As a result of this, and lower expected interest expense, we are pleased to again raise our same-store net operating income and normalize funds from operations guidance after raising same-store NOI and NFFO guidance just two months ago based on better expected revenue results.  In a moment, Michael Manelis will give you color on revenue drivers across our markets. After Michael\u2019s remarks, Bob will address the details of the improvement in our expense, and NFFO guidance, as well as our successful pending refinancing activity.  The overall theme here is that Equity Residential continues to benefit like most of the multifamily industry from solid demand, but with the more unique benefit of our mostly coastal portfolio being less exposed to the significant levels of supply just beginning to be delivered in the Sunbelt markets. We also continue to manage expenses well in an inflationary environment, which we expect will allow us to drive more dollars to the bottom-line than our competitors over time.  In terms of specifics, in the quarter, we continued to post strong same-store revenue results driven by good demand across our markets and rapidly improving delinquency in Southern California. As you may recall, we increased the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance for the year at 5.875% in May, right before the NAREIT conference to reflect these factors.  That in turn caused an improvement of 100 basis points in our same-store NOI guidance midpoint and a $0.03 per share improvement in NFFO guidance at the midpoint. These continued strong operating results speak to the durable nature of our business in a phase of some pretty volatile economic conditions. Despite the layoff headlines, particularly in the tech sector that dominated the news in late 2022 and early 2023, we see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic.  Also in places like Seattle, we are hopeful that the return to office mandates by employers like Amazon will drive incremental demand back into the urban areas of the city as commute times become intolerable for workers who dispersed far outside the city in response to COVID and are now required to be in the office frequently and as quality of life issues in these urban areas improve.  And while new supply is certainly pressuring the Sunbelt and Denver markets as I mentioned before, we are seeing moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets. Even in Washington DC, where we are seeing the highest levels of competitive new supply is being absorbed at a good rate and the market is performing well.  Switching over to the transactions market, that market continues to be relatively quiet. We do not sell anything in a second quarter. We did buy a couple of deals including a newly developed property in lease up in Atlanta that I spoke about on our first quarter call. The other acquisition in the second quarter is a 287 unit property located in suburban Denver, which we purchased for approximately $108 million at an acquisition cap rate of 5%.  The transaction market generally remains stuck between buyers who expect lower prices, given the huge shift in interest rates and the less accommodative capital markets and sellers who remain wedded to early 2022 values and by and large have assets that are still operating pretty well. So they feel no great compulsion to sell right now.  Our sense, is that sales will pick up over the next 6 to 12 months and sellers accept the reality of rates being higher for longer as floating rate loans with expiring caps reset and as developer capital invested in newly completed development deals becomes impatient.  Now a quick note on our capital allocation strategy. As we've discussed with you for the past few years, we continue to have a goal of having a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban and between Coastal and Sunbelt markets. We think such a portfolio will create the highest returns and lowest volatility over time. The recent issues caused by COVID in urban centers and the current issues in the Sunbelt markets due to supply, our examples of the opportunities and risks we wish to balance.  As opportunities present themselves in the Sunbelt and Denver markets and in select suburban, locations of our coastal markets to acquire or develop great assets at fair prices, we will be there to do so.  And before I turn it over to Michael, I want to take a moment to celebrate our 30 years as a public company. On August, 12th 1993 Equity Residential went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Much has happened in the past 30 years, We grew From about 21,000 units, and an initial valuation of $800 million in 1993 to more than 225,000 units across more than 50 markets at the peak leading to our 80,000 units and a value of more than $26 billion today.  On this journey, we acquired a number of other public apartment REITs, as well as some very large private portfolios including Archstone. At the head of this enterprise for all those years was our amazing Founder and Chairman, Sam Zell who we lost in May. Sam's guidance and influence are part of our DNA at Equity Residential and we will continue to run this company to honor his legacy of delivering superior long-term value to our shareholders.  We thank all of you for your support over the past 30 years and for your kind words regarding Sam's passing.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. \nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the second quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets. We continued to produce very solid results with same-store revenue growth of 5.5% in the second quarter that are in line with our improved May guidance expectations.  Results are driven by a continuing improvement in delinquency, along with a continued healthy fundamentals in the business. As with last quarter, East Coast markets continue to outperform West Coast. Our results to-date reflect our view that we have previously shared with you that pricing trends will follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory.  Generally, layoff announcement seem to have dissipated and our average resident remains in great financial shape with rent-to-income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. Resident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent often early indicators of resident economic stress remained below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations.  The overall employment picture continues to be healthy and young adults are choosing the attractive lifestyles available in our markets. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive proposition. In fact, less than 8% of our residents gave bought home as the reason for their move out in the second quarter, which is well below the 12% norm for this period.  Combined this with the overall favorable competitive new supply position, we face in most of our markets and we are on track for a good year in 2023. As a reminder, a combination of more difficult, same-store revenue comparison periods, including the absence of governmental rental relief this year and a reversion to a more normal rent growth pattern will result in more moderate, but still above historical growth in the second half of 2023.  As we sit here today in the back half of our primary leasing season, the portfolio is 96% occupied with good demand and resident retention. We expect a continued healthy trajectory for the remainder of the leasing season. Our portfolio-wide occupancy is being depressed by turnover in Southern California, primarily LA, as we work our way through the delinquency issues.  In the longer run replacing, these vacant units with paying residents outweighs the slightly lower short-term occupancy.  Now, let me spend a few minutes talking about market performance. So let's start with the East Coast. New York was by far the top performer for the second quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of more than 13%. We have very little competitive new supply in the market and our occupancy sits near 97%.  Demand indicators continue to be positive, making this market the expected top performer for the year Boston, produced slightly above 8%, same-store revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by strong demand across the sub-markets with our urban properties outperforming our suburban ones. We continue to hear stories of tough commute times for suburbanites that are resulting in residents coming back to the city.  While new Supply in the market is above the five-year average, the large majority of it is not competitive with our assets and appears to be readily absorbed. Heading down to DC, this market continues to impress with same-store revenue growth of 6.3% in the second quarter, despite a high level of new supply across a number of sub-markets.  The market just keeps going, absorbing these units at a healthy pace and delivering some of the best revenue growth in the portfolio. As an example, Reverb, our new 312 unit development in Central DC, which is currently in lease up is delivering weekly application volumes well above expectations allowing us to reduce concessions and push rate.  Occupancy in the DC market is just below 97% and we are optimistic for continued strong performance for the year, but recognize the increased volume of new supply that will be delivered in the rest of this year.  Now for the West Coast. Our Southern California markets achieved some of the strongest sequential revenue growth in the quarter demonstrating the early financial benefits of backfilling long-term delinquent units with paying residents. Unlike the Orange County and San Diego markets, which posted good quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, Los Angeles produced slightly negative quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.  This reported number however, is not indicative of the health of the market, but more noise from bad debt due to large rental relief receipts in the second quarter of 2022. When you strip this noise out, same-store quarter-over-quarter revenue growth would have been over 5% positive for LA. We are still seeing healthy demand in Los Angeles and have not felt any negative impact from the worker strikes in the entertainment industry.  Our direct exposure is not significant, but acknowledge it may soften overall market conditions in the coming months which could slow our ability to relieve some of our vacant units. In addition to the strike, we continue to see more non-paying residents move out, which is resulting in at least 100 basis point drag to occupancy in the market.  We view both of these issues as isolated short-term impacts to the market, as the strikes will end, and delinquency will gradually resolve itself, which coupled with the long-term demand we see as catalysts for next year above average market growth in LA.  Moving to San Francisco, a market reported respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth at 3.1%, which would have been 4.6% after adjusting for the impact of rental relief received in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, the San Francisco market demonstrated leasing velocity in line with normal seasonal trends, and met our expectations for the second quarter.  The South Bay, which represents 37% of our NOI in the market continues to be a bright spot. Prospects are telling our local teams that the area meets their hybrid work requirements by keeping them close for in office days and providing better lifestyle options and more space and access to the natural outdoor amenities.  Our recent resident survey tells us that 77% of our residents in the San Francisco Bay area are either hybrid or fully in office. In downtown San Francisco, we hear from our teams that new residents say that they are leasing to get closer to work. The good news is that the quality of life in downtown San Francisco continues to improve and the local government\u2019s focus seems to be showing some signs of promise.  While our pricing power in the sub-market remains less than desired and concessions are still being used. Downtown has been stable and allowed us to capture demand and regain occupancy to 96% in that sub-market. The overall sentiment in the San Francisco market indicates that the tech layoffs are mostly behind us, and there's a lot of momentum around AI, which keeps us optimistic on the continued recovery in this market.  Heading to Seattle, while there is vibrancy in the market with improvements in the quality of life issues, some return to office activity and tourism back to pre-pandemic level, the market continues to underperform our expectations. While net effective pricing in the overall market is now 2% below the March 2020 levels, there is a wide dispersion among sub-markets with the downtown Seattle well below the March 2020 levels, primarily due to the continued concession used in this sub-market.  Overall, Seattle has been a market that has struggled to deliver consistent strong demand over the last couple of years, as its tech-heavy workforce has had the flexibility to work from anywhere. But this market to fully recover, it needs to see more consistent, strong job growth with better quality of life conditions that will bring people back to the market.  The good news is that we are starting to see some positive signs in South Lake Union, which is a tech-heavy neighborhood in the City of Seattle, and this is likely due the Amazon return to office, which began in May. We are hopeful that this activity will soon spill over to the other downtown submarkets.  Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up about 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has been mostly in line with our acquisition performance and guidance expectations. Our portfolios in Denver, Dallas and Austin continued to be the most impacted by new supply like we discussed last quarter.  Meanwhile, Atlanta remains a bright spot with double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. In a minute, I will turn it over to Bob to discuss our operating expense performance and the balance sheet. But let me take a minute to discuss our operating platform, which is humming as we continue to reap the benefits of our focus on innovation and the technology evolution at Equity.  We are focused on the customer experience and the feedback we receive from our customers help us in developing our platform to drive superior financial performance and customer satisfaction. The insights we gained from our resident survey, which garnered more than 32,000 responses validates our strategy of combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution, while delivering self-service solutions to our customers.  Leveraging data and analytics on top of our resident feedback will create further opportunities to expand our operating margin. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment, and rapidly scale what works across this portfolio.  I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results.  With that, I will turn the call over to Bob. \nRobert Garechana : Thanks, Michael. Let me start with expenses before covering our financing activities. We reported same-store expense growth of 5.5% in the quarter. The main drivers of this growth were repairs and maintenance and on-site payroll. Repairs and maintenance growth in the quarter was driven by continued wage pressure, particularly from contracted services.  Payroll growth was mostly due to elevated employee benefit cost during the quarter relative to the same period last year. Without these costs, reported payroll growth would have been 2.6%, which was more in line with our expectations and reflective of the efficiencies we have been achieving from our various operating initiatives.  For the full year, same-store expense guidance we have lowered the midpoint of our range by 25 basis, points to 4.25%. This reduction is driven by expectations of continued low real estate tax growth due to modest rate increases and successful appeals activity, as well as significantly lower expectations for commodity prices, which are muting utilities expense growth.  These more favorable trends will be partially offset by slightly higher payroll and other onsite expenses stemming from the elevated employee benefit cost mentioned from Q2 and administrative costs from the expiration of the eviction moratoriums respectively. The revised guidance implies that significantly lower rate of growth for expenses during the second half of the year relative to our results through Q2.  We think that this is challenging, but definitely achievable given the easier comparable period from the back half of 2022 and the visibility we have into the items I just described.  Finally, turning to the capital markets and our 2023 refinancing activities. As we previously discussed, the company has an $800 million secured debt pool that matures in the middle of the fourth quarter. The debt originated from the Archstone transaction back in 2013, currently carries a rate of 4.21% percent and a portion of it needs to be refinanced in the secured market for tax reasons.  During Q2, we began marketing this opportunity to lenders and I'm happy to report we\u2019ve received significant interest from a variety of capital providers. In July, we selected lenders and entered into two loan commitments and locked in slightly below 5.25% rate for the $530 million that we're refinancing. This was approximately 135 basis points over the 10-year treasury at the time and was lower than what we would have expected to do had we been issuing an unsecured bond.  As you may recall, we've previously also entered into interest rate swaps to hedge this financing and those were settled for an over $25 million gain. When the gain is amortized over the life of the loan, it results in an economic cost for these financings of 4.7%, which we believe is an excellent outcome, given the environment.  Once these loans close, we would expect the company to end the year with approximately 8% floating rate debt, over $2 billion in immediately available liquidity and no real debt maturities outside of commercial paper until June of 2025. This, coupled with the lowest leverage in the company's history position us very well should any opportunities arise.  With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for question and answers. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  We'll go first to Eric Wolfe with Citi. \nEric Wolfe: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at your guidance, there's a nice ramp in earnings in the back half of the year. Just curious if there's anything sort of more one-time or seasonal or non-recurring on the expense side there. And if I were to sort of just take that as runrate, is that sort of a good runway to think about going into 2024 or again is there something that sort of elevated? \nRobert Garechana : Hey Eric, it\u2019s Bob. So, looking at kind of our NFFO for Q3 and Q4, there's nothing really in particular that\u2019s a standout on a one-time item. It's really the cumulative growth in NOI that you're seeing in Q3 and then pushing that into Q4 coming from same-store. Drilling down a little bit into that, I would say the only thing from a sequential standpoint that is maybe a little bit abnormal is the bad debt component.  So we're seeing bad debt improve in the fourth quarter and in the third quarter sequentially as we get back to a normalization. So, beyond that there isn't really anything sequentially strange about the - or one-time in nature about the growth for runrate.  As it relates to \u201924, I think it's a little early to talk about kind of \u201824, kind of where we are in terms of positioning. But what I would tell you is our numbers are kind of following that typical seasonal pattern that we've seen and same-store is really driving the operational results. \nEric Wolfe: Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned LA in the writers strike, actors strike. It doesn't sound like it's really impacting bad debt or rent growth piece. It could impact a couple months. Just curious what that sort of based on and that's already factored into your guidance, as well. \nMichael Manelis: Hey, Eric, this is Michael. So, I think right now, of course we're watching to see is anybody turning keys in breaking leases at a pace that's kind of above, which you would expect to see. And we really just haven't seen any impact from the strikes and our onsite folks are telling us just the overall direct exposure to it. It doesn't seem to be significant.  I think my comments in the prepared remarks were, you know right now we clearly are running occupancy about 100 basis points below normal for this time of year in that LA market. So the ability to lease up some of these units that have been vacant which, were from the delinquent - long-term delinquent residents moving out earlier in the year than what we thought.  We just think that if the strike is prolonged and keeps going on, it could just create a little bit of a pause in people's willingness to make decisions to move - to move into a new place. And that could impact just the overall demand profile in the market. But today, really not seeing anything and I'm not overly concerned about it. But it is something we just got to be aware of it. \nEric Wolfe: That's helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street. \nJohn Pawlowski : Hey. Thanks for the time. My first question is on the transaction market. Alex, just curious what range of pricing do you think you could achieve on kind of large urban assets in the central business districts as San Fran, and Seattle today just given the sentiment in the market was still pretty, while maybe proven still pretty down. So just curious what type of bids for those types of assets is today? \nAlexander Brackenridge : Hi, yeah, John. This is Alex. Yeah, there would not be a robust bid today. Larger properties are harder to sell. There's some contrary in money out there. But I don't know if it's willing to make a big bet. So I really don't have an exact number because I just haven't seen a trade. I think most people if they didn't have to trade, just wouldn't be willing to accept the number. So, it's almost theoretical at this point.  I think over time, that'll change as the markets continue to improve and access to capital becomes more normal. It's just such an abnormally hard time to raise sizable capital that I really think it would be a tough time. It was a distressed sale via pretty high cap rate and maybe not indicative of what the more or less distressed owner would be willing to sell at. \nMark Parrell : And John, it's Mark. Just to add to that, I mean, when you think about what supports apartment values there is certainly a lot of unallocated private capital. We've heard numbers up to $800 billion of private capital looking worldwide for real estate exposure. So, I think people, Chief investment officers, those kind of funds, just need to see some stability before they're willing to move.  I'm hopeful that towards the end of this year and early next, we'll be talking to you about some better numbers in those markets operationally. And I think that will also encourage capital flows. But I agree with Alex. I think it'd be really hard to peg a cap rate. It's almost like on a per unit per square foot basis, kind of conversation at the moment, but I think that's going to shift given the amount of capital on the sidelines and given our hope that operating results will improve over the next 12 months. \nJohn Pawlowski : Okay. That makes sense I guess, over the coming months or quarters when there is a little bit more on price discovery. Do you expect cap rates for these types of larger gateway trophy assets to be meaningfully higher than more suburban assets in what\u2019s kind of post-COVID environment? \nMark Parrell : Well, what'd you run into is what ends up being a really compelling discount to replacement cost. So, I think people will start looking in that and realize that getting in at a good basis in one of these good - these good cities, it's just really compelling. So I just really think that'll be a floor and will prevent too much of a gap from arising. \nJohn Pawlowski : Okay. Final question, Mark, just longer term as you see these cities heal from COVID, what - and not meant to be precise, but rough order of magnitude, what's the right urban or suburban mix in the QR portfolio five years from now on this call? \nMark Parrell : Great question. And what we've sort of thought about is we see ourselves as sort of 60% or so urban right now. And I get that number below 50 will probably be a goal. I think expanding into the Sunbelt markets, as you know, is a goal. And I think a great opportunity with the amount of product that's coming through. And I think in the suburban markets is some of our current coastal areas is a good idea too.  So my guess, John, is you'll see, sort of one-third of the portfolio in Denver and these Sunbelt markets five years from now. And you'll sort of see more of a 50-50 split urban, suburban. But we are a creature of opportunity.  And, if there was an opportunity to be to stay more urban because it was just absolutely compelling prices as Alec described, John, we'd certainly think hard about that. I mean, we're not - we feel like having a more balanced platform will give us better cash flow growth - more stable cash flow growth over time.  But you know the name of the game is buying right and if we can buy very well, we might move tactically for a while a different direction. \nJohn Pawlowski : Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for the time. \nMark Parrell : Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. \nSteve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about where you're sending out renewal notices. I know you provided some July data, but it looked like what is August and September look like and I guess, where do those discussions look like? And I guess, where are you seeing the most pressure on the new leases? \nMichael Manelis: Yeah. Hey Steve. This is Michael. So, for the renewal right now, you're right. We've got our quotes are out there for the next three months or so. It's been fairly consistent is what we've seen in the last couple of months. And right now based on conversations, we've been seeing through our centralized renewal team. We don't really expect to see a lot of variation.  We think we're going to continue to renew about 55% to 60% of our residents and achieve right around, a 5% to 5.5% kind of achieved renewal rate growth, which incorporates a little bit more negotiation and typically what you see is as you get into the beginning of the peak leasing season, our centralized renewal teams we tightened up that negotiation range, thought to like 100 150 basis points on our quote.  Now what we expect to see is, we get in towards the tail end of the peak leasing season. Just to kind of drop that off a little bit and probably negotiate about 200 basis points off of the quotes that are out there. But again, I think we remain really optimistic about the performance centralizing this team has really given us the ability to kind of pivot quickly and really deliver consistent results.  In terms of the new lease pressure right now, I think if you would just look at some of the reported stats and you can see kind of in Seattle and San Francisco where you're still doing that concessions in those urban centers, that's definitely weighing in on some of our ability to have a new lease change kind of go positive.  But again, I think overall, where we sit today in this leasing season, it's playing out kind of exactly like we thought where rents are sitting, where our new lease changes and the renewal performance and we just see kind of the markets reacting like they normally will through kind of the season. And that's kind of what's baked into the guidance that we have. \nSteve Sakwa : Great. And then, I guess, just on the development front I know you've got a handful of projects. I think one wholly-owned and several joint venture developments. Can you just remind us of kind of where those development yields are likely to pencil out? And I guess, Mark how are you thinking about the prospect of any future development?  If we're hearing correctly, merchant builders are starting to scale back their development teams. And hopefully over the next 18 months that development pipeline starts to shrink. But I guess, how are you thinking about that future pipeline freak you are? \nMark Parrell : Hey, Steve, it's Mark, and Alec may join in a second. I mean, we've got a, it's good to have a solid internal team, which we have and good JV relationships with toll and others and we see all this stuff. But as Alec has said on prior calls, it's just not penciling out. There's not enough of a risk premium in what is a risky endeavor of development.  So, for us, I think acquisitions seemed like a better place to invest capital for the time being. I think what could change there is just some sense that, are the rents have moved a lot. I doubt costs are going to move down in any material regard, but I think right now, I like the development pipeline being smaller. In terms of the yields we\u2019re looking at, it\u2019s mid to high fives on our existing portfolio.  The Laguna Clara deal in California, which is a one mile away from Apple headquarters deal was a little lower than that. It's an existing asset we\u2019re densifying. So there's less risk since we know the area so well. But beyond that, Steve, they're kind of high-five type of situations and to do a development deal, we need something to get into that close to that six range. And I don't - we may start a deal this year. We may not start anything we'll see. \nSteve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me. \nMark Parrell : Thanks Steve. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. \nJosh Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey guys. Thanks for the time. Michael, in your opening remarks, you mentioned operating platform initiatives and I think you mentioned some margin expansion potential there. Any early thoughts on where the margins can ultimately go and maybe over what kind of time frame you are thinking? \nMichael Manelis: Yeah. Hey Josh. This is Michael. So maybe I'll just hit on overall kind of some of the initiatives in the innovations and I\u2019ll let Bob kind of touch base on the actual margins. So, I think what we put out in our May investor presentation really just kind of highlighted the initiatives that we have keyed up. And this year specific to 2023, we have about $10 million included in the NOI guidance with about two-thirds of that being on the expense front as we keep working through kind of the innovations of leveraging resources across assets.  And right now, we're really focused on kind of teeing up the next round of initiatives and it's really more income-based and probably other income-based items that will really kick into gear in the back half of this year and start delivering kind of results into 2024.  Right now, we are literally right on track with our numbers and we feel really confident and about the incremental $10 million for \u201923. And maybe Bob, if you just want to hit on the overall margin impact to that. \nRobert Garechana: Yeah. So, from a margin standpoint that will all be a accretive to margin. I guess, I would say that in the states we talk we all talk about very different margins. So I'm going to talk about the margin I guess, that I think is most important which is the cash flow margin, which we highlighted at the NAREIT Conference. So, cash flow margin meaning after CapEx after expense at all of that. We're already running at a league-leading level as it relates to that cash flow margin.  And when you layer in the initiative, that Michael is talking about and that's inclusive of what you have to spend in order to achieve that that ROI and CapEx, etcetera, we think we can get a few percentage points of incremental increase there and that's what we're striving for. \nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. Appreciate that. And then, just the opening remarks on Seattle. It just seemed like it\u2019s the only legacy market you're facing with supply concerns. How long will it take to kind of work through that supply? \nMichael Manelis: Yeah, so Josh, this is Michael again. So right now, in Seattle, we\u2019re kind of actually in a low of going up against kind of head-to-head competitive supply. If you look at what's expected to be delivered and completed in \u201824, I think we're going to see that Seattle number kind of hinge up on us. And, it is something we're absolutely kind of watching and kind of making sure that those units will be delivered.  And when we create our guidance for \u201824, it's something that we will fold into that market. For us right now, Seattle, it's just been - it's kind of gets momentum and then it stalls a little bit. And then it gets momentum. So we really just haven't felt that consistent kind of strong job growth that's really needed to get us back on track and really get us out of that concessionary environment.  But to-date, it's not really the new supply that's been impacting us. \nRobert Garechana : Yeah, I just want to make a comment on Seattle. It's obviously for most of us pretty far away. So people aren't out there quite as much, but there's been an amazing renaissance in the city in terms of access to the waterfront. Very similar to the Big Dig in Boston. I think that's a very positive catalyst for quality of life in the downtown area where we have a lot of assets.  I do think there's an election coming up. There's been improvement in attitude in city government about livability and those issues. That's a positive. But I think Michael is, right. I think you're going to see a lot of supply, which on the one hand, Seattle is a market where actually the percent of rent to income is lowest with New York for us.  So there's an ability to pay more rent and there's a lot of high paying jobs and a lot of good industry in the Seattle metro area and has the city gets we hope more livable as people take advantage of these new Waterfront amenities. And I think, we feel good about Seattle and its ability to draw people in again, in scale and Amazon's just kind of called people back to the office.  So our folks on the ground say there is some momentum there in South Lake Union or Amazon has a lot of office workers. So we'll see where that takes this as well. But you asked a very narrow question. I'm giving you more. But I do have a sense of optimism about Seattle, but we have to navigate some of that supply the next really in \u201824 and \u201825 more than in \u201823. \nJosh Dennerlein: Appreciate the color. Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. \nJohn Kim: Thank you. You described the strong backdrop in your markets and potentially some demand catalysts going forward. But if we just wanted to isolate July, it looks like the blended lease growth rates had decelerated versus June. And I'm wondering if you \u2013 if that surprise you as well or you know, potentially it seems like it would have peaked now, rather than picking a month ago. \nMichael Manelis: Yeah. Hey John, this is Michael. So, I mean, I'm going to touch on a few different things here. Let me - I'm going to start with kind of the rent first and then I'll address the new lease change relative to July. And I'll tell you just we went back and we looked at like the last 15 years of our data and our pricing trend which is that net effective price for our units.  It typically peaks out somewhere in that late August to - or late July to mid-August period. And really the first week of August is kind of that most common time frame. I tell you, we've had really strong foot traffic, strong application volume. So, I'm not going to be surprised that if we don't see a few more weeks of slight increases in rates, kind of coming through our system.  And that being said, I mean, right now this pricing trend is up about 6% since the beginning of the year and it's right where we thought it was going to be. So even if we just peaked out at this level right now, it's kind of right in line and we will be just buying in terms of its flowing through the other stats. In terms of that deceleration of new lease change, I'd start by saying I would not read too much into any single month as this stat it's really better to look at over time.  And I think that what you saw in our release, it was like a ten basis point different. That's just a lot of noise for maybe who moved out and versus who moved in and where that was being done. And right now, I'll say that the new lease changes being more impacted by that concession used in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco.  But again, I think as we turn the corner and we looking at August I wouldn't be surprised if those not inch back up a little bit. We're really in this tight band relative to our expectations about new lease renewals and how that kind of translates into that blended new lease or the blended rate. So, I wouldn't read too much into any one month stat. \nJohn Kim: Okay. Thanks for the color. On the secured debt that you raised at 472, it looks like your unsecured notes with the similar term trades around 50 basis points above that. How does that spread \u2013 is secured is unsecured? How is that 50 basis points compared to historical? And if this continues with the secured market look more attractive to you going forward. \nRobert Garechana : Yeah, so let me break down - hey John. It's Bob. Let me break down a couple pieces. When you're comparing the 472, what I'm guessing you're comparing to where our unsecured are trading today. What you're incorporating in that is the impact of the hedges, right? So in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that we - when we issue the secure, we haven\u2019t issued it.  But when we lock rate on the secured loan, we are at a 135 basis points on the treasury at that time, which was, call it 5.25. How you get the 470 as you apply the gain that we got, because we give some forward, starting swaps at really attractive rates and that reduced it to 470. So what we should compare is really the spread that 135 basis points that I talked about in my prepared remarks to where the spread that would be implied in our unsecured.  And that's a lot more narrow. That's probably five to ten basis points hit or miss between either one. So they're relatively on top of each other. We think maybe we're, maybe five basis points inside on secured. But that's, one day's worth of trading activity could flip you and you be a parody. \nJohn Kim: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. \nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you can dig a little deeper into DC across the different sub-market. It seems, I could tell that pretty well, but there's also a decent amount of supply. So kind of what's your outlook for the back half of the year and into \u201824 in that market? \nMark Parrell : Yeah. So what's amazing about DC and even when you drill in by submarket, you really don't see a huge differential in our performance. And I think part of that is just when we talked about new supply coming into that market. They got such a great transit environment there that supply really in any one of these sub markets can pull from other areas. So we really haven't seen any deviation of the performance across the submarkets.  Now, when you look forward to the balance of the year, like it was back half loaded for deliveries. So we are aware that we're going to be facing more and more competitive supply. And it is fairly dispersed across some of these submarkets. But again I don't think we're forecasting to have like more pressure in one submarket than the other, because of that transit environment that could pull from everywhere.  The outlook for the balance of the year, it's still good, right? We're producing really strong revenue growth. Good absorption of the supply. It may soften up a little bit, but I think we still have this momentum coming in and I think it's positioned well for \u201824, even though you got another round of supply coming at you again. It\u2019s a market that's been demonstrating resilience and stability. \nJamie Feldman: And there\u2019s been a lot of talk around the government not bringing certain agencies back to the office. Is that something that you \u2013 that\u2019s kind of contemplated in the stats you are seeing already? Maybe those aren't really tenants that you see in your buildings or do you think that\u2019s a potential drag to comps? \nMichael Manelis: Well, it's Mark, and Michael may add to this. I mean, through the real estate roundtable, there\u2019s been a lot of advocacy around that of trying to get federal workers back on the job. I'm hopeful that it continues to push the administration put something out. It wasn't very strong on that topic. But we'll continue to push for that. I mean the federal government is such the key employer, of course, in the metro, I mean implicitly in our guidance is not much of a change in the current reality on the ground getting all those folks back in the office would be helpful.  And I remind you there is a difference between the type of employee. If you're in the National Security world, you've likely been at the office the whole time and as that group grows, there need to be closer in and closer into their office will continue to be relatively high. Again I'm hopeful that we get - there's been some action in Congress by the way, some bills introduced to get federal workers back in the office.  So, I'm hopeful that that's a positive, but it isn't an income, it's not inside of our guidance that we expect improvement. It's just a hope we have both frankly as taxpayers and as owners of real estate in DC. \nJamie Feldman: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then, I guess a similar question across the markets in Seattle where you know, so far this cycle we've seen major differences depending on where in the market assets are located or even diverse today. What are your thoughts there? And what do you think the implications are? Transit matters much or how should we be thinking about your outlook there? \nMark Parrell : I mean, for us, right now, it's really like Belltown CBD is where you see the pressure, where you see the prices that are still materially off from where they were in March of 2020. The suburbs there feel good right? It's not like great and robust, but they are healthy. So it's really just a suburban versus urban kind of differential that we see across that Seattle market. And when you think about the supply that's coming, it will impact not only urban but also the suburban areas, as well for next year in that market. \nJamie Feldman: Okay. Alright. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. \nHaendel St. Juste : Hey there. Good morning. Why don't you go back to the West Coast markets for a bit? I was curious, if you could give us a bit more color on what you are seeing in terms of concessions maybe between San Fran, Seattle, and parts of LA? And then, at a high level, what are your blended rate growth expectations for the West Coast versus East Coast markets in the back half of the year? Thanks. \nMichael Manelis: Hey, Haendel, this is Michael. So let me just \u2013 I\u2019ll start with just the overall kind of concession used in the portfolio. Fairly consistent in the second quarter versus kind of the first quarter. Overall, we're running about 15% of the applications are receiving just about a month. About 80% of all the concessions that are being used are concentrated in the urban centers of both Seattle and San Francisco.  In downtown San Francisco, it's about 50% of the applications are receiving about six weeks and in downtown Seattle, it's about a third of the applications that are receiving just over a month. In terms of the spreads in the West Coast markets for new lease change, I don't know if I have that kind of handy.  I will tell you that right now the East Coast markets have been outperforming the West Coast by about 400 basis points. My guess is that spread is going to stay fairly consistent although you definitely have some movement in LA with some of the changes happening with bad debt. \nHaendel St. Juste : That's helpful. Thank you. And where's the loss to lease in the portfolio today? And where is it highest and where is it lowest? \nRobert Garechana : Sure. So right now, the loss to lease at 3.7% which, for this time of the year is actually a little bit stronger than what we have seen historically. And maybe rather than like going by market around loss to lease, I could just kind of cluster them for you and group a few by a range. So like New York and San Diego, have the highest loss to lease right now, which has been running about 9%.  And then that's followed by like DC, Orange County, Boston are all very tightly clustered in this like 4.5% to 6% range. And then, you go to like the Denvers, the San Francisco, Seattles and LA, those are all in like the flat to 2%. And then I have my expansion markets of Dallas and Austin are the two markets right now they're in a gain to lease.  I think when you put all of this into the blender knowing where pricing trend is today, like I said, with that 6% growth from the beginning of the year, sitting with the 3 7 loss to lease which is above kind of a normal year. It really does put us in a great position not only to finish out the year, but to have a starting point for \u201824, that's really above a norm. \nHaendel St. Juste : Got it. Very helpful color. Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning and happy 30th anniversary. So two questions on both actually around acquisitions. So, Mark, Sam used to talk about trading sardines and eating sardines. As you guys look at your experience in the - in the - especially in the urban markets, the bigger assets, do you see those assets in EQR going forward? Do you see them more as trading sardines or eating ones? \nMark Parrell : Interesting. I love that analogy out for a historical reference point. I mean, these - some of the markets like New York, if you want a presence in Midtown, the assets by definition are mostly large and costly, all right?  So, it's more of a market than a type decision, I would say, I think it's more likely that you'd see us sell a large asset, because we just want to lower our market exposure there, not because we're particularly allergic to a large asset in the market if it's not performed well or if we have an over concentration in a submarket, you'll see us sell it.  So, I guess, I don't know what to do with that analogy in a sense that larger assets are harder to sell. We generally operate in pretty efficiently. We generally can run capital pretty efficiently to make up for that. But I don't have a sardine type description for you. Except to say that I think we\u2019d sell if we don't like the spot, big or small asset. \nAlexander Goldfarb : Wait, I guess what I'm saying, what I'm getting at is given the volatility that we've seen in the urban markets, do you think that it's better for EQR going forward to be more nimble. And say, look, we have a base of assets that we like more in the suburbs where it's harder to get in, harder to get out in the cities where, you'll go up to a peak, where you have record rents.  And it's easier to sell and then sort of trade around. That's what I'm trying to get at. If the urban markets are more like trading markets versus long-term markets, so you're always trying to sort of arbitrage exposure. \nMark Parrell : Yeah, I guess, I don't, I don't agree with that. I'd start off by saying, volatility in all sorts of assets and you're about to see volatility in the Sunbelt markets with these kind of prices. The fact that they're smaller assets just means that the price has just declined. I mean, the way to protect against volatility in the markets that to be in a position with your balance sheet and your strategy, we are not a compelled seller.  So, for us, volatility can mean opportunity, right? If prices go down enough, as I mentioned in my remarks, in even in San Francisco, we'd be a buyer. So, I just want to make that clear. For us about volatility is opportunity, not always a negative. And the way we protect ourselves is by having a broader platform. So I think one of the lessons we learned over the last 10-15 years is a broader platform means you can act more quickly and more markets and take advantage of those volatile moments where, Austin, Texas trades cheap to long-term value and you are a buyer there or New York trades cheap and you're a buyer there.  So, I think as you see us balance the platform out, you're going to see us be more - even more opportunistic. And I wouldn't shy away from buying a large asset. I think you just got to go with your eyes wide open about those assets being harder to sell. And there is something you\u2019d add Alec? \nAlexander Brackenridge : Yeah. Alex, this is Alec. And I would just add that take Manhattan or actually Boston and DC relate any of our urban markets to reproduce those portfolios would be virtually impossible. I mean, Manhattan, I don't know how you'd find \u201825, really well located assets in any amount of time. So we've got an unusual opportunity that we're taking advantage of today and you're seeing in Manhattan it\u2019s the best performing market in the country. And you just couldn't decide all of a sudden you wanted to reproduce that. \nAlexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then, the second question is, given it's a competitive market for transactions we saw one of your peers duo two large transactions that are basically neutral initially. Are there ways for you guys to enhance your initial yield be it like, buying in the in the further the mass positions or junior positions? Or are there other ways that you can enhance your yields.  So that when you do close on a deal, it's more accretive than often it seems like, in REIT lands, a transaction ends up being neutral year one and it's not until year two or three that we start to see the benefits. \nMark Parrell : Yeah, I'm going to split this up a little bit for the team to answer. I think I want to start by Alec talk about cap rate certainly matters a ton. But we also think a lot about replacement cost and I'm going to ask Michael or Bob to just talk about platform scaling, margin expansion at EQR, those kinds of things Alex that can affect year two yields. So, why don\u2019t Alec? \nAlexander Brackenridge: Yeah, so this is Alec. What we're really focusing is a very targeted buyer right now and what we're targeting our opportunities whereas Mark says, there's a discount to replacement cost but also a limited supply pipeline. So that typically has been out in the suburbs. And those kinds of base - if you get in at a good basis like that, that's the best thing for your investment in the long run rather than some kind of mezz fees - that might be a little bit of financial engineering, getting it to a good basis it's just be irreplaceable. \nMark Parrell : Yeah, and I think from the operator\u2019s standpoint, I think we have worked really hard over the last couple of years to build a platform that is highly scalable. So, when we go into these markets, we're looking really at the ability to kind of leverage staff across properties, put them onto our platform, kind of put them into our pricing system and it's clearly accretive from an operating margin for us when we're looking at underwriting these deals. Right now, when we look across these markets, any of the acquisitions we're looking at, we're saying even in our existing markets, what benefits do we get by bringing this into that portfolio? Whether that\u2019s at a submarket level or the market as a whole. \nMichael Manelis : Yeah, and I just think, you've asked some, some great questions, Alex. I mean, we're in a really good position where we've got teams in the markets. We can underwrite quickly. We can take over management quickly. But we're not over exposed to the supply. And there's going to be a lot that's going to be sold in the Sunbelt markets.  And I think you should think not just about us selling some of these legacy urban assets and affecting I'll call it the numerator, but that's making the company net bigger, likely by using some of our debt capacity that Bob and his team have created so capably over the last few years to go out there and be a net buyer.  And I think what's more important the management team and the Board is that, per pound replacement cost discount. I think we're looking for the deals to make sense on an initial cap rate basis, as well. But I mean, the most important thing, most important signal to us historically has been buying at a meaningful discount to replication cost and in an environment where construction costs are high and they may be flat for a year or so, but they're likely not going to decline in our opinion much.  You can get a discount to basis. You got a little moat around your asset. I like everything about that. So I think that's what you'll hear us talk about if we're fortunate to see some assets out there to buy in these expansion markets and in the suburbs of our existing markets. \nAlexander Goldfarb : Thank you. \nMichael Manelis : Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. \nMichael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on bad debt. Can you provide some context in terms of what's included or implied that happens to bad debt in the back half of the year in your updated guidance? Thanks. \nRobert Garechana : Yeah. So, good question, Michael. It's Bob. So in the back half of the year, we will actually finally switch to bad debt helping with the growth rate by about 30 basis points and the reason is because, we continue to see that sequential improvement of bad debt and we will cross over the difficult comparable period, that relates to the rental relief payments at in the prior year. That accretion or that benefit to total revenue growth is likely not going to occur until the fourth quarter, because in the third quarter of 2022, you still had elevated rental relief, but we think we will cross over there. We think at the, by the end of the year, when you look at the full year basis, we will end the year around, call, it 125, 130 basis points as a percentage of total revenue and bad debt, which is still elevated relative to the historical norm of 50 basis points and leaves opportunity for more contribution to growth as you go into 2024. \nMichael Goldsmith : Got it. Thanks for that. And my second question is more of a strategic question. Arguably, you have one of, if not the best position portfolios for the market right now, given the strength in coastal urban areas. And then we consistently are being told that, you're looking to have a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban coastal and Sunbelt.  So, could you just talked a little bit about - like, how should investors reconcile kind of the strength of the portfolio, now to kind of the overall strategy of diversifying away from what's working right now? Thank you. \nMark Parrell : Yeah. Great. Great question. Very fair. I think you're going to see the baton kind of pass. I think for a few years, these Sunbelt markets are going to be pretty stressed. And I think a lot of the owners of these assets aren't long-term owners. They\u2019re developers with impatient capital, expensive development debt and we can buy those properties again for a good basis as we just discussed. And add them to the portfolio.  I think our kind of resident is increasingly in some of these Sunbelt markets. But yet the Coastal markets, have real supply advantages that you're seeing right now. So creating a real balanced portfolio for our investors, I think for the next year or so, they're going to benefit from just better coastal dynamics on the supply and demand side.  I think after a while those things will even out, and I think they have a portfolio that year-in and year-out outperforms, not just in certain periods, but year in and year out. It just requires more balance between urban and suburban and coastal and Sunbelt. And we're really balancing the demand and supply, risks, and opportunities.  We\u2019re thinking a lot about regulatory risk. And we're thinking a bunch about resilience. The cost for example of insurance in Florida. The cost of casualty and repairs and things like that are getting more significant. So, I think as we talk to our investors and I think this has been well received and the instruction we\u2019ve received from the Board is to again, try and create this portfolio that's a little more balanced as to opportunities and risks.  And I think what our investors will get are hopefully league-leading numbers for the next, I don't know how many quarters, 18 months to 24 months. And then, hopefully, at some point we'll start to see supply abate and these other new markets and we'll be there to take advantage of that having purchased at an attractive basis. So, in my hopes and dreams, that's how it would play out. \nMichael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half. \nMark Parrell : Thank you. \nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. \nAdam Kramer: Yes. I think you've done a really good job of kind of presenting pricing trends on a kind of a seasonal or sequential basis historically. Thinking about 5.24 in your most recent deck for example. Just wondering, thinking about kind of the, the late summer months and into the fall, maybe just walk us through your assumptions for kind of growth relative to the normal seasonal pattern? \nMichael Manelis : Hey Adam, this is Michael. So, I think what we've said is, we expected this year to follow normal seasonal rent, both on a rent seasonality, demand seasonality. And right now and we said it was going to be a little bit muted.  We didn't expect rents to peak quite as high as what they would normally peak. Right now, we're doing kind of right where we thought we would be, turning the corner, heading into August, we would expect just given the application volume and the foot traffic we're seeing that we've got several weeks left of what I would say is the peak leasing season where we'll continue to inch up a little bit of rate.  And then, as you turn the corner and you walk your way in through September, we do expect that rates will start to moderate a little bit. We have so many years of data. We're looking at all of these stats and we haven't really seen anything that tells us not to expense - not to expect that normal kind of softening that occurs in the late third quarter, and into the fourth quarter, both from the pricing trend standpoint, little bit on the occupancy standpoint, but right now, we feel pretty good because of the Southern California situation that occupancy will continue to improve and be stable for us for the year.  So I just think you just got to look through all of those stats and just put yourself into a bell curve and allow both rent seasonality and demand seasonality to kind of tail off in the third late third quarter and fourth quarter. That's what we're modeling. We've seen years clearly, where we've been able to defy that and hold the line with rate or have good demand kind of going all the way through the fourth quarter. I just don't have any insight right now to say that this is going to be the year that does that. \nAdam Kramer: That's super helpful. Really appreciate that color. And then, I guess, just frankly a kind of a similar question, but thinking about back earlier in the year, I think you guys put out a kind of 2.5% market rent growth forecast for the full year. Wondering if it you know if this point in the year kind of knowing what you know you have the half year results in so far. Would you make any kind of changes to that number? Or is that kind of still how you are thinking about for the full year on average 2.5% market rent growth? \nMichael Manelis : So, Adam, this is Michael again. No, I think we're like, we're running right at it, like we're right on top of these numbers. I think that market rate growth, you layer on top of where our embedded growth was in the beginning of the year, our ability to capture the loss to lease. And then you had that intra period growth.  You put all of that stuff into the blender together and it was pointing us to this like 4% blended rate growth for the year? And right now, that's like exactly where we're headed. So, I wouldn't change that number outlook at all. \nAdam Kramer: Thanks so much for the time. \nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mark Parrell. Please go ahead. \nMark Parrell: Thanks, Roots. Thank you all for your time and interest in Equity Residential today. Enjoy the rest of your summer and we look forward to seeing many of you out on the Fall Conference Circuit. Thank you. \nEnd of Q&A: Everyone else had left the call. This does concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the second quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets. We continued to produce very solid results with same-store revenue growth of 5.5% in the second quarter that are in line with our improved May guidance expectations.  Results are driven by a continuing improvement in delinquency, along with a continued healthy fundamentals in the business. As with last quarter, East Coast markets continue to outperform West Coast. Our results to-date reflect our view that we have previously shared with you that pricing trends will follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory.  Generally, layoff announcement seem to have dissipated and our average resident remains in great financial shape with rent-to-income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. Resident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent often early indicators of resident economic stress remained below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations.  The overall employment picture continues to be healthy and young adults are choosing the attractive lifestyles available in our markets. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive proposition. In fact, less than 8% of our residents gave bought home as the reason for their move out in the second quarter, which is well below the 12% norm for this period.  Combined this with the overall favorable competitive new supply position, we face in most of our markets and we are on track for a good year in 2023. As a reminder, a combination of more difficult, same-store revenue comparison periods, including the absence of governmental rental relief this year and a reversion to a more normal rent growth pattern will result in more moderate, but still above historical growth in the second half of 2023.  As we sit here today in the back half of our primary leasing season, the portfolio is 96% occupied with good demand and resident retention. We expect a continued healthy trajectory for the remainder of the leasing season. Our portfolio-wide occupancy is being depressed by turnover in Southern California, primarily LA, as we work our way through the delinquency issues.  In the longer run replacing, these vacant units with paying residents outweighs the slightly lower short-term occupancy.  Now, let me spend a few minutes talking about market performance. So let's start with the East Coast. New York was by far the top performer for the second quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of more than 13%. We have very little competitive new supply in the market and our occupancy sits near 97%.  Demand indicators continue to be positive, making this market the expected top performer for the year Boston, produced slightly above 8%, same-store revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by strong demand across the sub-markets with our urban properties outperforming our suburban ones. We continue to hear stories of tough commute times for suburbanites that are resulting in residents coming back to the city.  While new Supply in the market is above the five-year average, the large majority of it is not competitive with our assets and appears to be readily absorbed. Heading down to DC, this market continues to impress with same-store revenue growth of 6.3% in the second quarter, despite a high level of new supply across a number of sub-markets.  The market just keeps going, absorbing these units at a healthy pace and delivering some of the best revenue growth in the portfolio. As an example, Reverb, our new 312 unit development in Central DC, which is currently in lease up is delivering weekly application volumes well above expectations allowing us to reduce concessions and push rate.  Occupancy in the DC market is just below 97% and we are optimistic for continued strong performance for the year, but recognize the increased volume of new supply that will be delivered in the rest of this year.  Now for the West Coast. Our Southern California markets achieved some of the strongest sequential revenue growth in the quarter demonstrating the early financial benefits of backfilling long-term delinquent units with paying residents. Unlike the Orange County and San Diego markets, which posted good quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, Los Angeles produced slightly negative quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.  This reported number however, is not indicative of the health of the market, but more noise from bad debt due to large rental relief receipts in the second quarter of 2022. When you strip this noise out, same-store quarter-over-quarter revenue growth would have been over 5% positive for LA. We are still seeing healthy demand in Los Angeles and have not felt any negative impact from the worker strikes in the entertainment industry.  Our direct exposure is not significant, but acknowledge it may soften overall market conditions in the coming months which could slow our ability to relieve some of our vacant units. In addition to the strike, we continue to see more non-paying residents move out, which is resulting in at least 100 basis point drag to occupancy in the market.  We view both of these issues as isolated short-term impacts to the market, as the strikes will end, and delinquency will gradually resolve itself, which coupled with the long-term demand we see as catalysts for next year above average market growth in LA.  Moving to San Francisco, a market reported respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth at 3.1%, which would have been 4.6% after adjusting for the impact of rental relief received in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, the San Francisco market demonstrated leasing velocity in line with normal seasonal trends, and met our expectations for the second quarter.  The South Bay, which represents 37% of our NOI in the market continues to be a bright spot. Prospects are telling our local teams that the area meets their hybrid work requirements by keeping them close for in office days and providing better lifestyle options and more space and access to the natural outdoor amenities.  Our recent resident survey tells us that 77% of our residents in the San Francisco Bay area are either hybrid or fully in office. In downtown San Francisco, we hear from our teams that new residents say that they are leasing to get closer to work. The good news is that the quality of life in downtown San Francisco continues to improve and the local government's focus seems to be showing some signs of promise.  While our pricing power in the sub-market remains less than desired and concessions are still being used. Downtown has been stable and allowed us to capture demand and regain occupancy to 96% in that sub-market. The overall sentiment in the San Francisco market indicates that the tech layoffs are mostly behind us, and there's a lot of momentum around AI, which keeps us optimistic on the continued recovery in this market.  Heading to Seattle, while there is vibrancy in the market with improvements in the quality of life issues, some return to office activity and tourism back to pre-pandemic level, the market continues to underperform our expectations. While net effective pricing in the overall market is now 2% below the March 2020 levels, there is a wide dispersion among sub-markets with the downtown Seattle well below the March 2020 levels, primarily due to the continued concession used in this sub-market.  Overall, Seattle has been a market that has struggled to deliver consistent strong demand over the last couple of years, as its tech-heavy workforce has had the flexibility to work from anywhere. But this market to fully recover, it needs to see more consistent, strong job growth with better quality of life conditions that will bring people back to the market.  The good news is that we are starting to see some positive signs in South Lake Union, which is a tech-heavy neighborhood in the City of Seattle, and this is likely due the Amazon return to office, which began in May. We are hopeful that this activity will soon spill over to the other downtown submarkets.  Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up about 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has been mostly in line with our acquisition performance and guidance expectations. Our portfolios in Denver, Dallas and Austin continued to be the most impacted by new supply like we discussed last quarter.  Meanwhile, Atlanta remains a bright spot with double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. In a minute, I will turn it over to Bob to discuss our operating expense performance and the balance sheet. But let me take a minute to discuss our operating platform, which is humming as we continue to reap the benefits of our focus on innovation and the technology evolution at Equity.  We are focused on the customer experience and the feedback we receive from our customers help us in developing our platform to drive superior financial performance and customer satisfaction. The insights we gained from our resident survey, which garnered more than 32,000 responses validates our strategy of combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution, while delivering self-service solutions to our customers.  Leveraging data and analytics on top of our resident feedback will create further opportunities to expand our operating margin. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment, and rapidly scale what works across this portfolio.  I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results.  With that, I will turn the call over to Bob. Hey, Eric, this is Michael. So, I think right now, of course we're watching to see is anybody turning keys in breaking leases at a pace that's kind of above, which you would expect to see. And we really just haven't seen any impact from the strikes and our onsite folks are telling us just the overall direct exposure to it. It doesn't seem to be significant.  I think my comments in the prepared remarks were, you know right now we clearly are running occupancy about 100 basis points below normal for this time of year in that LA market. So the ability to lease up some of these units that have been vacant which, were from the delinquent - long-term delinquent residents moving out earlier in the year than what we thought.  We just think that if the strike is prolonged and keeps going on, it could just create a little bit of a pause in people's willingness to make decisions to move - to move into a new place. And that could impact just the overall demand profile in the market. But today, really not seeing anything and I'm not overly concerned about it. But it is something we just got to be aware of it. Yeah. Hey Steve. This is Michael. So, for the renewal right now, you're right. We've got our quotes are out there for the next three months or so. It's been fairly consistent is what we've seen in the last couple of months. And right now based on conversations, we've been seeing through our centralized renewal team. We don't really expect to see a lot of variation.  We think we're going to continue to renew about 55% to 60% of our residents and achieve right around, a 5% to 5.5% kind of achieved renewal rate growth, which incorporates a little bit more negotiation and typically what you see is as you get into the beginning of the peak leasing season, our centralized renewal teams we tightened up that negotiation range, thought to like 100 150 basis points on our quote.  Now what we expect to see is, we get in towards the tail end of the peak leasing season. Just to kind of drop that off a little bit and probably negotiate about 200 basis points off of the quotes that are out there. But again, I think we remain really optimistic about the performance centralizing this team has really given us the ability to kind of pivot quickly and really deliver consistent results.  In terms of the new lease pressure right now, I think if you would just look at some of the reported stats and you can see kind of in Seattle and San Francisco where you're still doing that concessions in those urban centers, that's definitely weighing in on some of our ability to have a new lease change kind of go positive.  But again, I think overall, where we sit today in this leasing season, it's playing out kind of exactly like we thought where rents are sitting, where our new lease changes and the renewal performance and we just see kind of the markets reacting like they normally will through kind of the season. And that's kind of what's baked into the guidance that we have. Yeah. Hey Josh. This is Michael. So maybe I'll just hit on overall kind of some of the initiatives in the innovations and I'll let Bob kind of touch base on the actual margins. So, I think what we put out in our May investor presentation really just kind of highlighted the initiatives that we have keyed up. And this year specific to 2023, we have about $10 million included in the NOI guidance with about two-thirds of that being on the expense front as we keep working through kind of the innovations of leveraging resources across assets.  And right now, we're really focused on kind of teeing up the next round of initiatives and it's really more income-based and probably other income-based items that will really kick into gear in the back half of this year and start delivering kind of results into 2024.  Right now, we are literally right on track with our numbers and we feel really confident and about the incremental $10 million for '23. And maybe Bob, if you just want to hit on the overall margin impact to that. Yeah, so Josh, this is Michael again. So right now, in Seattle, we're kind of actually in a low of going up against kind of head-to-head competitive supply. If you look at what's expected to be delivered and completed in \u201824, I think we're going to see that Seattle number kind of hinge up on us. And, it is something we're absolutely kind of watching and kind of making sure that those units will be delivered.  And when we create our guidance for \u201824, it's something that we will fold into that market. For us right now, Seattle, it's just been - it's kind of gets momentum and then it stalls a little bit. And then it gets momentum. So we really just haven't felt that consistent kind of strong job growth that's really needed to get us back on track and really get us out of that concessionary environment.  But to-date, it's not really the new supply that's been impacting us. Yeah. Hey John, this is Michael. So, I mean, I'm going to touch on a few different things here. Let me - I'm going to start with kind of the rent first and then I'll address the new lease change relative to July. And I'll tell you just we went back and we looked at like the last 15 years of our data and our pricing trend which is that net effective price for our units.  It typically peaks out somewhere in that late August to - or late July to mid-August period. And really the first week of August is kind of that most common time frame. I tell you, we've had really strong foot traffic, strong application volume. So, I'm not going to be surprised that if we don't see a few more weeks of slight increases in rates, kind of coming through our system.  And that being said, I mean, right now this pricing trend is up about 6% since the beginning of the year and it's right where we thought it was going to be. So even if we just peaked out at this level right now, it's kind of right in line and we will be just buying in terms of its flowing through the other stats. In terms of that deceleration of new lease change, I'd start by saying I would not read too much into any single month as this stat it's really better to look at over time.  And I think that what you saw in our release, it was like a ten basis point different. That's just a lot of noise for maybe who moved out and versus who moved in and where that was being done. And right now, I'll say that the new lease changes being more impacted by that concession used in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco.  But again, I think as we turn the corner and we looking at August I wouldn't be surprised if those not inch back up a little bit. We're really in this tight band relative to our expectations about new lease renewals and how that kind of translates into that blended new lease or the blended rate. So, I wouldn't read too much into any one month stat. Well, it's Mark, and Michael may add to this. I mean, through the real estate roundtable, there's been a lot of advocacy around that of trying to get federal workers back on the job. I'm hopeful that it continues to push the administration put something out. It wasn't very strong on that topic. But we'll continue to push for that. I mean the federal government is such the key employer, of course, in the metro, I mean implicitly in our guidance is not much of a change in the current reality on the ground getting all those folks back in the office would be helpful.  And I remind you there is a difference between the type of employee. If you're in the National Security world, you've likely been at the office the whole time and as that group grows, there need to be closer in and closer into their office will continue to be relatively high. Again I'm hopeful that we get - there's been some action in Congress by the way, some bills introduced to get federal workers back in the office.  So, I'm hopeful that that's a positive, but it isn't an income, it's not inside of our guidance that we expect improvement. It's just a hope we have both frankly as taxpayers and as owners of real estate in DC. Hey, Haendel, this is Michael. So let me just \u2013 I'll start with just the overall kind of concession used in the portfolio. Fairly consistent in the second quarter versus kind of the first quarter. Overall, we're running about 15% of the applications are receiving just about a month. About 80% of all the concessions that are being used are concentrated in the urban centers of both Seattle and San Francisco.  In downtown San Francisco, it's about 50% of the applications are receiving about six weeks and in downtown Seattle, it's about a third of the applications that are receiving just over a month. In terms of the spreads in the West Coast markets for new lease change, I don't know if I have that kind of handy.  I will tell you that right now the East Coast markets have been outperforming the West Coast by about 400 basis points. My guess is that spread is going to stay fairly consistent although you definitely have some movement in LA with some of the changes happening with bad debt. Yeah, and I just think, you've asked some, some great questions, Alex. I mean, we're in a really good position where we've got teams in the markets. We can underwrite quickly. We can take over management quickly. But we're not over exposed to the supply. And there's going to be a lot that's going to be sold in the Sunbelt markets.  And I think you should think not just about us selling some of these legacy urban assets and affecting I'll call it the numerator, but that's making the company net bigger, likely by using some of our debt capacity that Bob and his team have created so capably over the last few years to go out there and be a net buyer.  And I think what's more important the management team and the Board is that, per pound replacement cost discount. I think we're looking for the deals to make sense on an initial cap rate basis, as well. But I mean, the most important thing, most important signal to us historically has been buying at a meaningful discount to replication cost and in an environment where construction costs are high and they may be flat for a year or so, but they're likely not going to decline in our opinion much.  You can get a discount to basis. You got a little moat around your asset. I like everything about that. So I think that's what you'll hear us talk about if we're fortunate to see some assets out there to buy in these expansion markets and in the suburbs of our existing markets. Thank you. Hey Adam, this is Michael. So, I think what we've said is, we expected this year to follow normal seasonal rent, both on a rent seasonality, demand seasonality. And right now and we said it was going to be a little bit muted.  We didn't expect rents to peak quite as high as what they would normally peak. Right now, we're doing kind of right where we thought we would be, turning the corner, heading into August, we would expect just given the application volume and the foot traffic we're seeing that we've got several weeks left of what I would say is the peak leasing season where we'll continue to inch up a little bit of rate.  And then, as you turn the corner and you walk your way in through September, we do expect that rates will start to moderate a little bit. We have so many years of data. We're looking at all of these stats and we haven't really seen anything that tells us not to expense - not to expect that normal kind of softening that occurs in the late third quarter, and into the fourth quarter, both from the pricing trend standpoint, little bit on the occupancy standpoint, but right now, we feel pretty good because of the Southern California situation that occupancy will continue to improve and be stable for us for the year.  So I just think you just got to look through all of those stats and just put yourself into a bell curve and allow both rent seasonality and demand seasonality to kind of tail off in the third late third quarter and fourth quarter. That's what we're modeling. We've seen years clearly, where we've been able to defy that and hold the line with rate or have good demand kind of going all the way through the fourth quarter. I just don't have any insight right now to say that this is going to be the year that does that. So, Adam, this is Michael again. No, I think we're like, we're running right at it, like we're right on top of these numbers. I think that market rate growth, you layer on top of where our embedded growth was in the beginning of the year, our ability to capture the loss to lease. And then you had that intra period growth.  You put all of that stuff into the blender together and it was pointing us to this like 4% blended rate growth for the year? And right now, that's like exactly where we're headed. So, I wouldn't change that number outlook at all."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2023 results. As we work our way through the leasing season, the business is performing well with same-store expenses now looking a little bit better than we thought leading us to lower our guidance for that item last night.  As a result of this, and lower expected interest expense, we are pleased to again raise our same-store net operating income and normalize funds from operations guidance after raising same-store NOI and NFFO guidance just two months ago based on better expected revenue results.  In a moment, Michael Manelis will give you color on revenue drivers across our markets. After Michael's remarks, Bob will address the details of the improvement in our expense, and NFFO guidance, as well as our successful pending refinancing activity.  The overall theme here is that Equity Residential continues to benefit like most of the multifamily industry from solid demand, but with the more unique benefit of our mostly coastal portfolio being less exposed to the significant levels of supply just beginning to be delivered in the Sunbelt markets. We also continue to manage expenses well in an inflationary environment, which we expect will allow us to drive more dollars to the bottom-line than our competitors over time.  In terms of specifics, in the quarter, we continued to post strong same-store revenue results driven by good demand across our markets and rapidly improving delinquency in Southern California. As you may recall, we increased the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance for the year at 5.875% in May, right before the NAREIT conference to reflect these factors.  That in turn caused an improvement of 100 basis points in our same-store NOI guidance midpoint and a $0.03 per share improvement in NFFO guidance at the midpoint. These continued strong operating results speak to the durable nature of our business in a phase of some pretty volatile economic conditions. Despite the layoff headlines, particularly in the tech sector that dominated the news in late 2022 and early 2023, we see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic.  Also in places like Seattle, we are hopeful that the return to office mandates by employers like Amazon will drive incremental demand back into the urban areas of the city as commute times become intolerable for workers who dispersed far outside the city in response to COVID and are now required to be in the office frequently and as quality of life issues in these urban areas improve.  And while new supply is certainly pressuring the Sunbelt and Denver markets as I mentioned before, we are seeing moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets. Even in Washington DC, where we are seeing the highest levels of competitive new supply is being absorbed at a good rate and the market is performing well.  Switching over to the transactions market, that market continues to be relatively quiet. We do not sell anything in a second quarter. We did buy a couple of deals including a newly developed property in lease up in Atlanta that I spoke about on our first quarter call. The other acquisition in the second quarter is a 287 unit property located in suburban Denver, which we purchased for approximately $108 million at an acquisition cap rate of 5%.  The transaction market generally remains stuck between buyers who expect lower prices, given the huge shift in interest rates and the less accommodative capital markets and sellers who remain wedded to early 2022 values and by and large have assets that are still operating pretty well. So they feel no great compulsion to sell right now.  Our sense, is that sales will pick up over the next 6 to 12 months and sellers accept the reality of rates being higher for longer as floating rate loans with expiring caps reset and as developer capital invested in newly completed development deals becomes impatient.  Now a quick note on our capital allocation strategy. As we've discussed with you for the past few years, we continue to have a goal of having a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban and between Coastal and Sunbelt markets. We think such a portfolio will create the highest returns and lowest volatility over time. The recent issues caused by COVID in urban centers and the current issues in the Sunbelt markets due to supply, our examples of the opportunities and risks we wish to balance.  As opportunities present themselves in the Sunbelt and Denver markets and in select suburban, locations of our coastal markets to acquire or develop great assets at fair prices, we will be there to do so.  And before I turn it over to Michael, I want to take a moment to celebrate our 30 years as a public company. On August, 12th 1993 Equity Residential went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Much has happened in the past 30 years, We grew From about 21,000 units, and an initial valuation of $800 million in 1993 to more than 225,000 units across more than 50 markets at the peak leading to our 80,000 units and a value of more than $26 billion today.  On this journey, we acquired a number of other public apartment REITs, as well as some very large private portfolios including Archstone. At the head of this enterprise for all those years was our amazing Founder and Chairman, Sam Zell who we lost in May. Sam's guidance and influence are part of our DNA at Equity Residential and we will continue to run this company to honor his legacy of delivering superior long-term value to our shareholders.  We thank all of you for your support over the past 30 years and for your kind words regarding Sam's passing.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. And John, it's Mark. Just to add to that, I mean, when you think about what supports apartment values there is certainly a lot of unallocated private capital. We've heard numbers up to $800 billion of private capital looking worldwide for real estate exposure. So, I think people, Chief investment officers, those kind of funds, just need to see some stability before they're willing to move.  I'm hopeful that towards the end of this year and early next, we'll be talking to you about some better numbers in those markets operationally. And I think that will also encourage capital flows. But I agree with Alex. I think it'd be really hard to peg a cap rate. It's almost like on a per unit per square foot basis, kind of conversation at the moment, but I think that's going to shift given the amount of capital on the sidelines and given our hope that operating results will improve over the next 12 months. Well, what'd you run into is what ends up being a really compelling discount to replacement cost. So, I think people will start looking in that and realize that getting in at a good basis in one of these good - these good cities, it's just really compelling. So I just really think that'll be a floor and will prevent too much of a gap from arising. Great question. And what we've sort of thought about is we see ourselves as sort of 60% or so urban right now. And I get that number below 50 will probably be a goal. I think expanding into the Sunbelt markets, as you know, is a goal. And I think a great opportunity with the amount of product that's coming through. And I think in the suburban markets is some of our current coastal areas is a good idea too.  So my guess, John, is you'll see, sort of one-third of the portfolio in Denver and these Sunbelt markets five years from now. And you'll sort of see more of a 50-50 split urban, suburban. But we are a creature of opportunity.  And, if there was an opportunity to be to stay more urban because it was just absolutely compelling prices as Alec described, John, we'd certainly think hard about that. I mean, we're not - we feel like having a more balanced platform will give us better cash flow growth - more stable cash flow growth over time.  But you know the name of the game is buying right and if we can buy very well, we might move tactically for a while a different direction. Thank you. Hey, Steve, it's Mark, and Alec may join in a second. I mean, we've got a, it's good to have a solid internal team, which we have and good JV relationships with toll and others and we see all this stuff. But as Alec has said on prior calls, it's just not penciling out. There's not enough of a risk premium in what is a risky endeavor of development.  So, for us, I think acquisitions seemed like a better place to invest capital for the time being. I think what could change there is just some sense that, are the rents have moved a lot. I doubt costs are going to move down in any material regard, but I think right now, I like the development pipeline being smaller. In terms of the yields we're looking at, it's mid to high fives on our existing portfolio.  The Laguna Clara deal in California, which is a one mile away from Apple headquarters deal was a little lower than that. It's an existing asset we're densifying. So there's less risk since we know the area so well. But beyond that, Steve, they're kind of high-five type of situations and to do a development deal, we need something to get into that close to that six range. And I don't - we may start a deal this year. We may not start anything we'll see. Thanks Steve. Yeah. So what's amazing about DC and even when you drill in by submarket, you really don't see a huge differential in our performance. And I think part of that is just when we talked about new supply coming into that market. They got such a great transit environment there that supply really in any one of these sub markets can pull from other areas. So we really haven't seen any deviation of the performance across the submarkets.  Now, when you look forward to the balance of the year, like it was back half loaded for deliveries. So we are aware that we're going to be facing more and more competitive supply. And it is fairly dispersed across some of these submarkets. But again I don't think we're forecasting to have like more pressure in one submarket than the other, because of that transit environment that could pull from everywhere.  The outlook for the balance of the year, it's still good, right? We're producing really strong revenue growth. Good absorption of the supply. It may soften up a little bit, but I think we still have this momentum coming in and I think it's positioned well for \u201824, even though you got another round of supply coming at you again. It's a market that's been demonstrating resilience and stability. I mean, for us, right now, it's really like Belltown CBD is where you see the pressure, where you see the prices that are still materially off from where they were in March of 2020. The suburbs there feel good right? It's not like great and robust, but they are healthy. So it's really just a suburban versus urban kind of differential that we see across that Seattle market. And when you think about the supply that's coming, it will impact not only urban but also the suburban areas, as well for next year in that market. Interesting. I love that analogy out for a historical reference point. I mean, these - some of the markets like New York, if you want a presence in Midtown, the assets by definition are mostly large and costly, all right?  So, it's more of a market than a type decision, I would say, I think it's more likely that you'd see us sell a large asset, because we just want to lower our market exposure there, not because we're particularly allergic to a large asset in the market if it's not performed well or if we have an over concentration in a submarket, you'll see us sell it.  So, I guess, I don't know what to do with that analogy in a sense that larger assets are harder to sell. We generally operate in pretty efficiently. We generally can run capital pretty efficiently to make up for that. But I don't have a sardine type description for you. Except to say that I think we'd sell if we don't like the spot, big or small asset. Yeah, I guess, I don't, I don't agree with that. I'd start off by saying, volatility in all sorts of assets and you're about to see volatility in the Sunbelt markets with these kind of prices. The fact that they're smaller assets just means that the price has just declined. I mean, the way to protect against volatility in the markets that to be in a position with your balance sheet and your strategy, we are not a compelled seller.  So, for us, volatility can mean opportunity, right? If prices go down enough, as I mentioned in my remarks, in even in San Francisco, we'd be a buyer. So, I just want to make that clear. For us about volatility is opportunity, not always a negative. And the way we protect ourselves is by having a broader platform. So I think one of the lessons we learned over the last 10-15 years is a broader platform means you can act more quickly and more markets and take advantage of those volatile moments where, Austin, Texas trades cheap to long-term value and you are a buyer there or New York trades cheap and you're a buyer there.  So, I think as you see us balance the platform out, you're going to see us be more - even more opportunistic. And I wouldn't shy away from buying a large asset. I think you just got to go with your eyes wide open about those assets being harder to sell. And there is something you'd add Alec? Yeah, I'm going to split this up a little bit for the team to answer. I think I want to start by Alec talk about cap rate certainly matters a ton. But we also think a lot about replacement cost and I'm going to ask Michael or Bob to just talk about platform scaling, margin expansion at EQR, those kinds of things Alex that can affect year two yields. So, why don't Alec? Yeah, and I think from the operator's standpoint, I think we have worked really hard over the last couple of years to build a platform that is highly scalable. So, when we go into these markets, we're looking really at the ability to kind of leverage staff across properties, put them onto our platform, kind of put them into our pricing system and it's clearly accretive from an operating margin for us when we're looking at underwriting these deals. Right now, when we look across these markets, any of the acquisitions we're looking at, we're saying even in our existing markets, what benefits do we get by bringing this into that portfolio? Whether that's at a submarket level or the market as a whole. Yeah. Great. Great question. Very fair. I think you're going to see the baton kind of pass. I think for a few years, these Sunbelt markets are going to be pretty stressed. And I think a lot of the owners of these assets aren't long-term owners. They're developers with impatient capital, expensive development debt and we can buy those properties again for a good basis as we just discussed. And add them to the portfolio.  I think our kind of resident is increasingly in some of these Sunbelt markets. But yet the Coastal markets, have real supply advantages that you're seeing right now. So creating a real balanced portfolio for our investors, I think for the next year or so, they're going to benefit from just better coastal dynamics on the supply and demand side.  I think after a while those things will even out, and I think they have a portfolio that year-in and year-out outperforms, not just in certain periods, but year in and year out. It just requires more balance between urban and suburban and coastal and Sunbelt. And we're really balancing the demand and supply, risks, and opportunities.  We're thinking a lot about regulatory risk. And we're thinking a bunch about resilience. The cost for example of insurance in Florida. The cost of casualty and repairs and things like that are getting more significant. So, I think as we talk to our investors and I think this has been well received and the instruction we've received from the Board is to again, try and create this portfolio that's a little more balanced as to opportunities and risks.  And I think what our investors will get are hopefully league-leading numbers for the next, I don't know how many quarters, 18 months to 24 months. And then, hopefully, at some point we'll start to see supply abate and these other new markets and we'll be there to take advantage of that having purchased at an attractive basis. So, in my hopes and dreams, that's how it would play out. Thank you. Thanks, Roots. Thank you all for your time and interest in Equity Residential today. Enjoy the rest of your summer and we look forward to seeing many of you out on the Fall Conference Circuit. Thank you."

            "name": "Robert Garechana",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Let me start with expenses before covering our financing activities. We reported same-store expense growth of 5.5% in the quarter. The main drivers of this growth were repairs and maintenance and on-site payroll. Repairs and maintenance growth in the quarter was driven by continued wage pressure, particularly from contracted services.  Payroll growth was mostly due to elevated employee benefit cost during the quarter relative to the same period last year. Without these costs, reported payroll growth would have been 2.6%, which was more in line with our expectations and reflective of the efficiencies we have been achieving from our various operating initiatives.  For the full year, same-store expense guidance we have lowered the midpoint of our range by 25 basis, points to 4.25%. This reduction is driven by expectations of continued low real estate tax growth due to modest rate increases and successful appeals activity, as well as significantly lower expectations for commodity prices, which are muting utilities expense growth.  These more favorable trends will be partially offset by slightly higher payroll and other onsite expenses stemming from the elevated employee benefit cost mentioned from Q2 and administrative costs from the expiration of the eviction moratoriums respectively. The revised guidance implies that significantly lower rate of growth for expenses during the second half of the year relative to our results through Q2.  We think that this is challenging, but definitely achievable given the easier comparable period from the back half of 2022 and the visibility we have into the items I just described.  Finally, turning to the capital markets and our 2023 refinancing activities. As we previously discussed, the company has an $800 million secured debt pool that matures in the middle of the fourth quarter. The debt originated from the Archstone transaction back in 2013, currently carries a rate of 4.21% percent and a portion of it needs to be refinanced in the secured market for tax reasons.  During Q2, we began marketing this opportunity to lenders and I'm happy to report we've received significant interest from a variety of capital providers. In July, we selected lenders and entered into two loan commitments and locked in slightly below 5.25% rate for the $530 million that we're refinancing. This was approximately 135 basis points over the 10-year treasury at the time and was lower than what we would have expected to do had we been issuing an unsecured bond.  As you may recall, we've previously also entered into interest rate swaps to hedge this financing and those were settled for an over $25 million gain. When the gain is amortized over the life of the loan, it results in an economic cost for these financings of 4.7%, which we believe is an excellent outcome, given the environment.  Once these loans close, we would expect the company to end the year with approximately 8% floating rate debt, over $2 billion in immediately available liquidity and no real debt maturities outside of commercial paper until June of 2025. This, coupled with the lowest leverage in the company's history position us very well should any opportunities arise.  With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for question and answers. Hey Eric, it's Bob. So, looking at kind of our NFFO for Q3 and Q4, there's nothing really in particular that's a standout on a one-time item. It's really the cumulative growth in NOI that you're seeing in Q3 and then pushing that into Q4 coming from same-store. Drilling down a little bit into that, I would say the only thing from a sequential standpoint that is maybe a little bit abnormal is the bad debt component.  So we're seeing bad debt improve in the fourth quarter and in the third quarter sequentially as we get back to a normalization. So, beyond that there isn't really anything sequentially strange about the - or one-time in nature about the growth for runrate.  As it relates to '24, I think it's a little early to talk about kind of \u201824, kind of where we are in terms of positioning. But what I would tell you is our numbers are kind of following that typical seasonal pattern that we've seen and same-store is really driving the operational results. Yeah. So, from a margin standpoint that will all be a accretive to margin. I guess, I would say that in the states we talk we all talk about very different margins. So I'm going to talk about the margin I guess, that I think is most important which is the cash flow margin, which we highlighted at the NAREIT Conference. So, cash flow margin meaning after CapEx after expense at all of that. We're already running at a league-leading level as it relates to that cash flow margin.  And when you layer in the initiative, that Michael is talking about and that's inclusive of what you have to spend in order to achieve that that ROI and CapEx, etcetera, we think we can get a few percentage points of incremental increase there and that's what we're striving for. Yeah, I just want to make a comment on Seattle. It's obviously for most of us pretty far away. So people aren't out there quite as much, but there's been an amazing renaissance in the city in terms of access to the waterfront. Very similar to the Big Dig in Boston. I think that's a very positive catalyst for quality of life in the downtown area where we have a lot of assets.  I do think there's an election coming up. There's been improvement in attitude in city government about livability and those issues. That's a positive. But I think Michael is, right. I think you're going to see a lot of supply, which on the one hand, Seattle is a market where actually the percent of rent to income is lowest with New York for us.  So there's an ability to pay more rent and there's a lot of high paying jobs and a lot of good industry in the Seattle metro area and has the city gets we hope more livable as people take advantage of these new Waterfront amenities. And I think, we feel good about Seattle and its ability to draw people in again, in scale and Amazon's just kind of called people back to the office.  So our folks on the ground say there is some momentum there in South Lake Union or Amazon has a lot of office workers. So we'll see where that takes this as well. But you asked a very narrow question. I'm giving you more. But I do have a sense of optimism about Seattle, but we have to navigate some of that supply the next really in \u201824 and \u201825 more than in \u201823. Yeah, so let me break down - hey John. It's Bob. Let me break down a couple pieces. When you're comparing the 472, what I'm guessing you're comparing to where our unsecured are trading today. What you're incorporating in that is the impact of the hedges, right? So in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that we - when we issue the secure, we haven't issued it.  But when we lock rate on the secured loan, we are at a 135 basis points on the treasury at that time, which was, call it 5.25. How you get the 470 as you apply the gain that we got, because we give some forward, starting swaps at really attractive rates and that reduced it to 470. So what we should compare is really the spread that 135 basis points that I talked about in my prepared remarks to where the spread that would be implied in our unsecured.  And that's a lot more narrow. That's probably five to ten basis points hit or miss between either one. So they're relatively on top of each other. We think maybe we're, maybe five basis points inside on secured. But that's, one day's worth of trading activity could flip you and you be a parody. Sure. So right now, the loss to lease at 3.7% which, for this time of the year is actually a little bit stronger than what we have seen historically. And maybe rather than like going by market around loss to lease, I could just kind of cluster them for you and group a few by a range. So like New York and San Diego, have the highest loss to lease right now, which has been running about 9%.  And then that's followed by like DC, Orange County, Boston are all very tightly clustered in this like 4.5% to 6% range. And then, you go to like the Denvers, the San Francisco, Seattles and LA, those are all in like the flat to 2%. And then I have my expansion markets of Dallas and Austin are the two markets right now they're in a gain to lease.  I think when you put all of this into the blender knowing where pricing trend is today, like I said, with that 6% growth from the beginning of the year, sitting with the 3 7 loss to lease which is above kind of a normal year. It really does put us in a great position not only to finish out the year, but to have a starting point for \u201824, that's really above a norm. Yeah. So, good question, Michael. It's Bob. So in the back half of the year, we will actually finally switch to bad debt helping with the growth rate by about 30 basis points and the reason is because, we continue to see that sequential improvement of bad debt and we will cross over the difficult comparable period, that relates to the rental relief payments at in the prior year. That accretion or that benefit to total revenue growth is likely not going to occur until the fourth quarter, because in the third quarter of 2022, you still had elevated rental relief, but we think we will cross over there. We think at the, by the end of the year, when you look at the full year basis, we will end the year around, call, it 125, 130 basis points as a percentage of total revenue and bad debt, which is still elevated relative to the historical norm of 50 basis points and leaves opportunity for more contribution to growth as you go into 2024."

            "name": "Alexander Brackenridge",
            "content": "Hi, yeah, John. This is Alex. Yeah, there would not be a robust bid today. Larger properties are harder to sell. There's some contrary in money out there. But I don't know if it's willing to make a big bet. So I really don't have an exact number because I just haven't seen a trade. I think most people if they didn't have to trade, just wouldn't be willing to accept the number. So, it's almost theoretical at this point.  I think over time, that'll change as the markets continue to improve and access to capital becomes more normal. It's just such an abnormally hard time to raise sizable capital that I really think it would be a tough time. It was a distressed sale via pretty high cap rate and maybe not indicative of what the more or less distressed owner would be willing to sell at. Yeah. Alex, this is Alec. And I would just add that take Manhattan or actually Boston and DC relate any of our urban markets to reproduce those portfolios would be virtually impossible. I mean, Manhattan, I don't know how you'd find \u201825, really well located assets in any amount of time. So we've got an unusual opportunity that we're taking advantage of today and you're seeing in Manhattan it's the best performing market in the country. And you just couldn't decide all of a sudden you wanted to reproduce that. Yeah, so this is Alec. What we're really focusing is a very targeted buyer right now and what we're targeting our opportunities whereas Mark says, there's a discount to replacement cost but also a limited supply pipeline. So that typically has been out in the suburbs. And those kinds of base - if you get in at a good basis like that, that's the best thing for your investment in the long run rather than some kind of mezz fees - that might be a little bit of financial engineering, getting it to a good basis it's just be irreplaceable."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Martin McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.\nMartin McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2023 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer and Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer are here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.  Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2023 results. We had a very good quarter to start the year with same-store revenue results exceeding our expectations. And while same-store expense growth was higher than we projected due in large part to California storms, that still left us with first quarter net operating income and normalized FFO better than we expected. In a moment, Mike will take you through our first quarter operating highlights. The strength of our revenue results point to the durable nature of our business in the face of volatile economic conditions.  We continue to see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic and moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets, with the new news in the quarter being the rapidly improving regulatory conditions in California. Based on these continuing positive business conditions and the good prospects we see for our business going forward, during the first quarter, our board raised our common share dividend by 6% on an annualized basis. Despite headlines and layoffs, demand feels solid.  The unemployment rate, particularly for the college educated, remains very low, which gives us a good feeling about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. In our portfolio, we are not seeing increases in residents downsizing their units or giving us their keys because of job loss. In terms of competition from homeownership, monthly costs and down payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making renting a high-quality equity residential apartment a better value. Only 8% of our residents who moved out in the first quarter bought a home, and that's down from 12% in the first quarter of 2022. On the apartment supply side, as we have discussed with you on previous calls, we expect 2023 national apartment new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the level of direct competition that supply will pose to us, given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties. In our coastal markets where we still have 95% of our NOI, we see very manageable competitive new supply in most markets, with Washington, D.C. being the exception, though D.C. is holding up remarkably well so far.  In the Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing. And in Denver, we are seeing higher relative supply and more impact. We anticipated this when we acquired our Sunbelt in Denver properties, and these properties are generally tracking consistently with our underwriting.  As we look to expand our portfolio in these markets, we expect that these new deliveries will present buying opportunities for us. Mike will also discuss first quarter same-store expense growth, which was higher than we expected, especially in the repairs and maintenance and other on-site operating expenses lines.  We think this growth was inflated for discrete reasons that will pass, and we continue to be comfortable in attaining our full year same-store expense range in part due to lower than previously anticipated real estate tax growth, combined with modest on-site payroll expense growth. We have created at our company a culture and system that uses technology and centralization to improve the customer and employee experience and to contain our payroll costs.  While the transaction markets remain unsettled, we did do a couple of deals to start the year. We sold a small collection of 25-year-old properties that totaled 247 units in Los Angeles for about $135 million in advance of the transfer tax increase. Also after the end of the quarter, we purchased a newly developed property in Atlanta for about $79 million that is currently in lease-up. The property is located directly on a portion of the Atlanta beltline that is being improved and paved. The beltline is a desirable amenity to our demographic and has been a catalyst for economic growth and densification across the area. The property's economics benefit from various tax credits and when fully stabilized next year, we expect to attain a 6.6% acquisition cap rate. Removing the tax benefits, which will burn off over time, we see the stabilized fully taxed acquisition cap rate at 5.7%. We also love our basis in this property, which is at $288,000 per unit, and we see that as a 15% to 20% discount to current replacement costs. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us to answer your questions on the transaction market. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to review key takeaways from our first quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets, along with same-store operating expenses. As Mark mentioned, we produced very good same-store revenue growth of 9.2% in the first quarter. These results were ahead of our expectations, primarily due to continuing improvement in delinquency along with continued healthy fundamentals in the business. Before I get into more details on these topics, I want to emphasize that as we sit here today, the early stages of the leasing season and its setup remains strong. With year-to-date pricing trend improvement just above 3.25%, which is where we would expect it to be at this point in the year and is also consistent with expectations underpinning guidance. During the quarter, we continued to see good demand and strong resident retention that produced low turnover, stable occupancy and solid pricing power.  Despite some recent negative job headlines, our average resident remains in great financial shape. With rent income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. The Resident lease breaks due to job loss and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic threats remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. A resilient labor market, along with a large number of young adults choosing the exciting attractive lifestyles our markets provide, along with the convenience and cost benefits of renting continues to result in application volumes that are on par with the same period last year and continue to grow as expected into the leasing season. Couple this with the favorable supply position and lack of single-family home ownership competition that Mark outlined, and we should be positioned for another good year. Results to date support the view we shared on our February earnings call that we expect pricing trends for this year to follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory. Given the difficult comparison periods for 2022 for the back half of the year, along with the return to normal rent growth patterns, we expect that the first quarter will be our highest reported same-store revenue growth with more moderate but still above historical growth in subsequent quarters. While there may be some uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, as I said previously, we are not seeing this impact our day-to-day operations. While we acknowledge that we are generally a lagging indicator, so far so good as we head to our primary leasing season. Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our market performance. Let's start with the East Coast. New York and D.C. are both exceeding expectations, while Boston is in line. New York was by far the top performer for the first quarter with same-store revenue growth of over 19%. With very limited and isolated supply, the outperformance in this market is consistent across all submarkets. Occupancy is currently 97.5% and all demand indicators continue to flash green, making this market the expected top performer for the year. Turning to D.C. Performance has thus far been a pleasant surprise with the market continuing to absorb significant new supply, while still delivering good revenue growth. Similar to New York, occupancy is strong, and so far, all submarkets remain resilient in the face of new supply. Now for the West Coast, Southern California continues to post good numbers. And most notably, we are starting to see improvement in delinquency, particularly in Los Angeles, which has the heaviest concentration. As the eviction moratorium expired, we are seeing more of our delinquent residents figuring out the best option that works for them, which is either paying rent or moving out. This activity started to pick up pace late in the first quarter, which was sooner than we expected and has continued into April. While these move-outs are pressuring physical occupancy, it will benefit our financial results later in the year as we have good demand in the market to replace these residents with new residents that will pay their rent. Our remaining 2 West Coast markets of San Francisco and Seattle have posted respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth with good demand, but pricing power remains less than desired, especially in the urban centers of both of these markets. The San Francisco market is performing in line with our expectations, which already assumed a slow recovery. Use of concessions, mostly in the downtown submarket remains common along with limited pricing power. Meanwhile, the South Bay submarket is demonstrating signs of improving pricing power and stronger occupancy with less widespread concession use based on a combination of factors that includes a greater variety of stable employers who are committed to the area, coupled with just a better overall quality of life. Heading to Seattle, the overall market continues to demonstrate a lack of recovery, which wasn't completely unexpected, but is behind our forecast. Similar to Downtown San Francisco, Downtown Seattle lacks pricing power with concessions being used on over 70% of our applications. The East side, which we felt may hold up a little bit better, is still outperforming downtown, but is a little more challenging than we thought based on supply pressure, layoffs and overall just less hiring in the submarket. Amazon's May 1 mandatory return to the office date has a potential to be a catalyst for this market. Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up a little less than 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has mostly been in line with our acquisition performance and guidance expectations. As we expected, we are being impacted by heavy new supply in Austin, Dallas and Denver. Meanwhile, Atlanta remained strong with double-digit revenue growth for the quarter. Now moving to expenses. We reported same-store expense growth of 7.2% in the quarter, which was slightly above our expectations. We had always expected Q1 growth to be higher than our full year guidance range, mostly because the growth during the first quarter of 2022 was so low, but also from pressure on a few specific items that outpaced positives in a few other expense categories. On the favorable side, we continue to benefit from good performance in real estate taxes and payroll, along with utilities, which were still elevated but lower than expected. On the unfavorable side, incremental cost in repairs and maintenance, other on-site costs and higher-than-anticipated insurance costs drove higher-than-expected first quarter same-store expense growth. For most of these costs, we had anticipated an increase but not quite to this degree. Elevated repairs and maintenance was in large part due to increased outsourcing in the quarter much of which stemmed from our own internal teams in California, focusing on the after effects of the severe rainstorms, which resulted in incremental outside vendor assistance.  Higher legal and administrative costs related to faster progress in response to the expiration of the eviction moratorium, the benefit of which can be seen in our bad debt net. Insurance expense was higher due to tougher conditions than the already challenging environment we assumed on the renewal of our property insurance policy, which was completed during the first quarter. Despite this pressure, we remain comfortable with our existing guidance range on the full year same-store expense growth. At this point, we expect slower full year growth in real estate tax and utilities than we initially expected to offset the overages experienced in other categories in the first quarter. Lastly, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation and the technology evolution of our platform. In 2023, we have a positive NOI impact of just over $10 million included in our guidance with about 2/3 of that coming on the expense side primarily in payroll and repair and maintenance. This benefit will mostly be realized in second half of the year which will contribute to lower expense growth for that period. On the revenue side we will continue to focus on other income items like WiFi, parking and pricing optimization. We will also leverage data analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margins. Our vision is to augment pricing and renewal strategies by combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution while delivering self-service solutions to our customers. We will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create opportunities to share on-site employees across multiple properties. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment and rapidly scale what works across the portfolio. This uniquely positions our company to continue to create additional revenue streams while managing expenses to maintain and grow margins even in an inflationary climate. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is going to come from Eric Wolfe from Citi.\nEric Wolfe: Just looking at your same-store revenue guidance, it looks like you're expecting roughly 4% growth for the rest of the year, maybe a bit higher if you're accounting to be better trends in bad debt. But just curious whether it's sort of the majority of the drop-off happens in 2Q and then sort of stabilizes? Or if the drop-off is a little bit more ratable through the year?\nRobert Garechana: Eric, it's Bob. I would say that the drop-off is more ratable through the year because what's going on in the 2023 kind of guidance is really more about what's happened in 2022, than the kind of core trajectory of the business. So we continue to expect kind of that sequential leasing component, but you start getting into -- starting in Q2 and really into Q3. Difficult comp periods from 2022. And so you'll see Q1 as the high point and then a pretty consistent but above trend quarter-over-quarter rate of growth as you go through the back end of the year.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. And then I think you said you expect the peak leasing season to play out as it normally would. But I also thought I heard you say that rent growth might be a bit more muted for its history. So just trying to tie those 2 statements together? I'm just trying to understand if market rents are sort of growing as they normally would during the peak leasing season.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Eric, this is Michael. So I think there's 2 factors. One, the way that the rents are moving, and I said, albeit a little bit muted, that's more indicative to when we think about normal rent patterns of pricing trends. We came into the year with our guidance expecting the sequential build. We just didn't think we were going to see kind of outsized momentum anywhere near the pace that we saw last year. And in terms of the setup right now, I guess I would just say the portfolio is sitting at 96.1% today. We've got great momentum. The blended rate for April sitting right at 4%, you get the sequential build and pricing trend at 3.25%, which basically positions us right where we thought we would be heading into this peak leasing season.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Just to supplement that, Eric, it's Mark. It's the difference between guidance when we gave our guidance, we talked about the year being kind of like a normal year 2023, but maybe a little bit less of intra-period growth and what's going on so far this year. And so far this year, absolutely consistent with that expectation. So it's -- those 2 terms are being used to describe different things, guidance versus so far so good this year.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from John Pawlowski from Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Bob, the first question is on real estate taxes. I know this year is faring well. Just be curious, as you stare out the next few years, are you seeing any early examples or hearing any chatter that cities need to tax apartments a little bit harder to fill the hole left by office and other commercial real estate sectors that are seeing impaired valuations?\nRobert Garechana: Yes, I would say that not a lot of chatter yet because we're really just focused on 2023. And to your point, John, 2023 is actually better than what we anticipated.  Obviously, we have that Anchor with prop 13 in California, which is helpful. As you move beyond, you always deal with that issue of revenue gaps and budgetary gaps and where people are going to get money out of what pocket. So far, we feel good about where we are, very good about where we are in 2023. And it's too early to tell -- but with these municipalities, what they'll do in 2024, what those revenue gaps will look like and where -- what pockets they'll come to get it. So, so far, I'd say too early to tell for '24.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then last one for me. Michael, just curious if you could expand on the softness in pricing power you're seeing in Denver and your expansion markets. I know it's a small sample size of properties, but just curious how you're seeing fundamentals on the ground there relative to some softer West Coast markets.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I mean I think I would carve them out a little bit different. So Denver, you clearly have supply pressure sitting on top of us in the downtown submarket, but yet the suburban portfolios are actually doing pretty well. When we go into the Texas markets, we clearly are seeing just more concessions being used. You have demand, right? But when you look at across all of these expansion markets, any of the reported data, including our own portfolio, which again is a pretty small subset. It's less than 5% of the company's NOI. The occupancies tend to be running lower in these kind of expansion markets for us. The one exception I would say for us is Atlanta, seems to be doing a little bit better than even what we thought coming into the year. We just don't have quite as much supply pressure on us. So we see a little bit better pricing power than what we thought.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Would you expect Denver and Texas NOI growth to lag or outpace your legacy footprint over the next year or 2?\nMichael Manelis: Oh, I mean I think clearly, our coastal markets right now are set up not even for this year, but just the entire setup, the demand drivers that we see, the cost of housing in those markets has really positioned them to outperform. But again, as we went into these sunbelt, we knew like what to expect for these first couple of years. So for us, the positive is that -- the large majority of our acquisitions are trending slightly ahead of how we perform in them and clearly in line with our expectations for this year.\nOperator: Next question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.\nStephen Sakwa: Just a couple of follow-ups on the topline growth. Michael, I know you don't necessarily guide to leasing spreads, new renewals or blend. But just any thoughts on kind of where our spreads might be for the year? And it certainly sounded like bad debt is trending better. I realize it might be a little too early, but how much of a tailwind could that be if things continue sort of on the path they're on today?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Well, maybe I'll start, and Bob, you can kind of build a little bit on the bad debt. So in terms of just the leasing spreads and kind of guide, a lot of that had to do with where we were with our embedded growth, where we were with loss to lease, capturing the loss to lease. And I think I said, right, as we were working through the call back in February, we expected roughly 2%, 2.25% on new lease change for the full year, renewals right around 5% and blended is right around 4% for the full year. When you look at where we sit today, we're set up going into our peak leasing season, where, again, we're going to do 60% of the transaction. We're set up right where we thought we would be relative to the guidance. We have a little bit of pressure that we're doing more concessions in those downtown submarkets in Seattle and San Francisco. But that's kind of being offset by some of the outperformance we're seeing in the East Coast markets.\nRobert Garechana: Yes. And Steve, on the bad debt side, just to fill out the question, we are -- we certainly did better in the first quarter. We expected the first quarter to sequentially be equivalent, excluding governmental rental assistance to the fourth quarter, and we're a couple of million dollars better. And that equates to a little bit under 10 basis points on a full year basis for revenue. That trajectory is continuing into April, so it's still early. And so we would expect to perform better overall. But keep in mind, the 90 basis points assume that we're having improvement. So it's just how much that improvement is better relative to what we embedded in guidance, but we do think there's potential upside there. To the extent we continue to see that same pace as we play out through April into May and the rest of the year.\nMark Parrell: And Steve, it's Mark. Just to help you with your mod a little. The governmental payments are really key to the volatility because in the first quarter of '22, we got about $9.5 million of governmental rental relief. In the second quarter, we got almost $15 million in 2022. So we need to make up that difference in terms of improved delinquency performance in the second quarter. And then you drop all the way down to a little below $6 million in the third quarter and then only $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. So you can see that those rental relief payments are key to understanding. So the delinquency, we think, will improve the whole year, but there could be quarters where bad debt net because it's being compared to a number with so much governmental rental relief in it is just not as good as it appears to be, and then the next quarter, you'll see it even back out.\nStephen Sakwa: Okay. And then just, I guess, second question is on sort of capital deployment. I mean, you guys did raise acquisitions and dispositions to still be net zero. But I'm just curious what -- and maybe distress you're sort of seeing in the marketplace and what opportunities that might afford you thinking back to the coming out of GFC, you guys were early to buy broken condos and did the transaction. I'm just curious if you're starting to see things percolate and -- and I guess secondly, are you seeing a big slowdown in new starts or planned starts from maybe some of the competitors and merchant builders?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Steve, this is Alex. Well, first of all, transaction volume is down pretty dramatically. So the closings will be down about 60-plus percent across the country. And that's pretty evenly spread among the different markets. So a lot less activity, but the sellers that do act now understand that cap rates are somewhere between 5% and 5.25%. So they're eager to transact. And that comes from really 3 different types of sellers. There's the private REITs that have the redemption request that they have to fulfill.  So we're seeing some activity from them. The merchant builders aren't really capitalized to own property in the long run. They always expect it to be able to execute and get out of the deal. So a little bit of that. And gives some floating rate borrowers who have caps that are expiring that they are not able to cover. So there are sources of opportunity, but it's really been slow so far. But I would expect all 3 of those areas are more likely to pick up than not in the next 6 months.  So we are excited to deploy more capital as those opportunities arise. And as you mentioned in the past, we've taken advantage of dislocation in the market. So we're certainly set up to that. But in the meantime, we're trading in and out of properties, so selling -- dispose opportunistically and taking advantage of acquisitions that we see. In terms of starts, I mean, they're dramatically down. Already this year, what we were thinking in our markets would be, say, 110,000 starts is now looking like it might be half of that today, and I expect even more things that we thought might start will drop off the list through the rest of the year. It's really hard to make a development work in an environment where cap rates are, as I said, 5% to 5.25%, you need a yield at least around a 6%. And you just can't get there with costs that may not be rising as high as quickly as they used to a year or so ago, but they're still going up, and obviously, financing costs are higher. So it's just really hard to make a development underwrite. So we expect to see more and more deals drop out, development deals.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And Steve, it's Mark. Just to supplement that. I mean all this supply in the Sunbelt markets, Denver, places we'd like more long-term exposure, but we recognize that it's going to be a tough couple of years, that's an opportunity for us. I mean we're going to sell low performing assets in the coastal markets are assets where we have an over concentration in the sub market and kind of trade in and accepting that there might be a little near-term decline and putting it in the pro forma. But as you said, I mean, I'm very hopeful. I think we're in a really good spot where our numbers are going to show well comparatively in the costal markets, we'll exercise our usual good expense control, and then we'll turn around and deploy capital. And Alex got a big team, a very capable, experienced people out there ready to buy. So I think we'll be active as soon as those opportunities are more substantial.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: This is Chandni Luthra, Goldman. Could you guys help us understand what the collections process will look like from here? And what the magnitude and timing of recovery from past accounts could shape up to be. Like do you have to go to courts to get rents from tenants who are perhaps no longer active with you or you're just evicting now? And what kind of experience are folks witnessing with the court processes these days?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Chandni, it's Michael. So we clearly have evictions filed right now with the courts. You are seeing a little bit of momentum pick up. I would tell you across the country right now, it feels like most of this stuff is set up at about a 6-month timeframe from the time you file to the time you actually get to your proceeding with a court date.  But really what's happening on the collections front is twofold. So one, you have individuals that you are filing on that have a lot of past balances with you. But if they start paying you current month's rent, those past balances are somewhat protected still to date and go out into like '24. I think maybe some of them even stretch into '25. So you have a little bit of a longer tail to go after the previous balances to collect. But we are starting to see this resident behavior where they're making decisions either to move out in front of any kind of eviction proceeding or actually just start paying us their current month's rent knowing that we're ultimately going to have to come to terms with what happens with this previous balance. In areas where those balances are not protected, we have sent much of that over to the collection agencies and let collection agencies start working.  That's a slow process because typically, what you need to see is a lifestyle change. You need to see somebody needing to go buy a car or a home or some other thing that then causes them to come to terms that they got to clean up that balance. So I think what you should expect to see is the court system is going to continue to move at this pace of, call it, the 6-month window. And you'll see us gradually just start chipping away at this delinquency and gradually start to improve the recovery of this -- of the past balance.\nChandni Luthra: So then can there be a reversal to some write-offs or some reserves that you've taken in the past as we sort of think about the magnitude going forward?\nRobert Garechana: Yes, certainly. To the extent that all of those historical balances that Michael just described have been written off. So to the extent that you collect them, you would see that as a current period pickup offsetting bad debt. So those collections would flow through. But as Michael mentioned, we would expect that. We don't -- haven't really incorporated much of that overall that we'd expect that to really trail.\nChandni Luthra: Got it. Very helpful. And a follow-up question is on L.A. mansion tax. So obviously, you guys sold a property ahead of that sort of tax change on April 1. But as we think about the composition of your current portfolio and what you've laid out in the past that you want basically 33% of your portfolio. It's sitting in sort of each of the coasts and then 33 in the Sunbelt. How do you think about the impact from this policy change to affect how you think about sort of selling properties in L.A. going forward and you're reaching towards that optimal mix of geography that you've laid out in the past?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Well, clearly, it has an impact. It's a big move in the rate from 1.5% to 5.5% in L.A. And it was designed to raise cap the [indiscernible] money for cities to build affordable housing. I think it probably had the reverse effect and that there won't be that many transactions, so they're not going to collect very much. So it may be that this gets reduced over time. So we don't know that it will be around forever because it doesn't seem to be well thought out public policy. But in the meantime, there are other ways -- other properties that aren't subject to the tax within California that we can transact on. And we can also consider joint ventures as an opportunity to lower exposure in a market like L.A., where selling a property may not make a lot of sense.\nMark Parrell: Yes. Chandni, it's Mark. And just to supplement Alex answer. We -- I mean, it certainly impacts the tactical way to get to the success to lower that exposure. But mean we remain committed to the goal, and we're just going to figure out different ways to do it. And again, maybe you're selling properties in Ventura County instead or in -- outside the city of San Francisco and the County of Los Angeles, and we have plenty of those, too. So we've got other levers to pull, and we'll be thoughtful about that.\nOperator: Next question goes to Michael Goldsmith from UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: On the concessions, have they gotten better or worse as the year has progressed? And is the gap between markets? Is it getting lighter or narrower?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So Michael, this is Michael. So concessions for us right now are really concentrated in those urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. I think what you saw when we turned the corner into January, and we were getting on that first -- or the fourth quarter call, I was telling you that the demand was picking up, and you saw the concessions starting to slow down across most of the markets that absolutely held true almost all of the markets now have weaned themselves off of the concessions, except what we saw in somewhere around that middle of February and into March, you really saw the concession use pick up in those downtown urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco, and they've been fairly constant. I'll tell you the last couple of weeks, we see a little bit of hope right now that the demand is picking up. Application volume is picking up in those areas, and you could start to see us get to a place where we could start pulling them back again. But for the most part, just in the rearview mirror, they've been constant for the last couple of months for us.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's very helpful. And then my second question is on the transaction market. Does this 5.7% stabilized cap rate on the Atlanta deal, does that represent a motivated seller or a function of the actual market? Is this where deals are going forward? And maybe just on a broader terms, like -- are you starting to see a reopening of the transaction market now that you're guiding to a modest amount of activity in the year?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Michael, this is Alex. The 5.7% really isn't a reflection of market. It's more a reflection of the property being in lease-up right now. So we're taking it over the middle of a lease-up and we're going to finish it off. So we're getting compensated for doing that. So I would say, as I said earlier on the call, the rates are somewhere between 5% and 5.25% for a typical deal. And so yes, we're getting a little bit of a boost there because we're taking on a little bit of a lease-up, but that's not an indication of market. And then in terms of other opportunities, I mean, we're obviously always looking for other opportunities, and it has been pretty slow though so far.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.\nNicholas Yulico: So I want to go back to the topic of job losses. And I know you said that you're really not seeing that much of an impact. But are there any indications yet of job losses of residents impacting expected turnover? I mean, is there anything you're learning now as you're sending renewal notices out for the spring? And I guess if there's any differentiation you're seeing on this topic between tech heavier markets like San Francisco, Bay Area, Seattle, where there has been more high-profile job losses announced versus other markets of yours.\nMark Parrell: Yes, Nick, it's Mark. I'm going to start, and Michael is going to supplement with some market specifics. I mean, again, when we look at the general economics, professional and business services, for example, still has positive job growth. And that's an area where we do have a lot of our residents employed.  Finance and insurance kind of flat, information service is certainly down but not down that dramatically, and the unemployment rate remains very low, especially for the college educated. So I guess, I just want to point out again on the macro. The macro picture is very good for our company and for the markets we sit in, not just in the long term, but in the near term in the here and now. So certainly, there can be another shoe that drops, but the current numbers we're all seeing are certainly declined from the COVID recovery numbers, but they're still pretty good, and people losing jobs are finding them. And that's been the experience that looks to me like in the general economy. And I'll let Michael comment on what he's seeing in the rest of our portfolio.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. And I think, one, you got to put into context that the reported turnover for the first quarter was really low. I mean it's not quite record little, but it's really low number. So the absolute number of move-outs that we're having is clearly below any kind of historical norms. And when we start drilling in and we look at those reasons for move-out, we're really not seeing anything indicative of changes. You're not seeing kind of job loss or job change pick up anything different than what you would expect for the first quarter of any given year. Specific into like a Seattle or San Francisco where you saw kind of more of the headlines and we said on the last call, we thought a lot of those layoffs were being dispersed across the country, not just heavily concentrated in those markets. I think what you've seen, we have not seen anybody really give us keys telling us they're breaking the lease or they're not renewing because they were laid off.  What we do notice in those 2 markets is the in-migration, meaning what percent of brand new residents are coming to us from outside of that MSA. The in-migration in those 2 areas is less than what you otherwise would have expected, which I think makes sense given not only the layoffs, but more importantly, like the hiring freezes that have been taking place. So you're just not seeing them draw into the market like they used to.\nNicholas Yulico: That's very helpful. My second question is going back to Los Angeles. And it's a market that doesn't look like it has much supply, except for Downtown. And you did talk about delinquent -- dealing with delinquent units going forward, right? In some cases, it's impacting occupancy right now or at some point, it will. And I guess what I'm wondering is how you think -- how you feel comfortable with this. It's almost like a shadow supply type of scenario where you and other landlords are finally getting tenants out in L.A. and that you feel confident that there's enough demand to fill tenants leaving?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Again, it's Mark, Nick to start, and Michael may have something to add here. But I'll start by talking about the employment base of our residents as we see it in the market. So we looked at sort of the big tech majors, and we said what percent of our residents have stated that they're employed by those big companies in Los Angeles, and that's something on the order of 3%. So I think we just have very low exposure to those sort of tech folks in the very diversified L.A. economy. So I think L.A. just, frankly, is stronger than San Francisco Bay Area and stronger than Seattle right now where we have higher numbers of our residents employed by those sorts of people and probably bigger local economic impacts. So I think we're, in your opinion -- it's almost like we have 2 empty buildings in Los Angeles, we're delivering into same-store over the rest of this year and that we're going to fill up, and we've got the demand for it. So I think when you look at the local economy, that matches up very well with our portfolio. They're in content creation. They're in other businesses, some of which feel some pressure. But this disproportionate tech layoff, that isn't a Los Angeles phenomenon that's occurring to all over the country. In the extent there's any concentration, it's more San Francisco and Seattle than it is L.A.\nNicholas Yulico: Yes, No, I wasn't specifically really wondering about tech in L.A. I just meant the issue of delinquent units coming back to market for you and other landlords, right, as you're getting people out and rates almost a supply issue in the market.\nMark Parrell: Yes, but the supply is being met by people that have jobs. That was the point of my comment. It isn't -- a lot of these people are in diversified industries. So it isn't like everyone is losing their job down in Los Angeles. There's -- it's very well employed down there. A lot of people looking for housing, a lot of demand, Michael sees good demand numbers in terms of applications and the like. So that's the source of our confidence, a diversified economy in which -- like I said, us and others are effectively delivering empty buildings into that, but I'm confident that demand will need it given what we see on the ground and given the composition of employment in the market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC is next.\nRichard Anderson: So back to the bad debt question. If you were to sort of magically flip a switch and you'd be back to 40 basis points bad debt like you'd see normally, would that recovery be less than the rent relief number that you -- gathered last year about $32 million. I'm wondering how much the rent relief overcompensated you or maybe under compensate you for the bad debt that you took on? I'm just trying to understand that math.\nRobert Garechana: Yes. So -- the government -- you're right, the governmental rental relief in '22 was $32 million. You would have to get back to, call it, 40, 50 basis points normal, that's $1 million a month of bad debt. If you look at kind of the disclosure for Q1, we were averaging like probably around -- certainly in January and February, more like . So it's like a $3 million spread -- so you'd have to get $3 million times the 12 months or so is about where you'd be at, which would be a little bit more than what the governmental rental relief would be. But you're getting there if you got back to, call it, that $1 million a month right away. That's obviously not what's happening yet. We're hopeful that, that happens and the sooner the better from a growth perspective. Does that help, Rich?\nRichard Anderson: Yes, yes. That's great. And then my second question is, Michael, I think you mentioned you're running a 3.25% market rent growth at this point. If memory serves, I think you said your guidance presumed 3% market rent growth for 2023. And I know you guys are trying to be careful about overpromising having not updated guidance yet, and that's coming later. But it seems to me you're ahead of the schedule from a market rent growth, particularly at this point in the year, shouldn't 3.25% barring a major disruption from some sort of recession. Shouldn't that really be a maybe a significantly bigger number as you get into the heavy leasing season and maybe that will be another driving force to you upticking your guidance, just a better market rent growth trajectory than you expected? If you could comment on that, please.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I mean I think, Rich, you can look at that and say the 3.25% sequential build from January 1 is about where we peg where we should be of what a normal cycle is. The 3% for the full year, remember, you got to blend in what happens due in that first quarter and the fourth quarter. So when you put it all into the blender, could you be up at a 4%, 4.5% in the peak leasing season? Sure. And you still could average to the 3% for the full year.  So I think I would just look at the trajectory that we see the sequential build of application volume and the sequential build of this net effective pricing trend is basically resulting in us being right on top of where we thought we would be from the blended rate growth, which is what manifests itself to the P&L.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.\nBradley Heffern: Circling back on bad debt. So it was 1.7% of revenue in the first quarter, excluding the assistance payments. But you obviously mentioned that it improved in March and April. So I'm curious if you can just compare the whatever leading-edge figure you have to that 1.7%.\nRobert Garechana: Yes. So that would probably be -- the 1.7% would probably be something, call it, 20 basis points better, maybe a little bit more, maybe 30.\nBradley Heffern: Okay. Perfect. And then going back to next question. You gave the 3% employed by Big Tech in LA figure. I'm curious if you have the figures handy for the Bay Area and for Seattle and if there are any other markets like, I don't know, New York that have a larger number too.\nMark Parrell: Yes. I've got some numbers for you. I don't have the East Coast, but the Bay Area is about 14%. And Seattle is about 30%.\nOperator: Next question comes from Haendel Juste from Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: A couple for me. I guess first question is can you provide the new and renewal numbers for March specifically? And where are you sending out renewal rates today for May? And what's the loss to lease in the portfolio today?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Okay. So let me just start with loss to lease. So we snapshot that on the 15th of every month. By April 15, we were at 3.4%, which basically compares to, I think we are 1.5% on January 15 again, trending in line with where you would have expected it to be.  In terms of like the March, April, I will tell you both new lease and renewals are basically flat when you look at it sequentially. You look at the blended rate, and you can see that we're moving from a 3.8% in March to a 4.0% expected in April. So again, right in line with what we would think based on the sequential build heading into the peak leasing season.  If I look forward to think about transactions that are on the books for May, so we have renewals on the books, we've got some expected move-ins for leases that just haven't started yet. Those are also trending in line with what you would expect, which you're starting to see that improvement kick into gear on new lease change and you got that consistency on renewal. In terms of the forward view on renewals, we've got quotes sitting out there for the next 90 days. I think I said in the prepared remarks, we really do expect a lot of consistency here. We're renewing about 55% to 60%. We don't see any reason not to expect that in the next several months going forward. We're achieving somewhere in this 5.5% to 6% achieved renewal rate increase each month. We don't see a significant change there. We have a lot of confidence in this renewal process. My expectation is we turn to corner to the second half of the year. We do expect to see a little bit of moderation on renewals, probably more like in that 4% to 5% range, which is just a function of the comp period and what we see as we return to more of a normal pricing trend.\nHaendel St. Juste: Very helpful. Another question on, I guess, some of the charges in the quarter. It sounds like the property, legal and admin charges are tied to the eviction process, but can you comment on the other charges, the $5 million environment settlement and the $2 million data transformation project and if we should expect those in future quarters, too.\nMark Parrell: And I'll start. Bob will help here a little. The data transformation project is something we're working on. We mentioned this before in prior calls. It's a big data analytics project with an outside vendor. You can expect a couple of million dollars more there and then it should be at an end.  All of our internal employee hires and all that, that's in our normal overhead load. So continuing costs are in the run rate of the business. The sort of discrete onetime sort of events are separately categorized, as we said on the Page 24 of the release. And I don't know, Bob, if you want to comment on the risk.\nRobert Garechana: Yes. The other components are adjustments to various kind of regular course litigation reserves that we made during the quarter as we got more information and adjusted our outlook. So those are all case-by-case dependent and depend on facts and circumstances at the moment.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. And one more question on cost. Is there any part of the property damage from the cost in California at the rain storms. Any part of that recoverable perhaps from insurance?\nMark Parrell: No, this all falls, it's Mark, below our deductible handouts. So this is all covered by us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So two questions. First, on the insurance, you guys mentioned that and we've heard from others that insurance has become more challenging, expensive, especially in like Florida and Texas. So 2 parts to this. In your experience, do you would expect that the insurance provider will rapidly adjust new capital come in and that this won't really be a problem? Or do you think that it's actually could give you some opportunities to buy deals where the existing owner can't get insurance on their property and therefore, provides you guys with some opportunity to buy some of those in some of the expansion markets.\nMark Parrell: It's Mark. It's a good question. The insurance market typically has, as you suggested, when you see costs go up as much as this capacity has gone up. We don't yet see that. And the difference now is that fixed income is a real alternative. I mean folks that are reinsurers can invest in a lot of different things. And the fixed income market and maybe even these beaten down equity values may be more interesting to them. So there's a little more competition for those reinsurance dollars that investment. So in the off-season here because we just renewed our policy program -- our property program last month, Alex, we're going to be out there looking for other capacity in other places because I'm not sure given the severity of this named windstorm risk that we're going to be able to find additional capacity for that risk. Now EQR doesn't have Florida exposure, and we don't have that risk, but it has impacted other spots in the market. And other folks have much larger increases than we had. Ours was about 20% on our property program. So I would say I would expect normally for the market to get bigger, I wonder this time how quickly that's going to occur, given concerns that these sort of wind storms, especially are going to be more continuous than they've been in the past and just alternatives that insurers have and reinsurers have to invest elsewhere. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nAlexander Goldfarb: That is. The second question is the tax deal that you did in Atlanta, you guys have previously spoken about the 421a is here in New York and the drag it cost to earnings when those tax incentives dried up -- or sorry, matured off -- burned off. Do you see similar with the Atlanta and in general, are you looking to do more tax deals or your preferences to shy away from them except where on a case-by-case basis.\nMark Parrell: Yes, a great question. We certainly like not to repeat things like that. You got to look at the IRR in the deal. You start with these elevated cash flows, you're getting a little bit better cap rate because of the fact that later on, you're going to be paying these higher taxes. So for us in year 8 or 9, taxes are going to go up and you're going to really have this flatten out. But it's not the order of magnitude of the 421a program. So -- and we also keep track, Alex, of these. So we're not allowing any 1 year to be overburdened. So we don't feel like we're robbing Peter to pay Paul as long as we're comfortable with our IRR. So as our overall IRR, we being paid upfront, for the cash flow growth flatness that will occur 8, 9, 10 years from now. And I think we feel like we were, and we'll do deals like that.  And most of the new product is going to have stuff like this. So we'll also buy some stuff that's a little bit older. Alex and his team are looking at those kind of deals as well where you won't have that but if you have an older deal, remember, you're going to be putting in a lot more capital. So it's not possible to avoid some sort of cost here because if we bought something 10 years old that had fully stabilized taxes in Atlanta, it probably would require more capital, and that would affect the IRR. So we're going to look at the IRR and use that as our check on that.\nAlexander Brackenridge: And in some cases, Alex, this is Alex. As the abatement burns off or when it burns off, some of the units might go to market. So you got to pick up there, too. So it's not all downside.\nOperator: And Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo.\nJames Feldman: I guess just big picture to your comments on maybe assets come to market for investment. Your leverage tick lower in the quarter. It looks like you've been met -- this year, you plan to match fund acquisitions with dispositions. To the extent you want to put incremental capital to work beyond asset sales just because you see so much opportunity. Can you just talk about the sources of capital to do that, you're having conversations with potential JV partners? If so, what kind of capital looks interested? And then what would you be willing to do in terms of leverage? And how do you think about your liquidity position today for investment?\nMark Parrell: So first off, there isn't such a significant opportunity out there that it's worth using our precious leverage capacity or issuing a bunch of equity below what we think the intrinsic worth of the business is. So I haven't been presented yet with that issue. Talking to the Board, we're certainly willing to take leverage up. We have a stated leverage policy, Bob?\nRobert Garechana: By 5 to 6x net debt to EBITDA.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And we're approaching 3x so into the 3x. So I would say to you that there are several billion dollars of capacity in the system to buy great assets at great prices using debt when and if we see those opportunities, and we're looking hard for those. We don't see them yet. But I'd start with debt. But certainly, the JV market is another source of capital. We're very aware of that. The private market continues to love the apartment industry, even if the public markets are being buffeted a little bit by some of these cross wins. So we're out there looking for other sources of capital for sure.\nJames Feldman: And can you talk about the returns that private market is looking for. Are those sources of capital are looking for? How are they underwriting apartments today? And what kind of trends are they looking for?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Generally, there -- this is Alex. Generally, they're looking for the same kind of return, a cap rate of, say, 5%, 5.25%, depending on the assets that we would see in the transactions market.\nJames Feldman: Okay. And then finally, I mean, to your comments and everyone's comments, I mean, there's so much talk about supply. When you just think about the next 6 months, 9 months or 12 months, 24 months, like when do you think the supply chain really starts to kick in based on the delivery scale?\nMark Parrell: Just to make sure I understand the question. When do we think supply will start going down based on deliveries? I'm sorry, didn't near the end of that.\nJames Feldman: No. I mean I know in your comments, you feel somewhat protected from supply based on where your assets are located. But clearly, a very large pipeline set to deliver over the next 2 years. When do you think that supply really starts to be felt nationally? It certainly doesn't feel [indiscernible] several months.\nMark Parrell: I think you've got the stuff it's going to get completed. I would say you're looking more in like '25 and '26. I mean stuff you start now -- I mean, if you've got your capital stack and you're able to start, you're going to deliver. I mean, you may deliver a quarter late because of the supply chain, but you're going to deliver. So I think the starts Alex referred to, will impact '25's count will be lower and '26's count will be lower but stuff for this year and next, that's expected to deliver will deliver. And I think some of the numbers in some of the markets, some of which we're interested in, like Denver and Austin are really large.  And that's a terrific opportunity for us to buy. And to sell some of these assets where we're overallocated in some of the coastal markets. And I think that's going to be an attractive play for us.\nOperator: And John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: I realize unemployment remains pretty healthy. It seems like demand is going very well for you guys. There have been some reports of employers delaying start dates for new hires. And I'm wondering if you've seen any softness in demand as it pertains to the upcoming graduate pool?\nMichael Manelis: John, this is Michael. I don't -- I haven't heard that. I mean I did hear a few kind of comments from prospects around what time they're looking for. So typically, they're showing uptake in tours. And these folks were thinking more like the June, July timeframe. There's definitely a little pause in the prospects decision-making process right now around, are there going to be more layoffs, will they actually get the offer to start when they want it. But it's nothing of a material nature because, again, our sequential build of application volumes, our foot traffic year-over-year, all of those things are trending in line with what we would say is a normal seasonal pattern. So we haven't seen anything like that.\nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question is, I think, for Bob, but on the litigation reserve that you incurred this quarter, is this something that may be ongoing? And is this related to RealPage?\nMark Parrell: Yes, it's Mark. I'll take that. So being in a consumer-facing business, there's always some level of litigation costs. They're widely varying. There's no significant amount of RealPage related costs in there, but they are in there, but it's relatively small. The reason for that is that the case is at its early stages. And you should think about that going on for a longer period of time.  They aren't resolved in weeks or months. It's more like years. But again, we feel very strongly about our position. We think these claims are without merit, and we're going to defend ourselves, and we continue to feel really confident in our prospects there. So there is some small amount, but it's small. Most of that just relates to just continuing legal costs from being in a customer-facing business in an industry that has regulation.\nOperator: Next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: Yes, I just wanted to ask about this California storm damage kind of cost. Look, I appreciate kind of the disclosure around 1Q impacts. Wondering just on if there will be further impacts in particular, if you could kind of quantify maybe the 2Q impacts or any other impacts going forward?\nRobert Garechana: Yes. Thanks, Adam. It's Bob. Our expectation is that there won't be anything material going forward into Q2 related to these specific storms. Obviously, if there's a different event, then we don't know. But as it relates to this, there's nothing material that's moving the numbers soon for Q2.\nAdam Kramer: Great. And then just on thinking through occupancy and kind of the occupancy versus renewal, renewal kind of pushing renewals kind of trade off. Look, recognizing occupancy, there's some drivers there in terms of physical occupancy, right, kind of what's happening on the on the bad debt and eviction side.  But just thinking through how was that kind of -- that trade-off that you guys going through, right, managing occupancy versus pushing renewals? How would that conversation maybe evolved from 4Q to 1Q to today? Is there a change in kind of how you're approaching that and how much you're kind of willing or able to push renewals?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Well, I think you could see just that sequential build that we have right now and the achieved renewal increase shows that we are pushing on that front. I mean every market has a different balance act that's going on between the trade-offs of occupancy and renewals. I mean for us, the preference clearly would be to continue to renew as many residents as possible because, one, we avoid the turn cost; and two, we avoid the vacancy loss with that. So you're seeing us do a little bit more negotiation across many of the markets right now. But again, we're well positioned, which gives us that confidence to keep kind of pushing on that rate in the marketplace that not only fuels the new lease change, but also helps the future months renewals as well. So I think this trade-off is constantly balanced. And honestly, we're looking at these markets every week going through that conversation now that we have the centralized renewal team, which is which way are we leaning.\nOperator: And Linda Tsai from Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: I know you just emphasized IRR of individual deals, but the higher taxes and insurance occurring in the expansion markets, does this shift the attractiveness of these regions long term?\nMark Parrell: There's no riskless apartment market, and it's Mark. I'll start, and Alex may supplement it. I mean, if you're buying in some markets, you're going to have higher insurance costs, but maybe lower political risk.  And then another market, you may have slightly higher political risk and a lot better resilience and maybe a better supply picture. Our whole investment thought process of being diversified is premised on the idea of kind of accepting these risks in small doses across the whole country and staying tied to these affluent renters so it doesn't change our mind.  We just underwrite it and the deals will either work or they won't. I do think that some of the markets that have outperformed lately in the Sunbelt that have resilience challenges are really going to be pressed by these insurance costs. And frankly, maybe even the availability of financing if insurance is unavailable at some of the issue lenders are very sensitive to. But from our point of view, I mean, we're just going to run the numbers. I think these markets continue to have other subjective factors that are valuable to us. And I think they're going to remain investable the ones that we're interested in, for sure.\nLinda Tsai: And then just on the strength you're seeing in New York and Atlanta. Could you talk about that a little more?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I mean -- this is Michael. I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, New York, the strength is really kind of widespread across all of the submarkets where you have good demand, you have pricing power, you have the sequential build of the demand and rents moving up with really strong kind of results, both on the retention as well as the achieved renewal increase. In Atlanta, I think right now, relative to our expectations, we feel really good. We're not having that like direct supply pressure on us. We're not seeing kind of heavy use of concessions in our portfolio, and we have demand. And even the deals that we're looking at, one that we have to go through the lease-up or finish the lease-up on, we got a lot of confidence in the velocity, the weekly velocity of application volume there that they're going to perform really well.\nOperator: Omotayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. On just capital recycling and the updated guidance there. I get it of buying assets that higher cap rates and selling us at a lower cap rate and kind of creating value that way. But I'm curious with your implied cap at like 6% at this point, according to our math, you did make some comments earlier on about kind of development starts slowing because that development doesn't tend to allow. How do you kind of think about that on the other side of the story, which is the acquisition side, are still -- is the idea still things are not going to be able to kind of pencil out for a while? And unless you're kind of matching asset sales versus acquisitions, you don't expect to kind of be doing much out there on the acquisition side as well?\nAlexander Brackenridge: It's really -- as you said -- Tayo, this is Alex, about matching the sales and the acquisition. So we keep track of that. We don't get ahead of ourselves on either side and just match them up and it's a neutral bet, but we feel like we're accomplishing our goal of diversifying the footprint.\nOmotayo Okusanya: And the focus from an acquisition perspective remains in your newer markets rather than some of the more established markets.\nAlexander Brackenridge: Quiet primarily, but also in the sub of our established markets. And as we've talked about, being opportunistic, there may be opportunities that come up. There's more dislocation that are appealing anywhere and we would chase those.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay. That's helpful. Would there be any interest in doing something in regards to office to resi conversion from your end or just the development risk and everything is just way too great for you?\nMark Parrell: Well, I'm going to split it up because there's the urban conversion of these office buildings that are really giant 1-block floor plates. It's very challenging in urban locations to take a property on LaSalle Street in Chicago or in Midtown Manhattan, it spans a block and doesn't have a lot of windows relative to the total floor space, doesn't have a lot of plumbing fixtures. There's been work done by engineering firms in Boston, for example, on this. And there's relatively few of these buildings -- these large buildings that are going to work as repositioning plays. They may work if the building isn't there anymore, but they're just taking that building and some of our reengineering it is going to be tough. In the suburbs, you may -- and this has been common in the Bay Area and in suburban Washington. You may scrape an office park and build apartments there. And we've been involved in those sort of plays, but those are different altogether because you're not reusing the building. So I think reusing an office building is tough in an urban situation just because of the need for plumbing fixtures in the unit and the need for windows that these larger office buildings just don't allow very well. But I would say, as urban owners, we'd like to see the central business district -- office districts thrive. I mean they pay taxes that support transit, that support public safety, we want those to be repositioned.  It will just take more time and likely be more costly and extensive than some observers seem to think. I just don't think you can snap your finger and take a 4-year-old office building and turn it into a livable awesome apartment building in the center of whether it's Manhattan or the center of Los Angeles. So we'll kind of play wait-and-see on that, but urban repositionings for us are not likely in place.\nAlexander Brackenridge: And in New York, downtown where it was done a lot. That was on the back of a tax abatement that since expired. The 421g was specifically to promote the conversion. So it doesn't happen easily and it does need -- it generally does need public policy support.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I just wanted to touch base on the new lease change in April relative to 1Q. It looks like it kind of stepped up 30 basis points. How does that compare to kind of the typical acceleration in April versus 1Q?\nMichael Manelis: I don't know if I looked historically back, I will tell you it's sitting right on top of what we modeled at the beginning of the year, which is what we would say more like a 2019, 2018 kind of curve and expectation. Some of this just has to do with the timing of who moved out? What was their previous lease? So when I look at the 30 basis points growth, I would just tell you any time you look at these statistics or these metrics on such a short time period of time, it does create some volatility with it. So we tend to look at this over the longer stretch. And right now, I've said this a couple of that, we're sitting right where we kind of modeled for the year and write what we would expect based on just the normal sequential build.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. It sounds like concessions use picked up in March and April in Yale in San Francisco. If you stripped out those 2 markets, how is kind of new lease rate trending?\nMichael Manelis: I think the impact on the overall portfolio was like 20 or 30 basis points on the net effective, like new lease change. So if you just pulled out those 2 markets with the heavy concession use, I think that was what the impact was.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. And then just digging down into same-store expenses, I don't think we've touched on the other on-site operating expenses on the call. I think that's where kind of people kind of use flow through for the evictions. What's kind of the expectation in that line item going into 2Q, just given the move-outs?\nRobert Garechana: Yes. Josh, it's Bob. Our expectation is that, that could be pretty bumpy because -- if you think about the expense, the expense is really in advance, oftentimes is in advance of the actual move-out. So it depends on how quickly and how fast the cases get filed, which we've made a good amount of progress faster than what we thought in the first quarter.  We'll have some go into the second quarter. That line item is normally a line item that barely grows for us. And so it will be bumpy because of this elevated activity, but it will be lumpy. So just expect it to be kind of grow above trend relative to history and be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, hopefully tailing off as we get to the back end of the year.\nOperator: And there's no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to Mark for additional and closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nMark Parrell: All right. Well, thank you all for your time on the call today and for your interest in Equity Residential. Good day.\nOperator: Everyone else has left the call. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to review key takeaways from our first quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets, along with same-store operating expenses. As Mark mentioned, we produced very good same-store revenue growth of 9.2% in the first quarter. These results were ahead of our expectations, primarily due to continuing improvement in delinquency along with continued healthy fundamentals in the business. Before I get into more details on these topics, I want to emphasize that as we sit here today, the early stages of the leasing season and its setup remains strong. With year-to-date pricing trend improvement just above 3.25%, which is where we would expect it to be at this point in the year and is also consistent with expectations underpinning guidance. During the quarter, we continued to see good demand and strong resident retention that produced low turnover, stable occupancy and solid pricing power.  Despite some recent negative job headlines, our average resident remains in great financial shape. With rent income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. The Resident lease breaks due to job loss and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic threats remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. A resilient labor market, along with a large number of young adults choosing the exciting attractive lifestyles our markets provide, along with the convenience and cost benefits of renting continues to result in application volumes that are on par with the same period last year and continue to grow as expected into the leasing season. Couple this with the favorable supply position and lack of single-family home ownership competition that Mark outlined, and we should be positioned for another good year. Results to date support the view we shared on our February earnings call that we expect pricing trends for this year to follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory. Given the difficult comparison periods for 2022 for the back half of the year, along with the return to normal rent growth patterns, we expect that the first quarter will be our highest reported same-store revenue growth with more moderate but still above historical growth in subsequent quarters. While there may be some uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, as I said previously, we are not seeing this impact our day-to-day operations. While we acknowledge that we are generally a lagging indicator, so far so good as we head to our primary leasing season. Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our market performance. Let's start with the East Coast. New York and D.C. are both exceeding expectations, while Boston is in line. New York was by far the top performer for the first quarter with same-store revenue growth of over 19%. With very limited and isolated supply, the outperformance in this market is consistent across all submarkets. Occupancy is currently 97.5% and all demand indicators continue to flash green, making this market the expected top performer for the year. Turning to D.C. Performance has thus far been a pleasant surprise with the market continuing to absorb significant new supply, while still delivering good revenue growth. Similar to New York, occupancy is strong, and so far, all submarkets remain resilient in the face of new supply. Now for the West Coast, Southern California continues to post good numbers. And most notably, we are starting to see improvement in delinquency, particularly in Los Angeles, which has the heaviest concentration. As the eviction moratorium expired, we are seeing more of our delinquent residents figuring out the best option that works for them, which is either paying rent or moving out. This activity started to pick up pace late in the first quarter, which was sooner than we expected and has continued into April. While these move-outs are pressuring physical occupancy, it will benefit our financial results later in the year as we have good demand in the market to replace these residents with new residents that will pay their rent. Our remaining 2 West Coast markets of San Francisco and Seattle have posted respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth with good demand, but pricing power remains less than desired, especially in the urban centers of both of these markets. The San Francisco market is performing in line with our expectations, which already assumed a slow recovery. Use of concessions, mostly in the downtown submarket remains common along with limited pricing power. Meanwhile, the South Bay submarket is demonstrating signs of improving pricing power and stronger occupancy with less widespread concession use based on a combination of factors that includes a greater variety of stable employers who are committed to the area, coupled with just a better overall quality of life. Heading to Seattle, the overall market continues to demonstrate a lack of recovery, which wasn't completely unexpected, but is behind our forecast. Similar to Downtown San Francisco, Downtown Seattle lacks pricing power with concessions being used on over 70% of our applications. The East side, which we felt may hold up a little bit better, is still outperforming downtown, but is a little more challenging than we thought based on supply pressure, layoffs and overall just less hiring in the submarket. Amazon's May 1 mandatory return to the office date has a potential to be a catalyst for this market. Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up a little less than 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has mostly been in line with our acquisition performance and guidance expectations. As we expected, we are being impacted by heavy new supply in Austin, Dallas and Denver. Meanwhile, Atlanta remained strong with double-digit revenue growth for the quarter. Now moving to expenses. We reported same-store expense growth of 7.2% in the quarter, which was slightly above our expectations. We had always expected Q1 growth to be higher than our full year guidance range, mostly because the growth during the first quarter of 2022 was so low, but also from pressure on a few specific items that outpaced positives in a few other expense categories. On the favorable side, we continue to benefit from good performance in real estate taxes and payroll, along with utilities, which were still elevated but lower than expected. On the unfavorable side, incremental cost in repairs and maintenance, other on-site costs and higher-than-anticipated insurance costs drove higher-than-expected first quarter same-store expense growth. For most of these costs, we had anticipated an increase but not quite to this degree. Elevated repairs and maintenance was in large part due to increased outsourcing in the quarter much of which stemmed from our own internal teams in California, focusing on the after effects of the severe rainstorms, which resulted in incremental outside vendor assistance.  Higher legal and administrative costs related to faster progress in response to the expiration of the eviction moratorium, the benefit of which can be seen in our bad debt net. Insurance expense was higher due to tougher conditions than the already challenging environment we assumed on the renewal of our property insurance policy, which was completed during the first quarter. Despite this pressure, we remain comfortable with our existing guidance range on the full year same-store expense growth. At this point, we expect slower full year growth in real estate tax and utilities than we initially expected to offset the overages experienced in other categories in the first quarter. Lastly, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation and the technology evolution of our platform. In 2023, we have a positive NOI impact of just over $10 million included in our guidance with about 2/3 of that coming on the expense side primarily in payroll and repair and maintenance. This benefit will mostly be realized in second half of the year which will contribute to lower expense growth for that period. On the revenue side we will continue to focus on other income items like WiFi, parking and pricing optimization. We will also leverage data analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margins. Our vision is to augment pricing and renewal strategies by combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution while delivering self-service solutions to our customers. We will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create opportunities to share on-site employees across multiple properties. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment and rapidly scale what works across the portfolio. This uniquely positions our company to continue to create additional revenue streams while managing expenses to maintain and grow margins even in an inflationary climate. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Thank you. Yes. Eric, this is Michael. So I think there's 2 factors. One, the way that the rents are moving, and I said, albeit a little bit muted, that's more indicative to when we think about normal rent patterns of pricing trends. We came into the year with our guidance expecting the sequential build. We just didn't think we were going to see kind of outsized momentum anywhere near the pace that we saw last year. And in terms of the setup right now, I guess I would just say the portfolio is sitting at 96.1% today. We've got great momentum. The blended rate for April sitting right at 4%, you get the sequential build and pricing trend at 3.25%, which basically positions us right where we thought we would be heading into this peak leasing season. Yes. I mean I think I would carve them out a little bit different. So Denver, you clearly have supply pressure sitting on top of us in the downtown submarket, but yet the suburban portfolios are actually doing pretty well. When we go into the Texas markets, we clearly are seeing just more concessions being used. You have demand, right? But when you look at across all of these expansion markets, any of the reported data, including our own portfolio, which again is a pretty small subset. It's less than 5% of the company's NOI. The occupancies tend to be running lower in these kind of expansion markets for us. The one exception I would say for us is Atlanta, seems to be doing a little bit better than even what we thought coming into the year. We just don't have quite as much supply pressure on us. So we see a little bit better pricing power than what we thought. Oh, I mean I think clearly, our coastal markets right now are set up not even for this year, but just the entire setup, the demand drivers that we see, the cost of housing in those markets has really positioned them to outperform. But again, as we went into these sunbelt, we knew like what to expect for these first couple of years. So for us, the positive is that -- the large majority of our acquisitions are trending slightly ahead of how we perform in them and clearly in line with our expectations for this year. Yes. Well, maybe I'll start, and Bob, you can kind of build a little bit on the bad debt. So in terms of just the leasing spreads and kind of guide, a lot of that had to do with where we were with our embedded growth, where we were with loss to lease, capturing the loss to lease. And I think I said, right, as we were working through the call back in February, we expected roughly 2%, 2.25% on new lease change for the full year, renewals right around 5% and blended is right around 4% for the full year. When you look at where we sit today, we're set up going into our peak leasing season, where, again, we're going to do 60% of the transaction. We're set up right where we thought we would be relative to the guidance. We have a little bit of pressure that we're doing more concessions in those downtown submarkets in Seattle and San Francisco. But that's kind of being offset by some of the outperformance we're seeing in the East Coast markets. Yes. Chandni, it's Michael. So we clearly have evictions filed right now with the courts. You are seeing a little bit of momentum pick up. I would tell you across the country right now, it feels like most of this stuff is set up at about a 6-month timeframe from the time you file to the time you actually get to your proceeding with a court date.  But really what's happening on the collections front is twofold. So one, you have individuals that you are filing on that have a lot of past balances with you. But if they start paying you current month's rent, those past balances are somewhat protected still to date and go out into like '24. I think maybe some of them even stretch into '25. So you have a little bit of a longer tail to go after the previous balances to collect. But we are starting to see this resident behavior where they're making decisions either to move out in front of any kind of eviction proceeding or actually just start paying us their current month's rent knowing that we're ultimately going to have to come to terms with what happens with this previous balance. In areas where those balances are not protected, we have sent much of that over to the collection agencies and let collection agencies start working.  That's a slow process because typically, what you need to see is a lifestyle change. You need to see somebody needing to go buy a car or a home or some other thing that then causes them to come to terms that they got to clean up that balance. So I think what you should expect to see is the court system is going to continue to move at this pace of, call it, the 6-month window. And you'll see us gradually just start chipping away at this delinquency and gradually start to improve the recovery of this -- of the past balance. Yes. So Michael, this is Michael. So concessions for us right now are really concentrated in those urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. I think what you saw when we turned the corner into January, and we were getting on that first -- or the fourth quarter call, I was telling you that the demand was picking up, and you saw the concessions starting to slow down across most of the markets that absolutely held true almost all of the markets now have weaned themselves off of the concessions, except what we saw in somewhere around that middle of February and into March, you really saw the concession use pick up in those downtown urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco, and they've been fairly constant. I'll tell you the last couple of weeks, we see a little bit of hope right now that the demand is picking up. Application volume is picking up in those areas, and you could start to see us get to a place where we could start pulling them back again. But for the most part, just in the rearview mirror, they've been constant for the last couple of months for us. Yes. And I think, one, you got to put into context that the reported turnover for the first quarter was really low. I mean it's not quite record little, but it's really low number. So the absolute number of move-outs that we're having is clearly below any kind of historical norms. And when we start drilling in and we look at those reasons for move-out, we're really not seeing anything indicative of changes. You're not seeing kind of job loss or job change pick up anything different than what you would expect for the first quarter of any given year. Specific into like a Seattle or San Francisco where you saw kind of more of the headlines and we said on the last call, we thought a lot of those layoffs were being dispersed across the country, not just heavily concentrated in those markets. I think what you've seen, we have not seen anybody really give us keys telling us they're breaking the lease or they're not renewing because they were laid off.  What we do notice in those 2 markets is the in-migration, meaning what percent of brand new residents are coming to us from outside of that MSA. The in-migration in those 2 areas is less than what you otherwise would have expected, which I think makes sense given not only the layoffs, but more importantly, like the hiring freezes that have been taking place. So you're just not seeing them draw into the market like they used to. Yes. I mean I think, Rich, you can look at that and say the 3.25% sequential build from January 1 is about where we peg where we should be of what a normal cycle is. The 3% for the full year, remember, you got to blend in what happens due in that first quarter and the fourth quarter. So when you put it all into the blender, could you be up at a 4%, 4.5% in the peak leasing season? Sure. And you still could average to the 3% for the full year.  So I think I would just look at the trajectory that we see the sequential build of application volume and the sequential build of this net effective pricing trend is basically resulting in us being right on top of where we thought we would be from the blended rate growth, which is what manifests itself to the P&L. Yes. Okay. So let me just start with loss to lease. So we snapshot that on the 15th of every month. By April 15, we were at 3.4%, which basically compares to, I think we are 1.5% on January 15 again, trending in line with where you would have expected it to be.  In terms of like the March, April, I will tell you both new lease and renewals are basically flat when you look at it sequentially. You look at the blended rate, and you can see that we're moving from a 3.8% in March to a 4.0% expected in April. So again, right in line with what we would think based on the sequential build heading into the peak leasing season.  If I look forward to think about transactions that are on the books for May, so we have renewals on the books, we've got some expected move-ins for leases that just haven't started yet. Those are also trending in line with what you would expect, which you're starting to see that improvement kick into gear on new lease change and you got that consistency on renewal. In terms of the forward view on renewals, we've got quotes sitting out there for the next 90 days. I think I said in the prepared remarks, we really do expect a lot of consistency here. We're renewing about 55% to 60%. We don't see any reason not to expect that in the next several months going forward. We're achieving somewhere in this 5.5% to 6% achieved renewal rate increase each month. We don't see a significant change there. We have a lot of confidence in this renewal process. My expectation is we turn to corner to the second half of the year. We do expect to see a little bit of moderation on renewals, probably more like in that 4% to 5% range, which is just a function of the comp period and what we see as we return to more of a normal pricing trend. John, this is Michael. I don't -- I haven't heard that. I mean I did hear a few kind of comments from prospects around what time they're looking for. So typically, they're showing uptake in tours. And these folks were thinking more like the June, July timeframe. There's definitely a little pause in the prospects decision-making process right now around, are there going to be more layoffs, will they actually get the offer to start when they want it. But it's nothing of a material nature because, again, our sequential build of application volumes, our foot traffic year-over-year, all of those things are trending in line with what we would say is a normal seasonal pattern. So we haven't seen anything like that. Yes. Well, I think you could see just that sequential build that we have right now and the achieved renewal increase shows that we are pushing on that front. I mean every market has a different balance act that's going on between the trade-offs of occupancy and renewals. I mean for us, the preference clearly would be to continue to renew as many residents as possible because, one, we avoid the turn cost; and two, we avoid the vacancy loss with that. So you're seeing us do a little bit more negotiation across many of the markets right now. But again, we're well positioned, which gives us that confidence to keep kind of pushing on that rate in the marketplace that not only fuels the new lease change, but also helps the future months renewals as well. So I think this trade-off is constantly balanced. And honestly, we're looking at these markets every week going through that conversation now that we have the centralized renewal team, which is which way are we leaning. Yes. I mean -- this is Michael. I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, New York, the strength is really kind of widespread across all of the submarkets where you have good demand, you have pricing power, you have the sequential build of the demand and rents moving up with really strong kind of results, both on the retention as well as the achieved renewal increase. In Atlanta, I think right now, relative to our expectations, we feel really good. We're not having that like direct supply pressure on us. We're not seeing kind of heavy use of concessions in our portfolio, and we have demand. And even the deals that we're looking at, one that we have to go through the lease-up or finish the lease-up on, we got a lot of confidence in the velocity, the weekly velocity of application volume there that they're going to perform really well. I don't know if I looked historically back, I will tell you it's sitting right on top of what we modeled at the beginning of the year, which is what we would say more like a 2019, 2018 kind of curve and expectation. Some of this just has to do with the timing of who moved out? What was their previous lease? So when I look at the 30 basis points growth, I would just tell you any time you look at these statistics or these metrics on such a short time period of time, it does create some volatility with it. So we tend to look at this over the longer stretch. And right now, I've said this a couple of that, we're sitting right where we kind of modeled for the year and write what we would expect based on just the normal sequential build. I think the impact on the overall portfolio was like 20 or 30 basis points on the net effective, like new lease change. So if you just pulled out those 2 markets with the heavy concession use, I think that was what the impact was."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2023 results. We had a very good quarter to start the year with same-store revenue results exceeding our expectations. And while same-store expense growth was higher than we projected due in large part to California storms, that still left us with first quarter net operating income and normalized FFO better than we expected. In a moment, Mike will take you through our first quarter operating highlights. The strength of our revenue results point to the durable nature of our business in the face of volatile economic conditions.  We continue to see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic and moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets, with the new news in the quarter being the rapidly improving regulatory conditions in California. Based on these continuing positive business conditions and the good prospects we see for our business going forward, during the first quarter, our board raised our common share dividend by 6% on an annualized basis. Despite headlines and layoffs, demand feels solid.  The unemployment rate, particularly for the college educated, remains very low, which gives us a good feeling about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. In our portfolio, we are not seeing increases in residents downsizing their units or giving us their keys because of job loss. In terms of competition from homeownership, monthly costs and down payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making renting a high-quality equity residential apartment a better value. Only 8% of our residents who moved out in the first quarter bought a home, and that's down from 12% in the first quarter of 2022. On the apartment supply side, as we have discussed with you on previous calls, we expect 2023 national apartment new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the level of direct competition that supply will pose to us, given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties. In our coastal markets where we still have 95% of our NOI, we see very manageable competitive new supply in most markets, with Washington, D.C. being the exception, though D.C. is holding up remarkably well so far.  In the Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing. And in Denver, we are seeing higher relative supply and more impact. We anticipated this when we acquired our Sunbelt in Denver properties, and these properties are generally tracking consistently with our underwriting.  As we look to expand our portfolio in these markets, we expect that these new deliveries will present buying opportunities for us. Mike will also discuss first quarter same-store expense growth, which was higher than we expected, especially in the repairs and maintenance and other on-site operating expenses lines.  We think this growth was inflated for discrete reasons that will pass, and we continue to be comfortable in attaining our full year same-store expense range in part due to lower than previously anticipated real estate tax growth, combined with modest on-site payroll expense growth. We have created at our company a culture and system that uses technology and centralization to improve the customer and employee experience and to contain our payroll costs.  While the transaction markets remain unsettled, we did do a couple of deals to start the year. We sold a small collection of 25-year-old properties that totaled 247 units in Los Angeles for about $135 million in advance of the transfer tax increase. Also after the end of the quarter, we purchased a newly developed property in Atlanta for about $79 million that is currently in lease-up. The property is located directly on a portion of the Atlanta beltline that is being improved and paved. The beltline is a desirable amenity to our demographic and has been a catalyst for economic growth and densification across the area. The property's economics benefit from various tax credits and when fully stabilized next year, we expect to attain a 6.6% acquisition cap rate. Removing the tax benefits, which will burn off over time, we see the stabilized fully taxed acquisition cap rate at 5.7%. We also love our basis in this property, which is at $288,000 per unit, and we see that as a 15% to 20% discount to current replacement costs. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us to answer your questions on the transaction market. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Yes. Just to supplement that, Eric, it's Mark. It's the difference between guidance when we gave our guidance, we talked about the year being kind of like a normal year 2023, but maybe a little bit less of intra-period growth and what's going on so far this year. And so far this year, absolutely consistent with that expectation. So it's -- those 2 terms are being used to describe different things, guidance versus so far so good this year. And Steve, it's Mark. Just to help you with your mod a little. The governmental payments are really key to the volatility because in the first quarter of '22, we got about $9.5 million of governmental rental relief. In the second quarter, we got almost $15 million in 2022. So we need to make up that difference in terms of improved delinquency performance in the second quarter. And then you drop all the way down to a little below $6 million in the third quarter and then only $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. So you can see that those rental relief payments are key to understanding. So the delinquency, we think, will improve the whole year, but there could be quarters where bad debt net because it's being compared to a number with so much governmental rental relief in it is just not as good as it appears to be, and then the next quarter, you'll see it even back out. Yes. And Steve, it's Mark. Just to supplement that. I mean all this supply in the Sunbelt markets, Denver, places we'd like more long-term exposure, but we recognize that it's going to be a tough couple of years, that's an opportunity for us. I mean we're going to sell low performing assets in the coastal markets are assets where we have an over concentration in the sub market and kind of trade in and accepting that there might be a little near-term decline and putting it in the pro forma. But as you said, I mean, I'm very hopeful. I think we're in a really good spot where our numbers are going to show well comparatively in the costal markets, we'll exercise our usual good expense control, and then we'll turn around and deploy capital. And Alex got a big team, a very capable, experienced people out there ready to buy. So I think we'll be active as soon as those opportunities are more substantial. Yes. Chandni, it's Mark. And just to supplement Alex answer. We -- I mean, it certainly impacts the tactical way to get to the success to lower that exposure. But mean we remain committed to the goal, and we're just going to figure out different ways to do it. And again, maybe you're selling properties in Ventura County instead or in -- outside the city of San Francisco and the County of Los Angeles, and we have plenty of those, too. So we've got other levers to pull, and we'll be thoughtful about that. Yes, Nick, it's Mark. I'm going to start, and Michael is going to supplement with some market specifics. I mean, again, when we look at the general economics, professional and business services, for example, still has positive job growth. And that's an area where we do have a lot of our residents employed.  Finance and insurance kind of flat, information service is certainly down but not down that dramatically, and the unemployment rate remains very low, especially for the college educated. So I guess, I just want to point out again on the macro. The macro picture is very good for our company and for the markets we sit in, not just in the long term, but in the near term in the here and now. So certainly, there can be another shoe that drops, but the current numbers we're all seeing are certainly declined from the COVID recovery numbers, but they're still pretty good, and people losing jobs are finding them. And that's been the experience that looks to me like in the general economy. And I'll let Michael comment on what he's seeing in the rest of our portfolio. Yes. Again, it's Mark, Nick to start, and Michael may have something to add here. But I'll start by talking about the employment base of our residents as we see it in the market. So we looked at sort of the big tech majors, and we said what percent of our residents have stated that they're employed by those big companies in Los Angeles, and that's something on the order of 3%. So I think we just have very low exposure to those sort of tech folks in the very diversified L.A. economy. So I think L.A. just, frankly, is stronger than San Francisco Bay Area and stronger than Seattle right now where we have higher numbers of our residents employed by those sorts of people and probably bigger local economic impacts. So I think we're, in your opinion -- it's almost like we have 2 empty buildings in Los Angeles, we're delivering into same-store over the rest of this year and that we're going to fill up, and we've got the demand for it. So I think when you look at the local economy, that matches up very well with our portfolio. They're in content creation. They're in other businesses, some of which feel some pressure. But this disproportionate tech layoff, that isn't a Los Angeles phenomenon that's occurring to all over the country. In the extent there's any concentration, it's more San Francisco and Seattle than it is L.A. Yes, but the supply is being met by people that have jobs. That was the point of my comment. It isn't -- a lot of these people are in diversified industries. So it isn't like everyone is losing their job down in Los Angeles. There's -- it's very well employed down there. A lot of people looking for housing, a lot of demand, Michael sees good demand numbers in terms of applications and the like. So that's the source of our confidence, a diversified economy in which -- like I said, us and others are effectively delivering empty buildings into that, but I'm confident that demand will need it given what we see on the ground and given the composition of employment in the market. Yes. I've got some numbers for you. I don't have the East Coast, but the Bay Area is about 14%. And Seattle is about 30%. And I'll start. Bob will help here a little. The data transformation project is something we're working on. We mentioned this before in prior calls. It's a big data analytics project with an outside vendor. You can expect a couple of million dollars more there and then it should be at an end.  All of our internal employee hires and all that, that's in our normal overhead load. So continuing costs are in the run rate of the business. The sort of discrete onetime sort of events are separately categorized, as we said on the Page 24 of the release. And I don't know, Bob, if you want to comment on the risk. No, this all falls, it's Mark, below our deductible handouts. So this is all covered by us. It's Mark. It's a good question. The insurance market typically has, as you suggested, when you see costs go up as much as this capacity has gone up. We don't yet see that. And the difference now is that fixed income is a real alternative. I mean folks that are reinsurers can invest in a lot of different things. And the fixed income market and maybe even these beaten down equity values may be more interesting to them. So there's a little more competition for those reinsurance dollars that investment. So in the off-season here because we just renewed our policy program -- our property program last month, Alex, we're going to be out there looking for other capacity in other places because I'm not sure given the severity of this named windstorm risk that we're going to be able to find additional capacity for that risk. Now EQR doesn't have Florida exposure, and we don't have that risk, but it has impacted other spots in the market. And other folks have much larger increases than we had. Ours was about 20% on our property program. So I would say I would expect normally for the market to get bigger, I wonder this time how quickly that's going to occur, given concerns that these sort of wind storms, especially are going to be more continuous than they've been in the past and just alternatives that insurers have and reinsurers have to invest elsewhere. So hopefully, that's helpful. Yes, a great question. We certainly like not to repeat things like that. You got to look at the IRR in the deal. You start with these elevated cash flows, you're getting a little bit better cap rate because of the fact that later on, you're going to be paying these higher taxes. So for us in year 8 or 9, taxes are going to go up and you're going to really have this flatten out. But it's not the order of magnitude of the 421a program. So -- and we also keep track, Alex, of these. So we're not allowing any 1 year to be overburdened. So we don't feel like we're robbing Peter to pay Paul as long as we're comfortable with our IRR. So as our overall IRR, we being paid upfront, for the cash flow growth flatness that will occur 8, 9, 10 years from now. And I think we feel like we were, and we'll do deals like that.  And most of the new product is going to have stuff like this. So we'll also buy some stuff that's a little bit older. Alex and his team are looking at those kind of deals as well where you won't have that but if you have an older deal, remember, you're going to be putting in a lot more capital. So it's not possible to avoid some sort of cost here because if we bought something 10 years old that had fully stabilized taxes in Atlanta, it probably would require more capital, and that would affect the IRR. So we're going to look at the IRR and use that as our check on that. So first off, there isn't such a significant opportunity out there that it's worth using our precious leverage capacity or issuing a bunch of equity below what we think the intrinsic worth of the business is. So I haven't been presented yet with that issue. Talking to the Board, we're certainly willing to take leverage up. We have a stated leverage policy, Bob? Yes. And we're approaching 3x so into the 3x. So I would say to you that there are several billion dollars of capacity in the system to buy great assets at great prices using debt when and if we see those opportunities, and we're looking hard for those. We don't see them yet. But I'd start with debt. But certainly, the JV market is another source of capital. We're very aware of that. The private market continues to love the apartment industry, even if the public markets are being buffeted a little bit by some of these cross wins. So we're out there looking for other sources of capital for sure. Just to make sure I understand the question. When do we think supply will start going down based on deliveries? I'm sorry, didn't near the end of that. I think you've got the stuff it's going to get completed. I would say you're looking more in like '25 and '26. I mean stuff you start now -- I mean, if you've got your capital stack and you're able to start, you're going to deliver. I mean, you may deliver a quarter late because of the supply chain, but you're going to deliver. So I think the starts Alex referred to, will impact '25's count will be lower and '26's count will be lower but stuff for this year and next, that's expected to deliver will deliver. And I think some of the numbers in some of the markets, some of which we're interested in, like Denver and Austin are really large.  And that's a terrific opportunity for us to buy. And to sell some of these assets where we're overallocated in some of the coastal markets. And I think that's going to be an attractive play for us. Yes, it's Mark. I'll take that. So being in a consumer-facing business, there's always some level of litigation costs. They're widely varying. There's no significant amount of RealPage related costs in there, but they are in there, but it's relatively small. The reason for that is that the case is at its early stages. And you should think about that going on for a longer period of time.  They aren't resolved in weeks or months. It's more like years. But again, we feel very strongly about our position. We think these claims are without merit, and we're going to defend ourselves, and we continue to feel really confident in our prospects there. So there is some small amount, but it's small. Most of that just relates to just continuing legal costs from being in a customer-facing business in an industry that has regulation. There's no riskless apartment market, and it's Mark. I'll start, and Alex may supplement it. I mean, if you're buying in some markets, you're going to have higher insurance costs, but maybe lower political risk.  And then another market, you may have slightly higher political risk and a lot better resilience and maybe a better supply picture. Our whole investment thought process of being diversified is premised on the idea of kind of accepting these risks in small doses across the whole country and staying tied to these affluent renters so it doesn't change our mind.  We just underwrite it and the deals will either work or they won't. I do think that some of the markets that have outperformed lately in the Sunbelt that have resilience challenges are really going to be pressed by these insurance costs. And frankly, maybe even the availability of financing if insurance is unavailable at some of the issue lenders are very sensitive to. But from our point of view, I mean, we're just going to run the numbers. I think these markets continue to have other subjective factors that are valuable to us. And I think they're going to remain investable the ones that we're interested in, for sure. Well, I'm going to split it up because there's the urban conversion of these office buildings that are really giant 1-block floor plates. It's very challenging in urban locations to take a property on LaSalle Street in Chicago or in Midtown Manhattan, it spans a block and doesn't have a lot of windows relative to the total floor space, doesn't have a lot of plumbing fixtures. There's been work done by engineering firms in Boston, for example, on this. And there's relatively few of these buildings -- these large buildings that are going to work as repositioning plays. They may work if the building isn't there anymore, but they're just taking that building and some of our reengineering it is going to be tough. In the suburbs, you may -- and this has been common in the Bay Area and in suburban Washington. You may scrape an office park and build apartments there. And we've been involved in those sort of plays, but those are different altogether because you're not reusing the building. So I think reusing an office building is tough in an urban situation just because of the need for plumbing fixtures in the unit and the need for windows that these larger office buildings just don't allow very well. But I would say, as urban owners, we'd like to see the central business district -- office districts thrive. I mean they pay taxes that support transit, that support public safety, we want those to be repositioned.  It will just take more time and likely be more costly and extensive than some observers seem to think. I just don't think you can snap your finger and take a 4-year-old office building and turn it into a livable awesome apartment building in the center of whether it's Manhattan or the center of Los Angeles. So we'll kind of play wait-and-see on that, but urban repositionings for us are not likely in place. All right. Well, thank you all for your time on the call today and for your interest in Equity Residential. Good day."

            "name": "Robert Garechana",
            "content": "Eric, it's Bob. I would say that the drop-off is more ratable through the year because what's going on in the 2023 kind of guidance is really more about what's happened in 2022, than the kind of core trajectory of the business. So we continue to expect kind of that sequential leasing component, but you start getting into -- starting in Q2 and really into Q3. Difficult comp periods from 2022. And so you'll see Q1 as the high point and then a pretty consistent but above trend quarter-over-quarter rate of growth as you go through the back end of the year. Yes, I would say that not a lot of chatter yet because we're really just focused on 2023. And to your point, John, 2023 is actually better than what we anticipated.  Obviously, we have that Anchor with prop 13 in California, which is helpful. As you move beyond, you always deal with that issue of revenue gaps and budgetary gaps and where people are going to get money out of what pocket. So far, we feel good about where we are, very good about where we are in 2023. And it's too early to tell -- but with these municipalities, what they'll do in 2024, what those revenue gaps will look like and where -- what pockets they'll come to get it. So, so far, I'd say too early to tell for '24. Yes. And Steve, on the bad debt side, just to fill out the question, we are -- we certainly did better in the first quarter. We expected the first quarter to sequentially be equivalent, excluding governmental rental assistance to the fourth quarter, and we're a couple of million dollars better. And that equates to a little bit under 10 basis points on a full year basis for revenue. That trajectory is continuing into April, so it's still early. And so we would expect to perform better overall. But keep in mind, the 90 basis points assume that we're having improvement. So it's just how much that improvement is better relative to what we embedded in guidance, but we do think there's potential upside there. To the extent we continue to see that same pace as we play out through April into May and the rest of the year. Yes, certainly. To the extent that all of those historical balances that Michael just described have been written off. So to the extent that you collect them, you would see that as a current period pickup offsetting bad debt. So those collections would flow through. But as Michael mentioned, we would expect that. We don't -- haven't really incorporated much of that overall that we'd expect that to really trail. Yes. So -- the government -- you're right, the governmental rental relief in '22 was $32 million. You would have to get back to, call it, 40, 50 basis points normal, that's $1 million a month of bad debt. If you look at kind of the disclosure for Q1, we were averaging like probably around -- certainly in January and February, more like . So it's like a $3 million spread -- so you'd have to get $3 million times the 12 months or so is about where you'd be at, which would be a little bit more than what the governmental rental relief would be. But you're getting there if you got back to, call it, that $1 million a month right away. That's obviously not what's happening yet. We're hopeful that, that happens and the sooner the better from a growth perspective. Does that help, Rich? Yes. So that would probably be -- the 1.7% would probably be something, call it, 20 basis points better, maybe a little bit more, maybe 30. Yes. The other components are adjustments to various kind of regular course litigation reserves that we made during the quarter as we got more information and adjusted our outlook. So those are all case-by-case dependent and depend on facts and circumstances at the moment. By 5 to 6x net debt to EBITDA. Yes. Thanks, Adam. It's Bob. Our expectation is that there won't be anything material going forward into Q2 related to these specific storms. Obviously, if there's a different event, then we don't know. But as it relates to this, there's nothing material that's moving the numbers soon for Q2. Yes. Josh, it's Bob. Our expectation is that, that could be pretty bumpy because -- if you think about the expense, the expense is really in advance, oftentimes is in advance of the actual move-out. So it depends on how quickly and how fast the cases get filed, which we've made a good amount of progress faster than what we thought in the first quarter.  We'll have some go into the second quarter. That line item is normally a line item that barely grows for us. And so it will be bumpy because of this elevated activity, but it will be lumpy. So just expect it to be kind of grow above trend relative to history and be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, hopefully tailing off as we get to the back end of the year."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Alexander Brackenridge",
            "content": "Steve, this is Alex. Well, first of all, transaction volume is down pretty dramatically. So the closings will be down about 60-plus percent across the country. And that's pretty evenly spread among the different markets. So a lot less activity, but the sellers that do act now understand that cap rates are somewhere between 5% and 5.25%. So they're eager to transact. And that comes from really 3 different types of sellers. There's the private REITs that have the redemption request that they have to fulfill.  So we're seeing some activity from them. The merchant builders aren't really capitalized to own property in the long run. They always expect it to be able to execute and get out of the deal. So a little bit of that. And gives some floating rate borrowers who have caps that are expiring that they are not able to cover. So there are sources of opportunity, but it's really been slow so far. But I would expect all 3 of those areas are more likely to pick up than not in the next 6 months.  So we are excited to deploy more capital as those opportunities arise. And as you mentioned in the past, we've taken advantage of dislocation in the market. So we're certainly set up to that. But in the meantime, we're trading in and out of properties, so selling -- dispose opportunistically and taking advantage of acquisitions that we see. In terms of starts, I mean, they're dramatically down. Already this year, what we were thinking in our markets would be, say, 110,000 starts is now looking like it might be half of that today, and I expect even more things that we thought might start will drop off the list through the rest of the year. It's really hard to make a development work in an environment where cap rates are, as I said, 5% to 5.25%, you need a yield at least around a 6%. And you just can't get there with costs that may not be rising as high as quickly as they used to a year or so ago, but they're still going up, and obviously, financing costs are higher. So it's just really hard to make a development underwrite. So we expect to see more and more deals drop out, development deals. Well, clearly, it has an impact. It's a big move in the rate from 1.5% to 5.5% in L.A. And it was designed to raise cap the [indiscernible] money for cities to build affordable housing. I think it probably had the reverse effect and that there won't be that many transactions, so they're not going to collect very much. So it may be that this gets reduced over time. So we don't know that it will be around forever because it doesn't seem to be well thought out public policy. But in the meantime, there are other ways -- other properties that aren't subject to the tax within California that we can transact on. And we can also consider joint ventures as an opportunity to lower exposure in a market like L.A., where selling a property may not make a lot of sense. Michael, this is Alex. The 5.7% really isn't a reflection of market. It's more a reflection of the property being in lease-up right now. So we're taking it over the middle of a lease-up and we're going to finish it off. So we're getting compensated for doing that. So I would say, as I said earlier on the call, the rates are somewhere between 5% and 5.25% for a typical deal. And so yes, we're getting a little bit of a boost there because we're taking on a little bit of a lease-up, but that's not an indication of market. And then in terms of other opportunities, I mean, we're obviously always looking for other opportunities, and it has been pretty slow though so far. And in some cases, Alex, this is Alex. As the abatement burns off or when it burns off, some of the units might go to market. So you got to pick up there, too. So it's not all downside. Generally, there -- this is Alex. Generally, they're looking for the same kind of return, a cap rate of, say, 5%, 5.25%, depending on the assets that we would see in the transactions market. It's really -- as you said -- Tayo, this is Alex, about matching the sales and the acquisition. So we keep track of that. We don't get ahead of ourselves on either side and just match them up and it's a neutral bet, but we feel like we're accomplishing our goal of diversifying the footprint. Quiet primarily, but also in the sub of our established markets. And as we've talked about, being opportunistic, there may be opportunities that come up. There's more dislocation that are appealing anywhere and we would chase those. And in New York, downtown where it was done a lot. That was on the back of a tax abatement that since expired. The 421g was specifically to promote the conversion. So it doesn't happen easily and it does need -- it generally does need public policy support."

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.\nMarty McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2024 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer.

Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2024 results and outlook for the year. I will start us off, then Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, will discuss our recent acquisition of Blackstone and the overall transaction market. And then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will speak to our operating performance, then we'll go ahead and take your questions. We posted solid performance in the third quarter, driven by continued good demand and little competitive new supply in our established markets, which constitute 90% of our portfolio. Big picture, we continue to see a stable environment and a healthy consumer. Unemployment is low and wage growth is steady, both of which bodes well for our customers. In a moment, Michael will speak to the various puts and takes we saw in our operations during the quarter. As is usually the case, we saw some items like occupancy and retention exceed our expectations, while others like blended rate came in lower in terms of our expectations. As you can see on Page 5 of the management presentation that we posted to our website last night, this type of variability in pricing is not uncommon. In fact, pricing so far in the fourth quarter has normalized consistent with seasonal patterns and with our expectations. In sum, we remain on track with our same-store revenue guidance, and we expect to end the year in a good position for 2025. On the expense side, the machine continues to churn out to terrific results with same-store expense growth of 3.2% for the quarter and our expectation for full year same-store expense growth of 3%. I want to thank the team across our organization for their continuing focus on innovation, cost control and our customer. Turning to 2025, while there remains a considerable amount of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, that could impact our business and the economy generally, we like our setup. We are too early to give 2025 guidance at this point, but we have given you some insight into our preliminary thinking on some of the inputs for 2025 same-store revenue on Pages 7 through 9 of the management presentation. In sum, we think 2025 should produce solid same-store revenue results for Equity Residential. We see steady demand from a well-employed affluent renter base, a favorable supply picker and the 90% of our NOI in the less supplied established markets and continuing cost and lifestyle preferences favoring rental housing. In terms of our expansion markets, we expect that a recovery in same-store revenue will not occur until 2026, given continuing high supply levels, but we do hope to see some improvement in currently highly negative new lease rates and to see lower concessions during next year's leasing season. Now switching over to capital allocation. We accelerated our acquisitions of newer, well-located assets in our expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Denver in the third quarter. We are excited to acquire these properties at a basis that we see as highly favorable and add properties with strong cash flow growth prospects as supply levels declined substantially over the next few years. The entire equity team also looks forward to demonstrating our core competencies of smartly acquiring and efficiently integrating new acquisitions. We now have approximately 10% of our net operating income in our expansion markets assuming stabilization of our assets under development. In a moment, Alex will give you more detail on our transaction activity. We are funding our expected $1.6 billion in acquisitions this year, with a mix of fixed rate debt, dispositions and the use of commercial paper supported by our unsecured line of credit. In a moment, Alex will give you detail on the disposition activity funding these acquisitions. The one source I did want to highlight is the $600 million in fixed rate debt we raised in September. These 10-year notes were issued at a coupon of 4.65%, which is the lowest 10-year coupon issued in the REIT space since 2022, and would be hard to replicate today. So, a nice job by Bob and his team on this. Before I close, a quick note on where these acquisitions fit into our overall capital allocation strategy. Our goal remains to own an apartment portfolio that has the highest long-term total return in the sector with a focus on cash flow growth and taking into account risk and with the least amount of volatility possible. We intend to achieve this goal by catering to well-earning renters in the 12 or so metro areas that we think have the most desirable lifestyles for this demographic and present the best balance of long-term supply, demand, regulatory and resiliency opportunities and risks and where we can efficiently operate our properties with our industry-leading people and systems. As the last few years have shown, there is no riskless apartment market. The volatility and negative rental growth we see in the expansion markets and the strong results we are seeing in our Northeastern markets, many of which were recently left for dead by investors, reinforces our commitment to our strategy of better balancing our portfolio between coastal markets and select sunbelt markets as well as urban and suburban locations. We expect the benefits of this balanced strategy to play out in 2025. Seattle and San Francisco, particularly our uniquely urban portfolios in those markets should generate better same-store revenue results, which, along with the continued strength in the Northeast, and the favorable 2025 supply picture across almost all of our established markets should more than offset continued supply-driven weakness in our expansion markets. In later years, the supply wanes in our expansion markets, those markets will be more of a same-store revenue growth engine for our company. We are confident this balanced geographical strategy, coupled with our efficient operating platform will create value over the long term for our investors, and are eager to demonstrate this over the next several years. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Alex Brackenridge.\nAlex Brackenridge: Thank you, Mark. As we discussed on our call in January, we came to 2024 committed to continuing to reposition our portfolio by increasing our presence in our expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. For the first half of the year, the market remained frozen and we made no progress. However, in the third quarter, as interest rates dropped and the possibility of a soft landing for the economy became more evident, market opened up and we significantly stepped up our activity, closing on 14 assets with over 4,400 units and a total price of $1.26 billion. Those acquisitions were funded by a combination of the proceeds from the $600 million bond issuance that Mark mentioned, $365 million in dispositions and $295 million of commercial paper. The dispositions consisted of six assets located in San Francisco, Washington D.C. and Boston that averaged 43 years old and sold for a 5.7% disposition yield. All of the assets were noncore holdings that had a combination of significant CapEx needs in a variety of operating challenges. The acquisitions meanwhile averaged just seven years old, have limited retail and are all 100% market rate. 11 came from an off-market portfolio from Blackstone that was tailored to fit our expansion strategy in terms of asset quality and locations. Recognizing our ability to provide speed and certainty of execution, Blackstone chose to deal directly with us rather than execute the typical auction process. The other three acquisitions were one-offs purchased for merchant building. After end of the quarter, we closed on an additional asset in Atlanta for $89.5 million. The weighted average cap rate on all this activity was 5% and is anticipated to generate an 8% unleveraged IRR. These transactions appeal to us because they allowed us to expand our presence in markets with strong job growth, increasing numbers of affluent renters and relatively low regulatory risk at an attractive basis that is approximately 15% below estimated replacement cost. Admittedly, these markets are also seeing outsized supply relative to our coastal markets. Accordingly, our underwriting reflects competitive leasing environments for the first two years of our ownership with rental income down or flat depending on the amount of approximate deliveries. We expect that some of that back to NOI will be offset by running these assets more efficiently on the revenue and expense side as we integrate them into our superior operating platform. We anticipate having further opportunities to purchase assets in these markets as the supply pipeline is up in 2026 and more robust rent growth will be on the horizon. But at that time, pricing will likely be at lower cap rates and at a less attractive price relative to replacement costs. As we head into the end of the year and plan for 2025, we expect to continue to see attractive acquisition opportunities at around five cap rates in Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. And with a cost of capital advantage and the ability to complete due diligence quickly relative to leverage buyers expect to close on a sizable share of transaction activity. We currently have an asset in Denver and one in Atlanta, totaling approximately $190 million under contract to close before the end of the year at around a five cap. Austin, our fourth expansion market, where we have only three assets remains challenged with a historic amount of deliveries that is resulting in a highly competitive rental market leading us to stay on the sidelines given hard it is to assess when things will stabilize. With our recent closings and assuming stabilization of development deals in progress, as Mark noted in his comments, we now have approximately 10% of our portfolio in our expansion markets, towards a goal of 20% to 25% that if the transaction market remains favorable, we expect to achieve over the next 18 to 24 months. We are excited to add exposure to these high job growth markets that will see declining supply over the next two to three years. What should not be forgotten, however, is that the reduction in supply is even more dramatic in our coastal markets, where starts are down nearly 60% in 2024 after being down over 30% in 2023. With 2025 starts projected to be down again, we anticipate one of the best supply-demand balances in our coastal markets that we have seen in a very long time. Our expansion market exposure, combined with our coastal market presence, positions us to generate optimal risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders, catering to a customer with a resilient and growing income while balancing out supply, regulatory and resiliency challenges. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Alex. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our third quarter 2024 operating performance, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year and what the setup for 2025 could look like. As Mark mentioned, fundamentals in our business remain solid. During the third quarter, our focus on serving our customers and our corresponding strong renewal process led to the lowest reported third quarter resident turnover in our history, and strong physical occupancy of 96.1%. Move-outs to buy homes remained extraordinarily low and renewal rate achieved was strong across most markets. Blended rate, however, ended up at the low end of our expectations for the quarter, primarily from lower-than-expected new lease change driven by the City of Los Angeles and continued pressure in our expansion markets. In these markets, the pressure from excess inventory from both eviction-related, existing and new supply, has led us to prioritize occupancy to maximize revenue, which came at the expense of some rate growth during the quarter. It is also important to remember that it is often not uncommon to see variability in new lease change over relatively short periods of time. For example, while we saw a steeper and earlier decline than usual and new lease change in the third quarter, we have seen a better picture so far in the fourth quarter for this volatile statistic. Looking at the remainder of the year, our strategy of maximizing revenue by maintaining higher occupancy heading into the quieter months of the year should drive performance along with positive contributions from other income and bad debt net. We still anticipate normal seasonal rent deceleration which will result in negative new lease change in the fourth quarter. But at this point, we are seeing very stable renewal rate achieved results. And of note, Seattle and San Francisco have both a relatively easier pricing comp in the fourth quarter and have shown good early signs of improvement, including maintaining strong occupancy and reducing concession usage. Sitting here today, our net effective rents at the portfolio level are close to 2% above prior year, which is also a solid position to be in. Now let me give you some color on the market starting with East Coast. The Boston market is one of our best performers in 2024. Both our urban and suburban portfolios are performing well, but consistent with our expectations, the urban portfolio produced stronger results in the third quarter. We like our positioning here as our urban-centric portfolio will see very little competitive new supply for the remainder of 2024 and the full year of 2025. Moving on to New York, demand feels good as we are more than 97% occupied. And as we have said on past calls, with a solid job market and very little competitive new supply, we think this market will continue to produce good revenue growth, and we'll have some of the best supply-demand dynamics in the country for the next couple of years. Rounding out the East Coast, Washington, D.C. continues to be the rock star of 2024. The market is over 96.5% occupied and is producing some of the top rental rate growth in our portfolio. Demand feels good across all of our submarkets and is expected to continue but we do expect some pressure from deliveries in the fourth quarter, particularly in the central D.C. submarket. On the West Coast, as I mentioned, Los Angeles showed some weakness in blended rate growth, particularly in the new lease change. We think there are a few factors in play here. First, our overall pricing power here was clearly impacted by less job growth than anticipated, especially office using jobs and a bit of a pause from the L.A. studios in the content production. Second, on supply, we are seeing some competitive new supply, particularly in the downtown, Koreatown and West L.A. submarkets, as well as some excess supply coming online due to continued improvements in the eviction process, which is now taking about four months, down from six months earlier in the year. Finally, the city is still working through some quality of life issues in the urban submarkets like Koreatown and Downtown L.A. Our suburban portfolios, primarily driven by Santa Clarita and Ventura County, are performing better than our urban submarkets. The good news is that we are seeing some positive momentum across the entire Los Angeles market right now. And with our rents on top of last year, a condition we have not seen all year long, puts us in a favorable position. In addition, today\u2019s occupancy is running 40 basis points above both the prior year and is trending positively versus the third quarter. We are also experiencing some of the highest retention rates of the year in Los Angeles. And while job growth has been somewhat muted in 2024, projections for Moody Analytics are much more positive for growth in Los Angeles in 2025, particularly office-using jobs. Assuming that comes to pass, then along with the modest new apartment deliveries in most places across this vast geography, we think we should drive a reacceleration of results in 2025. In the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County, we continue to see demand but evidence of some price sensitivity with residents willing to move further out in these markets for affordability reasons. After showing some of the best growth in the portfolio over the last few years, we are likely returning to more normal long-term growth rates. Rounding out the West Coast, San Francisco and Seattle continue to perform better than our original modest expectations. At this point, we feel good about the pace of recovery in these two markets and they are set up to contribute to growth in 2025, and we have included a page in the management presentation that highlights some of the favorable trends we are already seeing in these markets. In San Francisco, demand feels good with occupancy of 96.2%, which is 90 basis points higher than last year. Rents are following normal seasonal patterns, but we are seeing slower deceleration compared to last year and renewals are performing well. In addition, some impactful return to office policy from firms like Salesforce, are helping to drive significant improvements to street activation. Having just spent a week in the market, you can really feel the energy and a reminder of why this market is the center of the tech universe, including the rapidly growing AI sector. On the supply side, there is very little new supply coming to the market. Overall starts are way down, and there have been almost no new competitive starts for the last year, which supports improving conditions for the next couple of years. We are optimistic about this market and its ability to drive our results in 2025. In Seattle, the recovery feels similar to San Francisco but further along. During the third quarter, same-store revenue reflected improvement driven by low turnover, strong occupancy and better-than-expected renewal rate achieved. New lease change, while still more negative than we would like is better than last year, and we would expect this metric to improve over time. As we sit here today, demand drivers are better than we thought. Our occupancy is over 96% and our renewal performance remains strong. And looking at our migration patterns, we are also seeing more people come to us from further out suburbs, which is an additional demand driver for our assets. The big recent story here is the five-day week return-to-office announcement from Amazon, which is the 800-pound gorilla in the market. For the past several weeks, our local team have reported increased interest from Amazon folks who are living further away from the office and looking for apartment homes in the downtown and South Lake Union submarkets. With focus from city government and the local business community, along with increased business and tourist foot traffic, livability in the downtown just keeps getting better. Another reason positive is that the tech employment in the market looks solid as we see more postings for physicians in both the city of Seattle and Bellevue, Redmond's area. As previously discussed, there is supply coming in the fourth quarter, and we will need to see how the demand and pricing holds. But at present, it should finish the year strong and like San Francisco, we have some real optimism on this market and what it can contribute in 2025. Switching to the expansion markets. The volume of competitive new supply continues to impact both occupancy and rate. Denver is our best performer of the expansion markets and our relatively small same-store portfolios in the other expansion markets, Dallas is producing the best revenue results in Atlanta where we have the most direct exposure to new supply right now is the worst. We continue to see demand, but it is a challenging operating environment for both new lease and retention given the amount of new supply. Similar to last quarter, the pressure on new leases makes renewing residents and maintaining occupancy, the number one priority for these markets. As you know, we added a number of new suburban assets to our portfolio in Atlanta, Dallas and Denver during the quarter that will have a while before they are in our same-store reported results. Overall, we are excited to grow our portfolio and create operating scale in these markets. While these markets have near-term supply risk, they continue to demonstrate long-term demand from our target renter demographic and provide a nice balance to our core portfolio. On the innovation front, we are very pleased with the initial results of our new AI resident inquiry application, which was able to handle almost 60% of our inquiries in our test market. We have a lot of confidence that as this application keeps learning we will get to 75% to 80% coverage, which will create an additional layer of operating efficiencies in the company. Looking ahead, now that we have centralized the support of many parts of our customer journey, we are looking forward to improving and optimizing those processes, including the upcoming efforts to streamline the leasing process to make it faster and easier for our renters. Before I discuss the 2025 building blocks, I would like to highlight our expense performance in the quarter. Continued favorable results on property taxes, low increases on repairs and maintenance and utilities and an actual decrease in on-site payroll drove the quarterly results and should get us to our expected 3% midpoint for the year. We are very proud of our 10-year same-store expense compounded annual growth rate of 3.2% and consider cost control and innovation implementation as core to our DNA at EQR. In closing, as Mark mentioned, while it's still too early to give 2025 guidance on Page 7 in the management presentation that we have published last night, we gave some building blocks for next year's revenue performance. Overall, the setup for 2025 feels solid. Today, we expect that we will start the year with embedded growth near 1% and in a very well-occupied position. We also have a very favorable setup as the expected deliveries of competitive new supply in our established markets will be lower again. And while the expansion markets still have significant supply expected, the absolute quantity is beginning to come down. On top of all of that, we like our ability to attract and retain new residents. In particular, we are most excited about the potential we see from our focus on the customer and our ability to maintain occupancy along with the upside we see from our West Coast markets of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, which make up 42% of the company's NOI. Those factors, coupled with the continued performance in our East Coast markets should deliver solid revenue results for the company in 2025. I want to thank our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation, enhancing customer service and their exceptional disciplined approach to expense management. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Eric Wolfe with Citi.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned in your presentation the potential for bad debt and other income to add to revenue growth next year. I know it's still early, but could you just give us a sense for what you're thinking about that potential? For other income, I would assume it's mainly tied to the WiFi program. So we think there's some good visibility there, but correct me I'm wrong.\nBob Garechana: Yes. Eric, it's Bob. I'll start, and Michael might augment on some of the other income stuff. But starting with bad debt, we continue to expect to end 2024 around, call it, 1% or maybe slightly better than that of a percentage of revenue. So bad debt as a percentage of revenue. If normal is \u2013 normal, meaning pre-pandemic is around 50 basis points. The opportunity set is delta between there, right. We'll have to see what the progress looks like. We'll have to see what the court system looks like as to whether or not we get all the way there, but to kind of frame a construct of what the opportunity set or contributions incremental growth is, is somewhere between that 1% and back to normalcy. We'll give you more color as we get to the fourth quarter guidance as to what's embedded in our numbers overall. On the other income side, you're correct that a lot of it is \u2013 and we mentioned this, this will be a contributor to fourth quarter performance as well. But a lot of our initiatives were back-end loaded, in terms of their implementation, particularly the bulk WiFi and the adoption of the bulk WiFi. So that will start contributing in a more \u2013 it already has started in the third quarter, but will be more meaningful in the fourth quarter and will continue to contribute as you get into $25 million. With that will come a little bit of expense component, which I think you're familiar with in the industry when you implement this, but there should be good contribution that will be potential for being greater than what you saw in 2024 because of the timing of those rollouts.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. That's helpful. And then you also talked about seeing more Sunbelt opportunities. I think you said low 5% cap rate range. We've seen a lot of volatility in the 10-year dropping below as I think it's 3.5%, now back up at 4.3%. I mean as it sort of oscillates back and forth, does that change your pricing that you're willing to transact at all? Or are you just less sort of focused on your short-term cost of capital?\nAlex Brackenridge: Hey Eric, it's Alex. Rates have moved so quickly. It's a little hard to assess that. But I will tell you that as of recently as last week, there were opportunities pricing at like 4.75-ish in markets like Denver and Dallas. So there's a lot of capital, a lot of people interested in apartments. Now we're at a 10 year, it's 4.3 something, maybe that changes a little bit. The reality is with the uncertainty about rates plus the election coming up, there isn't that much product on the market right now. I think this will be a feeling out process for everyone, as we see where things end up, but there's still all this capital. I think overall, the 5% cap rate feels pretty good to me looking forward.\nEric Wolfe: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Hi, good morning. I guess, given the projections that you guys have for fourth quarter on blended leasing spreads, that's going to sort of bring the figure in somewhere just under 2% for the year, and that's down about 100 basis points from the 2023 number. So as we kind of think out into next year, I know supply is coming down, but it's still relatively heavy, and you still have deliveries that are kind of working through the back half of this year that haven't been fully absorbed. So I'm just curious, is it your expectation that leasing spreads could actually hold next year? Or do you think with slowing economy, slowing job growth. And still some heavy deliveries that leasing spreads likely moderate again next year?\nMichael Manelis: Hey Steve, this is Michael. Maybe I'll just start and just say. So first, we're just \u2013 we're in the very early stages of our kind of budget process that we're putting in all those factors that you just described. In terms of the leasing spreads and how to think about this, I revert back to kind of this Page 5 in the management presentation that really talks more about just the pricing trend and what's happening with absolute market rent growth, kind of on a year-over-year basis because that's really going to be the catalyst that's going to drive a lot of that. Right now, a lot of the factors for the setup for 2025 feel very similar as we were heading into 2024 and how we talked about it. But I still think it's a little bit too early for me to kind of give you the guidance on where we think intra-period like market rent is going to grow. But I don't \u2013 I mean we have a lot of things that are set up to be catalyst for us, but we also know we still got to work through some of the absorption of supply in some of these markets. So I think we'll just see kind of how this plays out for the next couple of quarters.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then maybe on the expense side, kind of following up on Eric's question about the WiFi. I know you get the benefits of revenue, but there's also a cost associated with that. You guys have done a very good job keeping expenses down around the 3% level. Is that growth rate achievable next year, you think, with kind of these added expenses? Or is it likely that we see a little bit of pressure on the expense side just due to the pickup in other income revenue growth?\nMark Parrell: Hey Steve, it's Mark. You may see a little pressure above that 3%. We talked about on the last call, we've got still pressure from the 421-a burn-off of the tax abatement in New York. So it will be a little there. Certainly, the inflation numbers this morning were a little discouraging. So there may just continue to be some cost pressure. But whatever that number is, we'll be at the low end of it. And I think we'll quantify it for you, so you know exactly what the WiFi impact is. And of course, there's an offsetting much more significant revenue benefit. But I guess, it wouldn't surprise me if the number was a little bit higher than the number we're going to put up this year. But we're still rolling numbers up.\nSteve Sakwa: All right, thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning, guys. So first question, I guess, was just on the portfolio performance during the quarter. Maybe you could kind of walk us through how that evolves over the course of the third quarter. It seemed like there was a bit of a drop there in December in new lease rates. And maybe as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, I think new lease rates are expected to fall to about negative 4% from the minus 1% in the third quarter. So I'm looking for some color on kind of where you see perhaps the incremental drag? I'm pretty sort of San Francisco and Seattle pretty easy comps given last year's performance.\nMichael Manelis: Yes, good morning, Haendel, this is Michael. So I think what I would start and just say is let's just back up and think about the third quarter. So what we saw in the third quarter and it was really the later part of the third quarter is, we've had an occupancy kind of bias. We've been leaning into that. And specific to really the city of Los Angeles and the expansion markets, we did drop some of the rates, we increased some of the concession usage. And you can kind of see that on Page 5 in that pricing trend where you just didn't have as much robust kind of pricing power near the tail end of the quarter. And that translated right into that new lease change for us for the number. Where we sit here now in October, right, we've got a setup where you do \u2013 like you said, we have a little bit of an easier comp coming at us in Seattle and San Francisco. I've got a market like Los Angeles, right now have rents on top of prior year, and that's a condition we haven't seen all year long. So now you look at the October stats and you feel like you're pretty well positioned, but I've said before, right, these metrics are best viewed over a longer period of time versus kind of any stand-alone month, especially kind of given the quantities. And like specific to the fourth quarter and like our assumptions for that blended rate growth between 75 and 125 basis point growth. We have fairly stable achieved renewal rate increases kind of expected, and we are allowing for some continued moderation of new lease change. But the setup right now in the first month, we still got two-thirds of the quarter to get through feels pretty good to us.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And Haendel, it's Mark. Just to add to that a little bit. This is a give-and-take type process. I mean, we can get new lease rate to be a higher number by letting occupancy decline, and that may not benefit same-store revenue growth, which is our ultimate goal. So we're trying to make as much money as we can in the current quarter and have a nice setup for the next year. But just viewing one factor either in one month or in \u2013 without context to the other ideas. If we were hurting on blended rate and hurting on occupancy. That would be a much more serious situation for us than what happened in September, which thus was just a blip around the average.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Thanks for the color. And then one on the Blackstone transaction. It looks like you guys used a bit more debt proportionately to fund that, I'm assuming capitalizing on lower debt costs, as you highlighted the unsecured issuance, but also the opportunity in your underlevered balance sheet. So maybe can you talk about the appetite for using a bit more leverage to fund acquisitions in the near-term? And then maybe some color on the IRR that you underwrote the Blackstone portfolio for? Thanks.\nBob Garechana: Yes. So I'll start with the balance sheet, and then I'll pass it over to Alex to talk about the IRR. But we have an incredible, as you pointed out, incredibly underlevered and strong balance sheet. As you may recall, and as those on the call may recall, we have spent a long time frankly, warehousing capital looking for opportunities. And we warehouse capital by paying down debt and going well below our own targeted kind of debt metrics of net debt to EBITDA of 5 to 6 times. And so when the opportunity presented itself on Alex side, we capitalized on that by using the debt capacity we had, and further capitalize on it by the fact that we were able to do so at a very attractive rate overall, particularly with the use of proceeds. So we think that there is a lot more capacity given where the metrics I just outlined and the fact that we're sitting at, call it, 4.6 times. And we would look to use that debt capacity to take advantage of opportunities that make good long-term sense to lock in a really good cost of capital and allow for P&L accretion over time.\nAlex Brackenridge: And Haendel, in terms of IRR, we underwrite to an unlevered IRR, and then we compare it to our weighted average cost of capital. In this case, with that unlevered IRR was about an 8%, which at that time was in excess of the WACC at that point.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you guys.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Good morning. Morning out there. Bob, maybe just sticking with the balance sheet for a minute. You guys are one of the REITs that's got an active CP program, obviously, you take advantage of the unsecured debt markets. Can you just walk us through the difference in the two programs as far as the underlying rate? And does using more CP impact your ability to \u2013 the pricing that you get on unsecured? Or how about alternating between the two programs?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So I guess, let me step back and make sure I got the question. But commercial paper for us is kind of short-term floating rate exposure that we use to deal with working capital cycles and working capital for us really means transaction volume. And so the CP program is \u2013 we'll use a portion of it. We use it in the construct of our overall capital structure to balance how much floating rate we have, et cetera, and it much cheaper than our line of credit, right? So we can borrow at, call it, SOFR plus 20 basis points and the line of credit would be contractually SOFR plus 75 or so. But we're really toggling between short-term and long-term issuance when it comes to like the unsecured market by balancing a bunch of factors, right? How much floating rate exposure, what does our liquidity profile look like? What does our maturity profile look like? What does the whole thing look like coupled together, and balancing that out? And because we've done such a great job on the balance sheet over the years and extended our duration and have a lot of capacity to have some short-term usage and some long-term components, we can use a little bit of all pockets to reduce our aggregate cost of capital, which is the goal overall.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then second question is, you guys seem to be more hopeful on Seattle and San Francisco. Over the past few years, there have been a lot of companies that have announced return to office and it's fizzled out. And obviously, we've all been collectively hoping for a rebound of Seattle and San Fran for the past few years. What gives the team on the ground confidence that this time, the return-to-office mandates and some of the positiveness that you've seen in those two markets are actually finally truly taking hold versus this could be sort of a false start that we've seen before?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Alex, this is Michael. I could start off here. So first, I just spent a week in San Francisco, and you could feel it and the on-site teams will tell you just based on the prospects that are showing up for the tours, what\u2019s driving some of that. So the migration patterns show people from further out coming back near in, when they walk into the office, they're talking about the fact that they need to be back into the office for work several days a week, and that's driving a lot of their decisions. So it's still a little bit early, I would say, in San Francisco to feel it. But when you have the big company like Salesforce making that announcement, you see the activity in the ground and the office is from the prospect. A lot of the other peripheral companies start to follow some of those bigger tech companies. And this is probably the most serious we've seen them actually talk about all of this in the marketplace. Specific to Seattle, I'll tell you, we could see it like job postings from some of the major tech providers in that market are up in the city of Seattle, job postings in Bellevue, Redmond are up. Our on-site team, we've been talking to them like every week for the past several weeks once that Amazon announcement came out. And the Amazon employees are trying to get out in front of that January start date because they're concerned that there's going to be this pent-up demand coming in, and that either the rates or the availability of certain apartments won't be there in the marketplace. So they're actually buying early from us. So we could see it right now, and Seattle just feels a little bit further along than San Francisco from that, and we feel like Amazon is really kind of serious about what they're saying to their teams.\nMark Parrell: And a little of this, Alex, it's Mark, is premised on our perspective, gleaned from the Moody's Analytics numbers for next year, that there's going to be some good job growth in the Bay Area in terms of office-using jobs. The barriers shed a lot of tech jobs and the jobs that have been added in AI have not been sufficient to offset those jobs, but we're hopeful that, that reverses itself. So I think when you talk quality of light, Seattle is definitively better. I've been there recently as well, same thing. San Francisco is better but not quite as good. I think LA is less advanced in quality of life considerations being addressed. And then you got this job overlay. And I think on the job overlay side, you feel pretty good about Seattle and you're feeling better about San Francisco and a little bit of what you saw in the third quarter for us was LA being a little sideways on jobs. So we do need that ingredient to come through for these markets to fully recover, but we feel that, we see that. Those are great industries, and I think they will attract and start to hire again if the economy keeps churning.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Hey, thanks for the time. Michael, I wanted to pick up on that conversation in Seattle. I'm just trying to help \u2013 can you just frame it with some specific metrics so we understand kind of the night and day difference. Just trying to get a sense of it's a surge of kind of foot traffic applicants or just a steady trickle post-Amazon announcement?\nMichael Manelis: Well, I mean, I think we saw these trends in migration patterns even last quarter, and we did put some good details on Page 8 in the management presentation that talk about kind of not only that urban suburban mix, but what we're actually seeing the fact that concessions are down 40% year-over-year. But I think we've seen some of these migration patterns. We've heard some of this before from our new residents moving in. And I think when you look at what the comp looks like, the comp line of our pricing trends for the fourth quarter, this time last year, we were issuing concessions, right? We had rents decelerating. And right now, while you're still seeing some normal kind of rent deceleration there, the concession use is actually kind of abating or softening a little bit in the downtown kind of submarkets. So, I think we're just seeing what we would describe as like the greenest shoots that we've seen and felt in a while.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then a question on L.A. in terms of the overhang on market vacancy and market rents from the eviction backlog, not just in your portfolio, but surrounding competitors. What's your best sense of the inning we're in on that overhang on market fundamentals? And when do you think the Anvil on market rate and occupancy will finally be gone?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So John, this is Michael. That's a hard thing to understand exactly when we think we'll be kind of back to normal. I feel like when you just look at the sheer number of quantities of kind of pending evictions in the marketplace that we have. We are more than kind of two thirds of the way through kind of our backlog. It was a positive sign for us to see that the duration dropped to four months from kind of the six-month average that we saw early in the quarter. But we really need to see another drop down to probably like two months for it to get back to like that normal swing of things. So my guess is, we think about our modeling for next year with L.A. besides some of those top line drivers that Mark just talked about, besides the fact that we have rents on top of prior year, we'll see how kind of how they hold up. We really are looking now at probably another couple of quarters of this pressure from this excess inventory in the market. But when you look at the occupancy for the quarter, positive is that while we're getting some of this excess inventory occurring, we are able to rent those units out and we are getting new residents in that pay the rent. So that's a positive to us. It's just taking us a little bit longer to backfill some of those units than you otherwise would have had in normal market conditions.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nMark Parrell: Good morning.\nJohn Kim: You talked about the net migration trends being favorable to Seattle and San Francisco. Where are the residents coming from? Is this a reversal of the Sunbelt migration you've seen in the last few years?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. John, it's Michael. So it's not so much the migration is happening or in migrations happening from out of state. What we're seeing is the migration patterns are shifting from being 20-plus miles out coming near in. So it could even be within the same MSA, they're just coming near or in to us. So that's another source of demand for us. You are seeing kind of some out-of-state in migration occur, but it's still not back to like what we saw in like the pre-pandemic era. We're still slightly elevated from getting more of our new residents from within the MSA.\nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question is on the Blackstone acquisition. I realize it's immediately accretive to earnings. You bought it below replacement costs. But the operating environment in your expansion markets are going backwards, maybe more quicker than you anticipated. Could you have waited on acquiring assets in these markets given NOI is going negative in some of these markets?\nMark Parrell: Yes. It's Mark. Boy, I wish we were that present. We've talked before on the trade-off here, you're going to get some weaker gross rental growth numbers, but you're going to get a better price now and then we'll likely continue to be a buyer, and you'll probably pay a higher price and you'll have less of that rental growth weakness. Frankly, it's very, very early on that deal, but everything is tracking very consistently to slightly better than our numbers in a pro forma. So again, the Sunbelt is weak, we expected it to be weak. Those are pretty well exactly as weak as we thought they'd be. And again, we do run things differently. Michael is an excellent operator, and he and his team, there are things we can do better in terms of delinquency management and vacancy management that even if rents are going down, we can underwrite, and we see those sorts of improvements. So I guess I don't have any regrets about the timing, because I think your dollar cost little into this I think we really love our basis here with that kind of replacement cost discount. And I think in a few quarters, you're going to start to see some improvement in the second derivative in the Sunbelt, but it's going to take a while for our big three Sunbelt markets to see significant improvement in same-store revenue. We did assume that would take a little bit longer.\nAlex Brackenridge: And John, it's Alex. We are in just those specific three Sunbelt markets, two when you think of Denver being outside the Sunbelt, not in some of the markets that are just seeing massively historic amounts of oversupply. So our \u2013 we feel like there's a little more digestible over time. We are not \u2013 we have not been buying in Austin as an example, where we do have three properties, but we're standing pat because the amount of supply is just sold for whaling.\nJohn Kim: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nAmi Probandt: Hi, this is Ami on for Michael. Have you been seeing the same in-migration trends for the East Coast markets as you've been seeing in the Seattle or San Francisco?\nMichael Manelis: Ami, this is Michael. So really, when you look across the East Coast markets, our migration patterns are very much in line with pre-pandemic kind of norms, both from how we're actually attaining new residents and we also watch when residents leave us where are they going, both the out migration and the immigration patterns across those East Coast markets very much in line with historical norms that we saw back in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nAmi Probandt: Okay. And then one on bad debt. How are the bad debt new levels of bad debt, so for new residents coming in the door, bad debt levels presidents trending? Is this in line with historical or elevated below normal?\nBob Garechana: Yes, it's Bob. So in terms of new entrants from a bad debt standpoint, it's very wise. So it's normalized back to pre-pandemic levels. So the quantity of nonpaying residents that are coming in the front door, has very much normalized back to new \u2013 to pre-pandemic levels. The thing you have to keep in mind and the thing that we keep in mind as we manage this is that if eviction processes take longer, each one of those quantity of people actually still cost more. So we have a bunch of initiatives and technology that we utilize to try to actually make it lower than normal to the extent that we think the eviction process is going to be extended. But in terms of quality of resident kind of getting at that level, it's still very high quality, still low percentage of people coming through that don't pay.\nAmi Probandt: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go now to Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's [indiscernible] along with Nick. Maybe following up on John's question from earlier. Alex, how are you underwriting rent growth on new acquisitions today in those higher supply markets? And I think you mentioned flat in the first year or two, but that probably assumes some high growth in the out year. So curious how you were maybe just generally private market players are baking in that rent growth to get the IRR math to work?\nAlex Brackenridge: Hey, Daniel, it's Alex. So every property is a little different, but certainly, all three markets are seeing higher than historic supply. So over \u2013 across the board, the first year has always been less, a little bit less than what the prior year was. The second year is maybe flattish to a little bit less. But part of that is offset by operating efficiencies that we have from our platform and other income that we're layering in. So the net-net is an improvement by the end of the second year. And then we do think that in years three and four, we will see outsized growth. So if you thought the historic norm might be 3%, 3.5%, I think 4.5% is going to be highly achievable. And so we do factor that in \u2013 depending a little bit on the approximate supply for each asset, but that's generally the trend that we show.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sorry, I was on mute. I appreciate that. And then I had a follow-up maybe for Mark. Just wanted to ask your high-level thinking on the election, different legislative things. Are there different \u2013 like what are the variables maybe you're focused on? Maybe what's less topical now? And do you think maybe could be more topical next week or next year?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks for that question. I mean, of course, the federal election is getting a lot of notice. I will say state and local government is generally more impactful to our business. And so most of our focus and the industry's focus has been on Proposition 33 in California, and we've been very active there, and we remain optimistic that Californians will reject for the third time this sort of anti-housing rent control proposal. So that is certainly topical. Depending on the President, there is a difference in approach there. The federal government has important levers it can pull in terms of the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and how they put capital into the market and FHA and HUD as well. So I guess that's an impact. So we'll have to see all that settle out. And then, of course, whoever is President will inherit some challenging budget circumstances, and we'll see how that impacts things like the voucher programs, expansions of the which is the low income housing program. Middle income housing tax credit program in the industry is advocating for. So there's a lot of topics on the table that I hope in a week, we know a little bit more certainty. But the main discussions that the industry is having right now and the main focus are the state ballot initiative in California. And we've had some terrific lock across the country in the last year or so, whether it's the Massachusetts housing bill, which was very supply focused, very much trying to generate affordable housing, whether it's in Florida, a very different government there, of course, their housing bill, which again focused on supply and zoning reform, California, transit-oriented development, Governor is focused on. So I think everyone gets the message about supply being a solution. I think the industry has just got to push that, whether it's the federal or state level, as well as voucher enhancement in public-private partnerships like 421-a and the BTI [ph] program in Seattle and things like that. So again, I think we're going to have a great dialogue when the smoke clears, but for a week or maybe a little longer, there's going to be a little uncertainty.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: We'll go next to Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time. I wanted to ask maybe a couple of quick ones. Where is the loss to lease in the portfolio today? And where are you sending out renewals for November, December here?\nMichael Manelis: Hey, Adam, this is Michael. So first, I'll just start off. So the loss to lease \u2013 and maybe I'll just back up. So at the beginning of the year, we actually started in a moderate gain to lease position at about 60 basis points. And then as that pricing can kind of improve kind of we moved ourselves back into a loss to lease position. As of kind of the middle of the month, October 15, we were in a slight gain to lease of about 10 basis points which, again, it kind of tells us that we're going to wind up at the end of the year in a normal range. Because any given year, you can start in a slight gain or a slight loss to lease position, but that's kind of where we're positioned right now. We do have a little bit of that easier comp in the fourth quarter in a couple of these markets. So we'll see kind of how that plays into the final year-end number. In terms of the renewals, right now, our quotes are out in the marketplace for the next 90 days. We still expect to continue to renew a high percentage of our residents. We put some stats in there. We've been really focused on that, the customer service side of the business and leveraging our centralized team. With the quotes that are out in the marketplace that are around a 6.5% or 7%, we expect to achieve around a 4.7% renewal increase, or a little bit better because, obviously, if the markets continue to improve some of those West Coast markets, we have the ability to kind of dial down some of the negotiations that we're doing, which could produce a little bit higher results in the quarter for us.\nAdam Kramer: Great. That's really helpful, Michael. Thank you. And just maybe switching gears on kind of external growth, maybe a two-parter here. I guess first part is just when you're thinking about dispositions going forward, which markets are you focused on? And then the second part of that is, obviously, pretty quite here with this large portfolio. Is there more to come? And if so, is it kind of more on the one-off side of things? Or is there the potential for kind of further portfolio opportunities here?\nAlex Brackenridge: Hey, Adam, it's Alex. First, on the dispo question. As we've talked about in the past, we are focused on decreasing the exposure in California, and we've done that recently, and we'll continue to do that. We'd also decreased more in the urban core of a couple of other cities as well outside of California. It's just not a great bid right now for that yet. But we're starting to hear requests for information about properties. We're talking to people who are kind of taking a contrarian view. But as you know, we're never in a position where we have to sell something. So we're just kind of waiting for the market to come to us a little bit on that. But I think you'll see us continue to spread our footprint into these expansion markets and then within our coastal markets become more \u2013 a little bit more suburban than we are right now. So a little more urban, but brought the market to come to us a little bit, and we have the ability to sell other assets while we're waiting for that to happen. In terms of the one-offs versus portfolios, we're out there trying to create opportunity every day. That's how the Blackstone deal came about, and we're talking to any of the major developers or owners and we would love to do business and volume. And if not, we'll keep doing the one-offs, but we expect to be able to find more opportunities like the Blackstone deal.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJosh Dennerlein: Hey guys. I just wanted to follow up on one of the opening remarks about the resident AI rollout and how you're going to get to 75%, 80% coverage pretty shortly. I guess \u2013 just how should we think about the benefits of this rollout impacting the P&L? And then maybe any thoughts on potential margin improvement opportunity here?\nMichael Manelis: Hey, Josh, this is Michael. So maybe I'll start with the first one and just talk about like what we're doing. So we were early pioneers of kind of leveraging AI into our leasing process. We did that back in 2019. And you saw that benefit almost immediately in the reduction of on-site kind of payroll or mitigating payroll growth on site as we continue to centralize a lot of those kind of customer experiences. Right now, in this last quarter, what we're doing is we're actually rolling out an AI tool that deals with resident inquiries \u2013 questions that residents have not necessarily prospects. And what we hope to see with that is that as these kind of machine learning applications get in there, they get better and better. Out of the box, we started with like 60% coverage of being able to answer inquiries from our residents. We think over the next couple of quarters, we'll get to that 75%, 80%. And really, what you get then is you get another layer of operating efficiencies, whether that's the on-site side, where we're able to kind of pot or flex staff across multiple properties even further than what we've already done or you start looking into our centralized teams and you say where can we create efficiencies there so we could take on new tasks. So we're really excited. And again, this is something that we're never done with, but you're seeing some of these applications come to the market that really do have a pretty quick impact on the operations of the company. And the second part of your question, I just want to make sure I understood. Were you talking about like market upside?\nJosh Dennerlein: No. I guess, sorry, just like margin expansion opportunity across the portfolio, it seems like this might generate some expense savings. So just trying to think about the opportunity set here?\nMark Parrell: Yes. I'm not sure, it's Mark. How much margin improvement as much as it is just blunting the rate of inflation, I mean, you've got a fair bit of growth of just various costs, I mean just break payroll as well as medical and the rest of it. And I think what you've seen us do is kind of hold those costs to sub-inflationary levels. And when we do that and we grow revenue, that's the margin improvement. But again, we seek to be closer to 70% better in that number, but a little bit of this is just being, and I think Bob Garechana said it well on the last call, whatever you think inflation is, we're a little bit below it. And this is part of that sort of effort.\nJosh Dennerlein: Thanks guys.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs.\nJulien Blouin: Yes. Thank you for the question. Bob, you talked about an openness to continue to deploy leverage capacity here. Maybe, I guess, bigger picture, I get the geographic mix reasons for the acquisitions. But why does now feel like the right time to be deploying your leverage capacity into acquisitions when maybe the spread between cap rates and your cost of debt remains at some of the tightest levels in maybe the last decade?\nMark Parrell: Interesting. It's Mark. I'm going to start, and Alex may add to it. Cap rates aren't the only inputs to this calculus. I mean replacement cost is really important, too. And as we've said on prior calls, the replacement cost thing isn't just about buying an asset at a good basis; it means that's unlikely to be a lot of supply there because it's not an economic incentive to build. So there is, in our minds probably much better revenue growth prospects especially in the outer years, as Alex just described, years three and four than what we've underwritten. And so that's a little bit of what we're buying as well here. In terms of the spread between our cost of funds and the disposition assets and the like, you also have to think about CapEx. The assets we're buying generally are pretty new and have relatively little capital. You saw us sell and we'll continue to sell these much older assets with a bigger capital load. So when you think about AFFO kind of yields, those are better, then they look on the surface on the FFO side. So I think there's a few things going on here. And I also say apartments are such a desirable and liquid asset class, the idea that you're going to get like you do in some other sectors that are less well owned these gaps between your cost of capital and what you can invest at, that's just not realistic. We just don't see that happen often or at all in the last, I guess, almost decade. So I guess I'd end with that comment that, that sort of view would be great if it happened. But I think some other sectors have that happen a lot more, and that means that frankly, they don't trade very well in the private market. And our assets do trade really well in our super liquid, and that means they tend to compress to the cost of capital more quickly.\nJulien Blouin: Got it. And maybe sort of thinking about the other potential use of capital development. I know your view sort of over an entire cycle that acquisitions produced sort of better risk-adjusted returns on your capital. But I guess at this point in the cycle, why not maybe tilt more aggressively towards developments? I know you expect to complete $780 million in 2024 and 2025. But I guess, why not sort of bring that a little bit higher?\nAlex Brackenridge: Hey Julien, it's Alex. The markets that we're particularly interested in like Denver, Dallas and Atlanta have all the supply coming. So sure, we could look at building into those markets. But I'm not really sure that that's the most best risk-adjusted return that we're going to get when you look at the amount of opportunity we're going to have to kind of cherry big properties that really work well for us. So our development instead is focused on places where we don't see those buying opportunities. And that's why you saw us with starts in suburban Seattle and suburban Boston, where we looked historically at how hard it was to amass a portfolio with one-off acquisitions.\nJulien Blouin: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman: Thanks. I know we've covered a lot of ground here. I guess, just thinking about insurance, I know your renewal doesn't come up until March, but can you give us any initial thoughts just where you think property insurance or commercial property insurance rates are heading and what your conversations be?\nMark Parrell: Hey Jamie, it's Mark. Coincidently, I was just talking to the risk management team yesterday about that. So our renewal on our property is done in March of each year. And just to remind everyone, our increase was about 10% year-over-year, and that included us enhancing increasing our coverage a bit as well. So we had a pretty good renewal we thought. And remember we didn't have those giant renewals, a lot of the folks with more hurricane exposure. We don't own in places that have windstorm risk, so that's a huge benefit to us. But having spoken through our risk management team to ensure the two big stores this year, people don't feel will have a big impact on 2025 renewals at this point because the insurers had apparently relatively little exposure to Helen, and the exposure that was triggered on Milton, which could be $50 billion of insurance losses was within what they thought they would underwrite to. So it appears to us that the insurance market was mostly prepared for what occurred. I can't give you an exact number because we're still rolling up budgets. But we don't see yet. We're not hearing from insurers that this is like after Hurricane Ian where there's sort of a catastrophic increase in insurance rates coming across the whole property sector.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Thank you for that. And then I guess just quickly for Bob, the debt coming due in 2025, any initial thought on timing of when you'll try to get after that?\nBob Garechana: Yes. So we have about $500 million coming due, as you mentioned in 2025, which is kind of in the middle of the year. So we'll look at the market opportunistically. $500 million for a company of our size, our liquidity, our credit rating is not particularly large. So really, we'll just be opportunistic at how we minimize what that cost is. And we have a lot of \u2013 like I mentioned in response to some other questions. We have a lot of variables that we can pull in terms of tenor, in terms of size, in terms of all of that stuff and the maturity is in June, by the way. But we have a lot of \u2013 just a lot of leverage and a lot of excellent access to capital in the mix of tools that we can use. So very manageable.\nJamie Feldman: Are there any types of instruments that look particularly interesting to you now?\nBob Garechana: It's so volatile lately that it changes almost on a daily basis. Like the 10-year $600 million that wasn't that long ago that we did in September, when we kind of bottomed ticked the treasury of 3.75. That the 10-year look great, the spreads were low, and it was great. As the curve steepens, obviously, maybe a little bit of shorter tenders begin to become interesting right because you've got you're getting paid for that. And because our duration is so long and because we've got some 30 years outstanding, et cetera, we can take advantage of that. And to be honest with you, we also have \u2013 our target for floating rate exposure is around 15%. We're under that right now. And if the Fed does start cutting more aggressively, doesn't look like they will now, but they might it doesn't hurt to have a little bit of floating rate exposure, too. So it's a little bit of \u2013 it's good to have options. And I think we have a lot of options in seems like with the volatility in the markets right now that every day, something new is more interesting than it was the day before, and we'll have to see as we get closer to what the opportunity looks like.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Great. Thanks for your thoughts on it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nBob Garechana: Hey Linda are you there? We can\u2019t hear you.\nLinda Tsai: Sorry, if this question has been asked already. Is there a sense of when new lease spreads get more positive?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Hey Linda, this is Michael. So the new lease spreads, there's a lot of seasonality that goes into that. And I think what you should expect, and we said this in the prepared remarks. And you can kind of look at Page 5 in that management presentation to understand how pricing trend curves throughout the year. But as we typically will start, we will decelerate in the fourth quarter with those spreads then you start into the first year, you'll start to get some acceleration in your pricing power and that usually then transfer results were the positive new lease spread somewhere in that kind of later first part of the first quarter.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Alex Kim with Zelman & Associates.\nAlex Kim: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm going to \u2013 piggyback off Julian's second question a bit here. Can you talk through what you're seeing in your expansion markets that makes them so attractive on a long-term system and then. I guess, just any other markets that you're looking at that fit that criteria as well?\nAlex Brackenridge: Hey Alex, it's Alex. We're really following our customer. We see these high-tech jobs in marketplaces that didn't use to have them in volume like Denver, Dallas and Atlanta an example. And so we're \u2013 that will be the principle that guides us. And we continue to see good numbers coming out of those places, particularly Dallas, which has been fantastic recently in terms of the demand side. Other markets that we've talked about are specific to North Carolina, Charlotte and Raleigh because they have many of those very same dynamics with the really great tech job base, particularly in the Raleigh area and then more finance in Charlotte. But we've been slow to get going on that because like Austin, the amount of supply is just daunting. And when that really gets absorbed, it's hard to project right now. So we're willing to accept some dilution, but there's a limit to how much we want to accept. So I think you might see us enter those markets in a little bit when that becomes a little more clear.\nAlex Kim: Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: We go next to Rich Anderson with Wedbush.\nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So first question on the Blackstone deal. Bob, what's the longer- term out plan on the CP side of the financing?\nBob Garechana: So in the near term, a good component of it will be disposition proceeds because it was \u2013 the CP balance was partially elevated just from timing and disposition. So we still have, call it, with our guidance like $400 million or so of dispositions that we have planned for the back half of this year or for the fourth quarter, could slip into early Q1 of next year. But that will bring our CP balance back to kind of what is the normal line that we call it $500 million to $700 million or keep it around that level. So it's really disposed.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And then a bigger picture perhaps for Mark. In 2016, the company sold, not \u2013 it's probably not fair to call it all suburb or Sunbelt, but a chunk of Sunbelt to Barry Sternlich that was almost 10 years ago, and now you're kind of reversing course with the expansion today. Is this all a function of how tech business has moved in business-friendly climates have gotten better and other areas outside of, say, California and so on? Or is there something else that has caused the company to sort of arguably reverse course on the Sunbelt? And why you're doing this now versus the decision you made eight years ago? Thanks.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Rich. It's good to talk to someone who has such a long amount of history in our business. You look at every one of our competitors and their market mix is morphed. We may be more vocal and more communicative about it. The people have left tertiary markets and focus, they've left lower-end renters in Sunbelt markets and focused on higher. So just to be fair, I mean, really every company does adjust to circumstances and be among them. I would say several things changed. Regulatory risk became more significant in some of our coastal markets. And for a while, you might remember, we thought it was a big advantage because no could build in those markets. But it got challenging enough for some of those states and some of those jurisdictions became difficult. Alex mentioned following our customer, which is kind of our buy line. And our customer, there are more higher-end jobs in the Sunbelt markets like Atlanta than there was when we exited those markets. And the other part that goes with that is housings are lot more expensive in those places. So it used to be our best renter in Atlanta. They'd be with six months and they buy a home. And our worst rider would move out in the middle of the night and it was a pretty low quality tenancy, all right? And that's really changed. You go to these places and much higher quality job growth. So it was a combination of regulatory risk, following our residents and much higher single-family housing costs in desirable areas.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Good luck. Thanks very much.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mark Parrell for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Melinda. As we close the call, I want to thank my colleagues at our Augusta, Georgia Accounting Center for the work above and beyond the call of duty to close our books in the aftermath of what Hurricane Helene's terrible damage was to that city. I salute all of you and the folks in the counting here in Chicago; we picked up the slack and got all our quarter end financial work done on time. There are other conference call listeners, thanks for your time today, and we'll see you on the conference circuit for the rest of the year. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Alex. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our third quarter 2024 operating performance, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year and what the setup for 2025 could look like. As Mark mentioned, fundamentals in our business remain solid. During the third quarter, our focus on serving our customers and our corresponding strong renewal process led to the lowest reported third quarter resident turnover in our history, and strong physical occupancy of 96.1%. Move-outs to buy homes remained extraordinarily low and renewal rate achieved was strong across most markets. Blended rate, however, ended up at the low end of our expectations for the quarter, primarily from lower-than-expected new lease change driven by the City of Los Angeles and continued pressure in our expansion markets. In these markets, the pressure from excess inventory from both eviction-related, existing and new supply, has led us to prioritize occupancy to maximize revenue, which came at the expense of some rate growth during the quarter. It is also important to remember that it is often not uncommon to see variability in new lease change over relatively short periods of time. For example, while we saw a steeper and earlier decline than usual and new lease change in the third quarter, we have seen a better picture so far in the fourth quarter for this volatile statistic. Looking at the remainder of the year, our strategy of maximizing revenue by maintaining higher occupancy heading into the quieter months of the year should drive performance along with positive contributions from other income and bad debt net. We still anticipate normal seasonal rent deceleration which will result in negative new lease change in the fourth quarter. But at this point, we are seeing very stable renewal rate achieved results. And of note, Seattle and San Francisco have both a relatively easier pricing comp in the fourth quarter and have shown good early signs of improvement, including maintaining strong occupancy and reducing concession usage. Sitting here today, our net effective rents at the portfolio level are close to 2% above prior year, which is also a solid position to be in. Now let me give you some color on the market starting with East Coast. The Boston market is one of our best performers in 2024. Both our urban and suburban portfolios are performing well, but consistent with our expectations, the urban portfolio produced stronger results in the third quarter. We like our positioning here as our urban-centric portfolio will see very little competitive new supply for the remainder of 2024 and the full year of 2025. Moving on to New York, demand feels good as we are more than 97% occupied. And as we have said on past calls, with a solid job market and very little competitive new supply, we think this market will continue to produce good revenue growth, and we'll have some of the best supply-demand dynamics in the country for the next couple of years. Rounding out the East Coast, Washington, D.C. continues to be the rock star of 2024. The market is over 96.5% occupied and is producing some of the top rental rate growth in our portfolio. Demand feels good across all of our submarkets and is expected to continue but we do expect some pressure from deliveries in the fourth quarter, particularly in the central D.C. submarket. On the West Coast, as I mentioned, Los Angeles showed some weakness in blended rate growth, particularly in the new lease change. We think there are a few factors in play here. First, our overall pricing power here was clearly impacted by less job growth than anticipated, especially office using jobs and a bit of a pause from the L.A. studios in the content production. Second, on supply, we are seeing some competitive new supply, particularly in the downtown, Koreatown and West L.A. submarkets, as well as some excess supply coming online due to continued improvements in the eviction process, which is now taking about four months, down from six months earlier in the year. Finally, the city is still working through some quality of life issues in the urban submarkets like Koreatown and Downtown L.A. Our suburban portfolios, primarily driven by Santa Clarita and Ventura County, are performing better than our urban submarkets. The good news is that we are seeing some positive momentum across the entire Los Angeles market right now. And with our rents on top of last year, a condition we have not seen all year long, puts us in a favorable position. In addition, today's occupancy is running 40 basis points above both the prior year and is trending positively versus the third quarter. We are also experiencing some of the highest retention rates of the year in Los Angeles. And while job growth has been somewhat muted in 2024, projections for Moody Analytics are much more positive for growth in Los Angeles in 2025, particularly office-using jobs. Assuming that comes to pass, then along with the modest new apartment deliveries in most places across this vast geography, we think we should drive a reacceleration of results in 2025. In the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County, we continue to see demand but evidence of some price sensitivity with residents willing to move further out in these markets for affordability reasons. After showing some of the best growth in the portfolio over the last few years, we are likely returning to more normal long-term growth rates. Rounding out the West Coast, San Francisco and Seattle continue to perform better than our original modest expectations. At this point, we feel good about the pace of recovery in these two markets and they are set up to contribute to growth in 2025, and we have included a page in the management presentation that highlights some of the favorable trends we are already seeing in these markets. In San Francisco, demand feels good with occupancy of 96.2%, which is 90 basis points higher than last year. Rents are following normal seasonal patterns, but we are seeing slower deceleration compared to last year and renewals are performing well. In addition, some impactful return to office policy from firms like Salesforce, are helping to drive significant improvements to street activation. Having just spent a week in the market, you can really feel the energy and a reminder of why this market is the center of the tech universe, including the rapidly growing AI sector. On the supply side, there is very little new supply coming to the market. Overall starts are way down, and there have been almost no new competitive starts for the last year, which supports improving conditions for the next couple of years. We are optimistic about this market and its ability to drive our results in 2025. In Seattle, the recovery feels similar to San Francisco but further along. During the third quarter, same-store revenue reflected improvement driven by low turnover, strong occupancy and better-than-expected renewal rate achieved. New lease change, while still more negative than we would like is better than last year, and we would expect this metric to improve over time. As we sit here today, demand drivers are better than we thought. Our occupancy is over 96% and our renewal performance remains strong. And looking at our migration patterns, we are also seeing more people come to us from further out suburbs, which is an additional demand driver for our assets. The big recent story here is the five-day week return-to-office announcement from Amazon, which is the 800-pound gorilla in the market. For the past several weeks, our local team have reported increased interest from Amazon folks who are living further away from the office and looking for apartment homes in the downtown and South Lake Union submarkets. With focus from city government and the local business community, along with increased business and tourist foot traffic, livability in the downtown just keeps getting better. Another reason positive is that the tech employment in the market looks solid as we see more postings for physicians in both the city of Seattle and Bellevue, Redmond's area. As previously discussed, there is supply coming in the fourth quarter, and we will need to see how the demand and pricing holds. But at present, it should finish the year strong and like San Francisco, we have some real optimism on this market and what it can contribute in 2025. Switching to the expansion markets. The volume of competitive new supply continues to impact both occupancy and rate. Denver is our best performer of the expansion markets and our relatively small same-store portfolios in the other expansion markets, Dallas is producing the best revenue results in Atlanta where we have the most direct exposure to new supply right now is the worst. We continue to see demand, but it is a challenging operating environment for both new lease and retention given the amount of new supply. Similar to last quarter, the pressure on new leases makes renewing residents and maintaining occupancy, the number one priority for these markets. As you know, we added a number of new suburban assets to our portfolio in Atlanta, Dallas and Denver during the quarter that will have a while before they are in our same-store reported results. Overall, we are excited to grow our portfolio and create operating scale in these markets. While these markets have near-term supply risk, they continue to demonstrate long-term demand from our target renter demographic and provide a nice balance to our core portfolio. On the innovation front, we are very pleased with the initial results of our new AI resident inquiry application, which was able to handle almost 60% of our inquiries in our test market. We have a lot of confidence that as this application keeps learning we will get to 75% to 80% coverage, which will create an additional layer of operating efficiencies in the company. Looking ahead, now that we have centralized the support of many parts of our customer journey, we are looking forward to improving and optimizing those processes, including the upcoming efforts to streamline the leasing process to make it faster and easier for our renters. Before I discuss the 2025 building blocks, I would like to highlight our expense performance in the quarter. Continued favorable results on property taxes, low increases on repairs and maintenance and utilities and an actual decrease in on-site payroll drove the quarterly results and should get us to our expected 3% midpoint for the year. We are very proud of our 10-year same-store expense compounded annual growth rate of 3.2% and consider cost control and innovation implementation as core to our DNA at EQR. In closing, as Mark mentioned, while it's still too early to give 2025 guidance on Page 7 in the management presentation that we have published last night, we gave some building blocks for next year's revenue performance. Overall, the setup for 2025 feels solid. Today, we expect that we will start the year with embedded growth near 1% and in a very well-occupied position. We also have a very favorable setup as the expected deliveries of competitive new supply in our established markets will be lower again. And while the expansion markets still have significant supply expected, the absolute quantity is beginning to come down. On top of all of that, we like our ability to attract and retain new residents. In particular, we are most excited about the potential we see from our focus on the customer and our ability to maintain occupancy along with the upside we see from our West Coast markets of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, which make up 42% of the company's NOI. Those factors, coupled with the continued performance in our East Coast markets should deliver solid revenue results for the company in 2025. I want to thank our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation, enhancing customer service and their exceptional disciplined approach to expense management. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Hey Steve, this is Michael. Maybe I'll just start and just say. So first, we're just \u2013 we're in the very early stages of our kind of budget process that we're putting in all those factors that you just described. In terms of the leasing spreads and how to think about this, I revert back to kind of this Page 5 in the management presentation that really talks more about just the pricing trend and what's happening with absolute market rent growth, kind of on a year-over-year basis because that's really going to be the catalyst that's going to drive a lot of that. Right now, a lot of the factors for the setup for 2025 feel very similar as we were heading into 2024 and how we talked about it. But I still think it's a little bit too early for me to kind of give you the guidance on where we think intra-period like market rent is going to grow. But I don't \u2013 I mean we have a lot of things that are set up to be catalyst for us, but we also know we still got to work through some of the absorption of supply in some of these markets. So I think we'll just see kind of how this plays out for the next couple of quarters. Yes, good morning, Haendel, this is Michael. So I think what I would start and just say is let's just back up and think about the third quarter. So what we saw in the third quarter and it was really the later part of the third quarter is, we've had an occupancy kind of bias. We've been leaning into that. And specific to really the city of Los Angeles and the expansion markets, we did drop some of the rates, we increased some of the concession usage. And you can kind of see that on Page 5 in that pricing trend where you just didn't have as much robust kind of pricing power near the tail end of the quarter. And that translated right into that new lease change for us for the number. Where we sit here now in October, right, we've got a setup where you do \u2013 like you said, we have a little bit of an easier comp coming at us in Seattle and San Francisco. I've got a market like Los Angeles, right now have rents on top of prior year, and that's a condition we haven't seen all year long. So now you look at the October stats and you feel like you're pretty well positioned, but I've said before, right, these metrics are best viewed over a longer period of time versus kind of any stand-alone month, especially kind of given the quantities. And like specific to the fourth quarter and like our assumptions for that blended rate growth between 75 and 125 basis point growth. We have fairly stable achieved renewal rate increases kind of expected, and we are allowing for some continued moderation of new lease change. But the setup right now in the first month, we still got two-thirds of the quarter to get through feels pretty good to us. Yes. Alex, this is Michael. I could start off here. So first, I just spent a week in San Francisco, and you could feel it and the on-site teams will tell you just based on the prospects that are showing up for the tours, what's driving some of that. So the migration patterns show people from further out coming back near in, when they walk into the office, they're talking about the fact that they need to be back into the office for work several days a week, and that's driving a lot of their decisions. So it's still a little bit early, I would say, in San Francisco to feel it. But when you have the big company like Salesforce making that announcement, you see the activity in the ground and the office is from the prospect. A lot of the other peripheral companies start to follow some of those bigger tech companies. And this is probably the most serious we've seen them actually talk about all of this in the marketplace. Specific to Seattle, I'll tell you, we could see it like job postings from some of the major tech providers in that market are up in the city of Seattle, job postings in Bellevue, Redmond are up. Our on-site team, we've been talking to them like every week for the past several weeks once that Amazon announcement came out. And the Amazon employees are trying to get out in front of that January start date because they're concerned that there's going to be this pent-up demand coming in, and that either the rates or the availability of certain apartments won't be there in the marketplace. So they're actually buying early from us. So we could see it right now, and Seattle just feels a little bit further along than San Francisco from that, and we feel like Amazon is really kind of serious about what they're saying to their teams. Well, I mean, I think we saw these trends in migration patterns even last quarter, and we did put some good details on Page 8 in the management presentation that talk about kind of not only that urban suburban mix, but what we're actually seeing the fact that concessions are down 40% year-over-year. But I think we've seen some of these migration patterns. We've heard some of this before from our new residents moving in. And I think when you look at what the comp looks like, the comp line of our pricing trends for the fourth quarter, this time last year, we were issuing concessions, right? We had rents decelerating. And right now, while you're still seeing some normal kind of rent deceleration there, the concession use is actually kind of abating or softening a little bit in the downtown kind of submarkets. So, I think we're just seeing what we would describe as like the greenest shoots that we've seen and felt in a while. Yes. So John, this is Michael. That's a hard thing to understand exactly when we think we'll be kind of back to normal. I feel like when you just look at the sheer number of quantities of kind of pending evictions in the marketplace that we have. We are more than kind of two thirds of the way through kind of our backlog. It was a positive sign for us to see that the duration dropped to four months from kind of the six-month average that we saw early in the quarter. But we really need to see another drop down to probably like two months for it to get back to like that normal swing of things. So my guess is, we think about our modeling for next year with L.A. besides some of those top line drivers that Mark just talked about, besides the fact that we have rents on top of prior year, we'll see how kind of how they hold up. We really are looking now at probably another couple of quarters of this pressure from this excess inventory in the market. But when you look at the occupancy for the quarter, positive is that while we're getting some of this excess inventory occurring, we are able to rent those units out and we are getting new residents in that pay the rent. So that's a positive to us. It's just taking us a little bit longer to backfill some of those units than you otherwise would have had in normal market conditions. Yes. John, it's Michael. So it's not so much the migration is happening or in migrations happening from out of state. What we're seeing is the migration patterns are shifting from being 20-plus miles out coming near in. So it could even be within the same MSA, they're just coming near or in to us. So that's another source of demand for us. You are seeing kind of some out-of-state in migration occur, but it's still not back to like what we saw in like the pre-pandemic era. We're still slightly elevated from getting more of our new residents from within the MSA. Ami, this is Michael. So really, when you look across the East Coast markets, our migration patterns are very much in line with pre-pandemic kind of norms, both from how we're actually attaining new residents and we also watch when residents leave us where are they going, both the out migration and the immigration patterns across those East Coast markets very much in line with historical norms that we saw back in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Hey, Adam, this is Michael. So first, I'll just start off. So the loss to lease \u2013 and maybe I'll just back up. So at the beginning of the year, we actually started in a moderate gain to lease position at about 60 basis points. And then as that pricing can kind of improve kind of we moved ourselves back into a loss to lease position. As of kind of the middle of the month, October 15, we were in a slight gain to lease of about 10 basis points which, again, it kind of tells us that we're going to wind up at the end of the year in a normal range. Because any given year, you can start in a slight gain or a slight loss to lease position, but that's kind of where we're positioned right now. We do have a little bit of that easier comp in the fourth quarter in a couple of these markets. So we'll see kind of how that plays into the final year-end number. In terms of the renewals, right now, our quotes are out in the marketplace for the next 90 days. We still expect to continue to renew a high percentage of our residents. We put some stats in there. We've been really focused on that, the customer service side of the business and leveraging our centralized team. With the quotes that are out in the marketplace that are around a 6.5% or 7%, we expect to achieve around a 4.7% renewal increase, or a little bit better because, obviously, if the markets continue to improve some of those West Coast markets, we have the ability to kind of dial down some of the negotiations that we're doing, which could produce a little bit higher results in the quarter for us. Hey, Josh, this is Michael. So maybe I'll start with the first one and just talk about like what we're doing. So we were early pioneers of kind of leveraging AI into our leasing process. We did that back in 2019. And you saw that benefit almost immediately in the reduction of on-site kind of payroll or mitigating payroll growth on site as we continue to centralize a lot of those kind of customer experiences. Right now, in this last quarter, what we're doing is we're actually rolling out an AI tool that deals with resident inquiries \u2013 questions that residents have not necessarily prospects. And what we hope to see with that is that as these kind of machine learning applications get in there, they get better and better. Out of the box, we started with like 60% coverage of being able to answer inquiries from our residents. We think over the next couple of quarters, we'll get to that 75%, 80%. And really, what you get then is you get another layer of operating efficiencies, whether that's the on-site side, where we're able to kind of pot or flex staff across multiple properties even further than what we've already done or you start looking into our centralized teams and you say where can we create efficiencies there so we could take on new tasks. So we're really excited. And again, this is something that we're never done with, but you're seeing some of these applications come to the market that really do have a pretty quick impact on the operations of the company. And the second part of your question, I just want to make sure I understood. Were you talking about like market upside? Yes. Hey Linda, this is Michael. So the new lease spreads, there's a lot of seasonality that goes into that. And I think what you should expect, and we said this in the prepared remarks. And you can kind of look at Page 5 in that management presentation to understand how pricing trend curves throughout the year. But as we typically will start, we will decelerate in the fourth quarter with those spreads then you start into the first year, you'll start to get some acceleration in your pricing power and that usually then transfer results were the positive new lease spread somewhere in that kind of later first part of the first quarter."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2024 results and outlook for the year. I will start us off, then Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, will discuss our recent acquisition of Blackstone and the overall transaction market. And then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will speak to our operating performance, then we'll go ahead and take your questions. We posted solid performance in the third quarter, driven by continued good demand and little competitive new supply in our established markets, which constitute 90% of our portfolio. Big picture, we continue to see a stable environment and a healthy consumer. Unemployment is low and wage growth is steady, both of which bodes well for our customers. In a moment, Michael will speak to the various puts and takes we saw in our operations during the quarter. As is usually the case, we saw some items like occupancy and retention exceed our expectations, while others like blended rate came in lower in terms of our expectations. As you can see on Page 5 of the management presentation that we posted to our website last night, this type of variability in pricing is not uncommon. In fact, pricing so far in the fourth quarter has normalized consistent with seasonal patterns and with our expectations. In sum, we remain on track with our same-store revenue guidance, and we expect to end the year in a good position for 2025. On the expense side, the machine continues to churn out to terrific results with same-store expense growth of 3.2% for the quarter and our expectation for full year same-store expense growth of 3%. I want to thank the team across our organization for their continuing focus on innovation, cost control and our customer. Turning to 2025, while there remains a considerable amount of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, that could impact our business and the economy generally, we like our setup. We are too early to give 2025 guidance at this point, but we have given you some insight into our preliminary thinking on some of the inputs for 2025 same-store revenue on Pages 7 through 9 of the management presentation. In sum, we think 2025 should produce solid same-store revenue results for Equity Residential. We see steady demand from a well-employed affluent renter base, a favorable supply picker and the 90% of our NOI in the less supplied established markets and continuing cost and lifestyle preferences favoring rental housing. In terms of our expansion markets, we expect that a recovery in same-store revenue will not occur until 2026, given continuing high supply levels, but we do hope to see some improvement in currently highly negative new lease rates and to see lower concessions during next year's leasing season. Now switching over to capital allocation. We accelerated our acquisitions of newer, well-located assets in our expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Denver in the third quarter. We are excited to acquire these properties at a basis that we see as highly favorable and add properties with strong cash flow growth prospects as supply levels declined substantially over the next few years. The entire equity team also looks forward to demonstrating our core competencies of smartly acquiring and efficiently integrating new acquisitions. We now have approximately 10% of our net operating income in our expansion markets assuming stabilization of our assets under development. In a moment, Alex will give you more detail on our transaction activity. We are funding our expected $1.6 billion in acquisitions this year, with a mix of fixed rate debt, dispositions and the use of commercial paper supported by our unsecured line of credit. In a moment, Alex will give you detail on the disposition activity funding these acquisitions. The one source I did want to highlight is the $600 million in fixed rate debt we raised in September. These 10-year notes were issued at a coupon of 4.65%, which is the lowest 10-year coupon issued in the REIT space since 2022, and would be hard to replicate today. So, a nice job by Bob and his team on this. Before I close, a quick note on where these acquisitions fit into our overall capital allocation strategy. Our goal remains to own an apartment portfolio that has the highest long-term total return in the sector with a focus on cash flow growth and taking into account risk and with the least amount of volatility possible. We intend to achieve this goal by catering to well-earning renters in the 12 or so metro areas that we think have the most desirable lifestyles for this demographic and present the best balance of long-term supply, demand, regulatory and resiliency opportunities and risks and where we can efficiently operate our properties with our industry-leading people and systems. As the last few years have shown, there is no riskless apartment market. The volatility and negative rental growth we see in the expansion markets and the strong results we are seeing in our Northeastern markets, many of which were recently left for dead by investors, reinforces our commitment to our strategy of better balancing our portfolio between coastal markets and select sunbelt markets as well as urban and suburban locations. We expect the benefits of this balanced strategy to play out in 2025. Seattle and San Francisco, particularly our uniquely urban portfolios in those markets should generate better same-store revenue results, which, along with the continued strength in the Northeast, and the favorable 2025 supply picture across almost all of our established markets should more than offset continued supply-driven weakness in our expansion markets. In later years, the supply wanes in our expansion markets, those markets will be more of a same-store revenue growth engine for our company. We are confident this balanced geographical strategy, coupled with our efficient operating platform will create value over the long term for our investors, and are eager to demonstrate this over the next several years. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Alex Brackenridge. Hey Steve, it's Mark. You may see a little pressure above that 3%. We talked about on the last call, we've got still pressure from the 421-a burn-off of the tax abatement in New York. So it will be a little there. Certainly, the inflation numbers this morning were a little discouraging. So there may just continue to be some cost pressure. But whatever that number is, we'll be at the low end of it. And I think we'll quantify it for you, so you know exactly what the WiFi impact is. And of course, there's an offsetting much more significant revenue benefit. But I guess, it wouldn't surprise me if the number was a little bit higher than the number we're going to put up this year. But we're still rolling numbers up. Yes. And Haendel, it's Mark. Just to add to that a little bit. This is a give-and-take type process. I mean, we can get new lease rate to be a higher number by letting occupancy decline, and that may not benefit same-store revenue growth, which is our ultimate goal. So we're trying to make as much money as we can in the current quarter and have a nice setup for the next year. But just viewing one factor either in one month or in \u2013 without context to the other ideas. If we were hurting on blended rate and hurting on occupancy. That would be a much more serious situation for us than what happened in September, which thus was just a blip around the average. And a little of this, Alex, it's Mark, is premised on our perspective, gleaned from the Moody's Analytics numbers for next year, that there's going to be some good job growth in the Bay Area in terms of office-using jobs. The barriers shed a lot of tech jobs and the jobs that have been added in AI have not been sufficient to offset those jobs, but we're hopeful that, that reverses itself. So I think when you talk quality of light, Seattle is definitively better. I've been there recently as well, same thing. San Francisco is better but not quite as good. I think LA is less advanced in quality of life considerations being addressed. And then you got this job overlay. And I think on the job overlay side, you feel pretty good about Seattle and you're feeling better about San Francisco and a little bit of what you saw in the third quarter for us was LA being a little sideways on jobs. So we do need that ingredient to come through for these markets to fully recover, but we feel that, we see that. Those are great industries, and I think they will attract and start to hire again if the economy keeps churning. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. It's Mark. Boy, I wish we were that present. We've talked before on the trade-off here, you're going to get some weaker gross rental growth numbers, but you're going to get a better price now and then we'll likely continue to be a buyer, and you'll probably pay a higher price and you'll have less of that rental growth weakness. Frankly, it's very, very early on that deal, but everything is tracking very consistently to slightly better than our numbers in a pro forma. So again, the Sunbelt is weak, we expected it to be weak. Those are pretty well exactly as weak as we thought they'd be. And again, we do run things differently. Michael is an excellent operator, and he and his team, there are things we can do better in terms of delinquency management and vacancy management that even if rents are going down, we can underwrite, and we see those sorts of improvements. So I guess I don't have any regrets about the timing, because I think your dollar cost little into this I think we really love our basis here with that kind of replacement cost discount. And I think in a few quarters, you're going to start to see some improvement in the second derivative in the Sunbelt, but it's going to take a while for our big three Sunbelt markets to see significant improvement in same-store revenue. We did assume that would take a little bit longer. Yes. Thanks for that question. I mean, of course, the federal election is getting a lot of notice. I will say state and local government is generally more impactful to our business. And so most of our focus and the industry's focus has been on Proposition 33 in California, and we've been very active there, and we remain optimistic that Californians will reject for the third time this sort of anti-housing rent control proposal. So that is certainly topical. Depending on the President, there is a difference in approach there. The federal government has important levers it can pull in terms of the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and how they put capital into the market and FHA and HUD as well. So I guess that's an impact. So we'll have to see all that settle out. And then, of course, whoever is President will inherit some challenging budget circumstances, and we'll see how that impacts things like the voucher programs, expansions of the which is the low income housing program. Middle income housing tax credit program in the industry is advocating for. So there's a lot of topics on the table that I hope in a week, we know a little bit more certainty. But the main discussions that the industry is having right now and the main focus are the state ballot initiative in California. And we've had some terrific lock across the country in the last year or so, whether it's the Massachusetts housing bill, which was very supply focused, very much trying to generate affordable housing, whether it's in Florida, a very different government there, of course, their housing bill, which again focused on supply and zoning reform, California, transit-oriented development, Governor is focused on. So I think everyone gets the message about supply being a solution. I think the industry has just got to push that, whether it's the federal or state level, as well as voucher enhancement in public-private partnerships like 421-a and the BTI [ph] program in Seattle and things like that. So again, I think we're going to have a great dialogue when the smoke clears, but for a week or maybe a little longer, there's going to be a little uncertainty. Yes. I'm not sure, it's Mark. How much margin improvement as much as it is just blunting the rate of inflation, I mean, you've got a fair bit of growth of just various costs, I mean just break payroll as well as medical and the rest of it. And I think what you've seen us do is kind of hold those costs to sub-inflationary levels. And when we do that and we grow revenue, that's the margin improvement. But again, we seek to be closer to 70% better in that number, but a little bit of this is just being, and I think Bob Garechana said it well on the last call, whatever you think inflation is, we're a little bit below it. And this is part of that sort of effort. Interesting. It's Mark. I'm going to start, and Alex may add to it. Cap rates aren't the only inputs to this calculus. I mean replacement cost is really important, too. And as we've said on prior calls, the replacement cost thing isn't just about buying an asset at a good basis; it means that's unlikely to be a lot of supply there because it's not an economic incentive to build. So there is, in our minds probably much better revenue growth prospects especially in the outer years, as Alex just described, years three and four than what we've underwritten. And so that's a little bit of what we're buying as well here. In terms of the spread between our cost of funds and the disposition assets and the like, you also have to think about CapEx. The assets we're buying generally are pretty new and have relatively little capital. You saw us sell and we'll continue to sell these much older assets with a bigger capital load. So when you think about AFFO kind of yields, those are better, then they look on the surface on the FFO side. So I think there's a few things going on here. And I also say apartments are such a desirable and liquid asset class, the idea that you're going to get like you do in some other sectors that are less well owned these gaps between your cost of capital and what you can invest at, that's just not realistic. We just don't see that happen often or at all in the last, I guess, almost decade. So I guess I'd end with that comment that, that sort of view would be great if it happened. But I think some other sectors have that happen a lot more, and that means that frankly, they don't trade very well in the private market. And our assets do trade really well in our super liquid, and that means they tend to compress to the cost of capital more quickly. Hey Jamie, it's Mark. Coincidently, I was just talking to the risk management team yesterday about that. So our renewal on our property is done in March of each year. And just to remind everyone, our increase was about 10% year-over-year, and that included us enhancing increasing our coverage a bit as well. So we had a pretty good renewal we thought. And remember we didn't have those giant renewals, a lot of the folks with more hurricane exposure. We don't own in places that have windstorm risk, so that's a huge benefit to us. But having spoken through our risk management team to ensure the two big stores this year, people don't feel will have a big impact on 2025 renewals at this point because the insurers had apparently relatively little exposure to Helen, and the exposure that was triggered on Milton, which could be $50 billion of insurance losses was within what they thought they would underwrite to. So it appears to us that the insurance market was mostly prepared for what occurred. I can't give you an exact number because we're still rolling up budgets. But we don't see yet. We're not hearing from insurers that this is like after Hurricane Ian where there's sort of a catastrophic increase in insurance rates coming across the whole property sector. Thanks, Rich. It's good to talk to someone who has such a long amount of history in our business. You look at every one of our competitors and their market mix is morphed. We may be more vocal and more communicative about it. The people have left tertiary markets and focus, they've left lower-end renters in Sunbelt markets and focused on higher. So just to be fair, I mean, really every company does adjust to circumstances and be among them. I would say several things changed. Regulatory risk became more significant in some of our coastal markets. And for a while, you might remember, we thought it was a big advantage because no could build in those markets. But it got challenging enough for some of those states and some of those jurisdictions became difficult. Alex mentioned following our customer, which is kind of our buy line. And our customer, there are more higher-end jobs in the Sunbelt markets like Atlanta than there was when we exited those markets. And the other part that goes with that is housings are lot more expensive in those places. So it used to be our best renter in Atlanta. They'd be with six months and they buy a home. And our worst rider would move out in the middle of the night and it was a pretty low quality tenancy, all right? And that's really changed. You go to these places and much higher quality job growth. So it was a combination of regulatory risk, following our residents and much higher single-family housing costs in desirable areas. Thank you. Thanks, Melinda. As we close the call, I want to thank my colleagues at our Augusta, Georgia Accounting Center for the work above and beyond the call of duty to close our books in the aftermath of what Hurricane Helene's terrible damage was to that city. I salute all of you and the folks in the counting here in Chicago; we picked up the slack and got all our quarter end financial work done on time. There are other conference call listeners, thanks for your time today, and we'll see you on the conference circuit for the rest of the year. Thank you."

            "name": "Alex Brackenridge",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As we discussed on our call in January, we came to 2024 committed to continuing to reposition our portfolio by increasing our presence in our expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. For the first half of the year, the market remained frozen and we made no progress. However, in the third quarter, as interest rates dropped and the possibility of a soft landing for the economy became more evident, market opened up and we significantly stepped up our activity, closing on 14 assets with over 4,400 units and a total price of $1.26 billion. Those acquisitions were funded by a combination of the proceeds from the $600 million bond issuance that Mark mentioned, $365 million in dispositions and $295 million of commercial paper. The dispositions consisted of six assets located in San Francisco, Washington D.C. and Boston that averaged 43 years old and sold for a 5.7% disposition yield. All of the assets were noncore holdings that had a combination of significant CapEx needs in a variety of operating challenges. The acquisitions meanwhile averaged just seven years old, have limited retail and are all 100% market rate. 11 came from an off-market portfolio from Blackstone that was tailored to fit our expansion strategy in terms of asset quality and locations. Recognizing our ability to provide speed and certainty of execution, Blackstone chose to deal directly with us rather than execute the typical auction process. The other three acquisitions were one-offs purchased for merchant building. After end of the quarter, we closed on an additional asset in Atlanta for $89.5 million. The weighted average cap rate on all this activity was 5% and is anticipated to generate an 8% unleveraged IRR. These transactions appeal to us because they allowed us to expand our presence in markets with strong job growth, increasing numbers of affluent renters and relatively low regulatory risk at an attractive basis that is approximately 15% below estimated replacement cost. Admittedly, these markets are also seeing outsized supply relative to our coastal markets. Accordingly, our underwriting reflects competitive leasing environments for the first two years of our ownership with rental income down or flat depending on the amount of approximate deliveries. We expect that some of that back to NOI will be offset by running these assets more efficiently on the revenue and expense side as we integrate them into our superior operating platform. We anticipate having further opportunities to purchase assets in these markets as the supply pipeline is up in 2026 and more robust rent growth will be on the horizon. But at that time, pricing will likely be at lower cap rates and at a less attractive price relative to replacement costs. As we head into the end of the year and plan for 2025, we expect to continue to see attractive acquisition opportunities at around five cap rates in Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. And with a cost of capital advantage and the ability to complete due diligence quickly relative to leverage buyers expect to close on a sizable share of transaction activity. We currently have an asset in Denver and one in Atlanta, totaling approximately $190 million under contract to close before the end of the year at around a five cap. Austin, our fourth expansion market, where we have only three assets remains challenged with a historic amount of deliveries that is resulting in a highly competitive rental market leading us to stay on the sidelines given hard it is to assess when things will stabilize. With our recent closings and assuming stabilization of development deals in progress, as Mark noted in his comments, we now have approximately 10% of our portfolio in our expansion markets, towards a goal of 20% to 25% that if the transaction market remains favorable, we expect to achieve over the next 18 to 24 months. We are excited to add exposure to these high job growth markets that will see declining supply over the next two to three years. What should not be forgotten, however, is that the reduction in supply is even more dramatic in our coastal markets, where starts are down nearly 60% in 2024 after being down over 30% in 2023. With 2025 starts projected to be down again, we anticipate one of the best supply-demand balances in our coastal markets that we have seen in a very long time. Our expansion market exposure, combined with our coastal market presence, positions us to generate optimal risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders, catering to a customer with a resilient and growing income while balancing out supply, regulatory and resiliency challenges. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Hey Eric, it's Alex. Rates have moved so quickly. It's a little hard to assess that. But I will tell you that as of recently as last week, there were opportunities pricing at like 4.75-ish in markets like Denver and Dallas. So there's a lot of capital, a lot of people interested in apartments. Now we're at a 10 year, it's 4.3 something, maybe that changes a little bit. The reality is with the uncertainty about rates plus the election coming up, there isn't that much product on the market right now. I think this will be a feeling out process for everyone, as we see where things end up, but there's still all this capital. I think overall, the 5% cap rate feels pretty good to me looking forward. And Haendel, in terms of IRR, we underwrite to an unlevered IRR, and then we compare it to our weighted average cost of capital. In this case, with that unlevered IRR was about an 8%, which at that time was in excess of the WACC at that point. And John, it's Alex. We are in just those specific three Sunbelt markets, two when you think of Denver being outside the Sunbelt, not in some of the markets that are just seeing massively historic amounts of oversupply. So our \u2013 we feel like there's a little more digestible over time. We are not \u2013 we have not been buying in Austin as an example, where we do have three properties, but we're standing pat because the amount of supply is just sold for whaling. Hey, Daniel, it's Alex. So every property is a little different, but certainly, all three markets are seeing higher than historic supply. So over \u2013 across the board, the first year has always been less, a little bit less than what the prior year was. The second year is maybe flattish to a little bit less. But part of that is offset by operating efficiencies that we have from our platform and other income that we're layering in. So the net-net is an improvement by the end of the second year. And then we do think that in years three and four, we will see outsized growth. So if you thought the historic norm might be 3%, 3.5%, I think 4.5% is going to be highly achievable. And so we do factor that in \u2013 depending a little bit on the approximate supply for each asset, but that's generally the trend that we show. Hey, Adam, it's Alex. First, on the dispo question. As we've talked about in the past, we are focused on decreasing the exposure in California, and we've done that recently, and we'll continue to do that. We'd also decreased more in the urban core of a couple of other cities as well outside of California. It's just not a great bid right now for that yet. But we're starting to hear requests for information about properties. We're talking to people who are kind of taking a contrarian view. But as you know, we're never in a position where we have to sell something. So we're just kind of waiting for the market to come to us a little bit on that. But I think you'll see us continue to spread our footprint into these expansion markets and then within our coastal markets become more \u2013 a little bit more suburban than we are right now. So a little more urban, but brought the market to come to us a little bit, and we have the ability to sell other assets while we're waiting for that to happen. In terms of the one-offs versus portfolios, we're out there trying to create opportunity every day. That's how the Blackstone deal came about, and we're talking to any of the major developers or owners and we would love to do business and volume. And if not, we'll keep doing the one-offs, but we expect to be able to find more opportunities like the Blackstone deal. Hey Julien, it's Alex. The markets that we're particularly interested in like Denver, Dallas and Atlanta have all the supply coming. So sure, we could look at building into those markets. But I'm not really sure that that's the most best risk-adjusted return that we're going to get when you look at the amount of opportunity we're going to have to kind of cherry big properties that really work well for us. So our development instead is focused on places where we don't see those buying opportunities. And that's why you saw us with starts in suburban Seattle and suburban Boston, where we looked historically at how hard it was to amass a portfolio with one-off acquisitions. Hey Alex, it's Alex. We're really following our customer. We see these high-tech jobs in marketplaces that didn't use to have them in volume like Denver, Dallas and Atlanta an example. And so we're \u2013 that will be the principle that guides us. And we continue to see good numbers coming out of those places, particularly Dallas, which has been fantastic recently in terms of the demand side. Other markets that we've talked about are specific to North Carolina, Charlotte and Raleigh because they have many of those very same dynamics with the really great tech job base, particularly in the Raleigh area and then more finance in Charlotte. But we've been slow to get going on that because like Austin, the amount of supply is just daunting. And when that really gets absorbed, it's hard to project right now. So we're willing to accept some dilution, but there's a limit to how much we want to accept. So I think you might see us enter those markets in a little bit when that becomes a little more clear."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Bob Garechana",
            "content": "Yes. Eric, it's Bob. I'll start, and Michael might augment on some of the other income stuff. But starting with bad debt, we continue to expect to end 2024 around, call it, 1% or maybe slightly better than that of a percentage of revenue. So bad debt as a percentage of revenue. If normal is \u2013 normal, meaning pre-pandemic is around 50 basis points. The opportunity set is delta between there, right. We'll have to see what the progress looks like. We'll have to see what the court system looks like as to whether or not we get all the way there, but to kind of frame a construct of what the opportunity set or contributions incremental growth is, is somewhere between that 1% and back to normalcy. We'll give you more color as we get to the fourth quarter guidance as to what's embedded in our numbers overall. On the other income side, you're correct that a lot of it is \u2013 and we mentioned this, this will be a contributor to fourth quarter performance as well. But a lot of our initiatives were back-end loaded, in terms of their implementation, particularly the bulk WiFi and the adoption of the bulk WiFi. So that will start contributing in a more \u2013 it already has started in the third quarter, but will be more meaningful in the fourth quarter and will continue to contribute as you get into $25 million. With that will come a little bit of expense component, which I think you're familiar with in the industry when you implement this, but there should be good contribution that will be potential for being greater than what you saw in 2024 because of the timing of those rollouts. Yes. So I'll start with the balance sheet, and then I'll pass it over to Alex to talk about the IRR. But we have an incredible, as you pointed out, incredibly underlevered and strong balance sheet. As you may recall, and as those on the call may recall, we have spent a long time frankly, warehousing capital looking for opportunities. And we warehouse capital by paying down debt and going well below our own targeted kind of debt metrics of net debt to EBITDA of 5 to 6 times. And so when the opportunity presented itself on Alex side, we capitalized on that by using the debt capacity we had, and further capitalize on it by the fact that we were able to do so at a very attractive rate overall, particularly with the use of proceeds. So we think that there is a lot more capacity given where the metrics I just outlined and the fact that we're sitting at, call it, 4.6 times. And we would look to use that debt capacity to take advantage of opportunities that make good long-term sense to lock in a really good cost of capital and allow for P&L accretion over time. Yes. So I guess, let me step back and make sure I got the question. But commercial paper for us is kind of short-term floating rate exposure that we use to deal with working capital cycles and working capital for us really means transaction volume. And so the CP program is \u2013 we'll use a portion of it. We use it in the construct of our overall capital structure to balance how much floating rate we have, et cetera, and it much cheaper than our line of credit, right? So we can borrow at, call it, SOFR plus 20 basis points and the line of credit would be contractually SOFR plus 75 or so. But we're really toggling between short-term and long-term issuance when it comes to like the unsecured market by balancing a bunch of factors, right? How much floating rate exposure, what does our liquidity profile look like? What does our maturity profile look like? What does the whole thing look like coupled together, and balancing that out? And because we've done such a great job on the balance sheet over the years and extended our duration and have a lot of capacity to have some short-term usage and some long-term components, we can use a little bit of all pockets to reduce our aggregate cost of capital, which is the goal overall. Yes, it's Bob. So in terms of new entrants from a bad debt standpoint, it's very wise. So it's normalized back to pre-pandemic levels. So the quantity of nonpaying residents that are coming in the front door, has very much normalized back to new \u2013 to pre-pandemic levels. The thing you have to keep in mind and the thing that we keep in mind as we manage this is that if eviction processes take longer, each one of those quantity of people actually still cost more. So we have a bunch of initiatives and technology that we utilize to try to actually make it lower than normal to the extent that we think the eviction process is going to be extended. But in terms of quality of resident kind of getting at that level, it's still very high quality, still low percentage of people coming through that don't pay. Yes. So we have about $500 million coming due, as you mentioned in 2025, which is kind of in the middle of the year. So we'll look at the market opportunistically. $500 million for a company of our size, our liquidity, our credit rating is not particularly large. So really, we'll just be opportunistic at how we minimize what that cost is. And we have a lot of \u2013 like I mentioned in response to some other questions. We have a lot of variables that we can pull in terms of tenor, in terms of size, in terms of all of that stuff and the maturity is in June, by the way. But we have a lot of \u2013 just a lot of leverage and a lot of excellent access to capital in the mix of tools that we can use. So very manageable. It's so volatile lately that it changes almost on a daily basis. Like the 10-year $600 million that wasn't that long ago that we did in September, when we kind of bottomed ticked the treasury of 3.75. That the 10-year look great, the spreads were low, and it was great. As the curve steepens, obviously, maybe a little bit of shorter tenders begin to become interesting right because you've got you're getting paid for that. And because our duration is so long and because we've got some 30 years outstanding, et cetera, we can take advantage of that. And to be honest with you, we also have \u2013 our target for floating rate exposure is around 15%. We're under that right now. And if the Fed does start cutting more aggressively, doesn't look like they will now, but they might it doesn't hurt to have a little bit of floating rate exposure, too. So it's a little bit of \u2013 it's good to have options. And I think we have a lot of options in seems like with the volatility in the markets right now that every day, something new is more interesting than it was the day before, and we'll have to see as we get closer to what the opportunity looks like. Hey Linda are you there? We can't hear you. So in the near term, a good component of it will be disposition proceeds because it was \u2013 the CP balance was partially elevated just from timing and disposition. So we still have, call it, with our guidance like $400 million or so of dispositions that we have planned for the back half of this year or for the fourth quarter, could slip into early Q1 of next year. But that will bring our CP balance back to kind of what is the normal line that we call it $500 million to $700 million or keep it around that level. So it's really disposed."

Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\nMark Parrell: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I will start us off, and then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will discuss our second quarter 2024 revenue results and outlook as well as give some recent highlights from what we call our property operations innovation machine. And then Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our expense results and updated normalized funds from operations guidance, and then we'll take your questions. Looking at our quarterly results. Same-store revenues increased 2.9%, and same-store expenses rose only 2.7%, which led to same-store NOI growth of 3% and an increase in our NFFO per share of 3.2%. So far this year, our revenue performance has exceeded expectations as steady demand across all of our markets has met limited supply in our coastal established markets. As a reminder, approximately 94% of our NOI comes from our coastal established markets. Michael will get into the details shortly, but the Northeastern markets of Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. as well as Seattle are standouts relative to our expectations back in January. Our expansion markets of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver, which together constitutes 6% of our NOI, continue to have good demand, but remain under pressure from continuing high levels of supply with our Atlanta and Austin portfolios most impacted. Putting all of this in a blender, this led us to increase our same-store revenue guidance by 70 basis points at the midpoint to 3.2%. Underlying these positive results and outlook are several trends that continue to support rental housing performance, including high homeownership costs, limited for-sale inventory and a steady though moderating employment picture. We continue to see high levels of retention among our residents due to elevated homeownership costs, with homeownership processing record levels last month, making rental housing a good value alternative. We also see a steady employment picture in our target higher-earning renter demographic leading to sustained good levels of demand. In the second quarter, we saw a continuation of total employment growth across nearly all of our markets. Drilling down the office using employment, we saw a return to positive growth in Q2 for the first time in several quarters, with strong numbers posted by Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Atlanta. And, of course, lifestyle factors like delayed marriage and childbearing, which we've talked about on prior calls, continue to be a positive factor. The expense side of the equation is similarly positive news as we continue to utilize our sector-leading innovation machine to drive improvements in both our cost structure and our resident service experience. We lowered the same-store expense midpoint of our annual guidance by a full percentage point to 3%, leading to a new same-store NOI guidance midpoint of 3.25% for the year, which is 145 basis points better than our prior midpoint. My appreciation to all my outstanding on-site and corporate colleagues, their hard work and dedication to our customers and to supporting each other. Switching to capital allocation. We're seeing more transaction activity as the interest rate climate stabilizes and sellers and buyers cap rate expectations coalesce around 5%. Transaction volumes in our markets in the second quarter of 2024 was almost triple what it was in the first quarter and double what it was in the second quarter of 2023. As you saw in our release, during the second quarter, we acquired one property in suburban Boston. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired a property in Atlanta and one in Dallas. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here to answer your specific questions in a moment. But generally speaking, we are buying recently built properties in our expansion markets at a basis that compares well to replacement cost and underwriting a 5% forward cap rate with our pro forma assuming further degradation of rents, but also assuming the benefits in year one of our more focused delinquency and vacancy management processes. In year two, as we get the acquired properties fully integrated into our superior operating platform, we are assuming that we can pod the acquired properties with our other nearby properties as we obtain scale in these markets and efficiently share employees across properties as we do in our coastal established markets. While we acknowledge that current rent levels are weak in these expansion markets and likely to remain so in the near-term. In the longer-term, we see relief on the way that starts in these oversupplied markets have collapsed and deliveries in 2026 and in 2027 are likely to be much lower than both current levels and historical levels. These expected lower supply levels underpin our property acquisition underwriting in outer years where we expect a significant rental rate recovery. We are excited to acquire these properties at a basis that we see as highly favorable and add properties with strong cash flow growth prospects once supply levels normalize in a few years. The entire Equity team also looks forward to demonstrating our core competencies of smartly acquiring and efficiently integrating new acquisitions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our second quarter 2024 operating performance as well as provide some highlights of our increased same-store operating guidance. As you saw in our release, our overall operating fundamentals remain healthy, driven by good demand across our portfolio and a strong renewal process that resulted in low resident turnover and strong occupancy of 96.4% for the quarter. As Mark mentioned, we are benefiting from what we see as a solid job picture across the country keeping our residents well employed with growing wages as well as very little competitive new supply in our established markets. The rent-to-income ratio on new move-ins during the quarter remained stable at around 20%. Not surprisingly, we are also benefiting from a very low percent of our residents moving out to buy homes. About 7.5% of our move-outs gave bought home as the reason. This is the lowest number we have seen in any given quarter. That, along with the benefits of our centralized renewal process, has made our year-to-date results on renewals, both in terms of the volume of residents renewing and the achieved renewal rate increases, a key driver to our outperformance. As has been the case for a while now, our East Coast markets are the best performers with occupancies around 97%. On the West Coast, Seattle is performing particularly well, and San Francisco is showing improvement but not quite at the pace of Seattle. Our Southern California markets have good demand, but are feeling some pressure on pricing. In our expansion markets, we continue to feel the impact of new supply as expected, but have been able to maintain occupancy at or above 95% given the strong demand in those markets. Overall, we continue to see improvements in the eviction process times as the court systems work through their backlogs and the number of long-standing delinquent residents continue to decline. This trend continues to support our view that we will see overall improvement in bad debt net contribute 30 basis points to our same-store revenue for the full-year. Given all of these trends, we have revised our full-year same-store revenue guidance midpoint to 3.2%, which includes an assumption of seasonal moderation in both new lease and renewals and a normal decline in occupancy later in the year. Now a little more color on the individual markets. Starting in Boston, the market is performing in line with our expectations, which assumed that it would be one of our best markets in 2024. Occupancy is holding strong amidst the highly seasonal summer leasing months as compared to past years when we often saw a declining occupancy as residents churned in and out more frequently. Overall, strong retention in the second quarter, along with continued new lease growth, has positioned us well as we finish the primary leasing season. We are seeing good performance in both our urban and suburban portfolios here, but the urban portfolio produced stronger results in the quarter. The market has a stable employment picture and little new competitive supply being delivered in 2024. New York continues to perform very well. We think this market probably has the best supply-demand dynamics in the country for the next couple of years. We're over 97% occupied, with both new leases and renewals coming in better than expected. Overall, the economy in New York feels healthy with a solid and increasingly diversified employment base. In fact, the private sector employment in New York is at an all-time high. All indications are that this market will continue to show strength through the remainder of the leasing season. Washington, D.C. continues to be a real standout performer for us in 2024. The market is over 97% occupied and showing great rental rate growth. Demand feels good across all of our submarkets, and we expect this to continue, but we will be keeping an eye on new supply deliveries in the back half of the year as we have felt isolated periods of pressure in the central D.C. submarket. In Los Angeles, a generally stable employment picture is leading to good demand in the market. Traffic and applications are up, and our second quarter occupancy, while slightly below where we wanted it to be, is up 70 basis points from the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, our new lease change was negatively impacted by some concentrated new supply in Hollywood Mid-Wilshire as well as some shadow supply coming into the market in downtown and West LA submarkets from evictions. Our suburban deals in Ventura and Santa Clarita, which did not experience this, are leading the pack. We are already seeing marked improvement to the new lease change in the third quarter, but we expect this stat to continue to be volatile as the market works through filling these units, which remains a catalyst to our revenue growth. Rounding out the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County are continuing to see good demand, but we are seeing some price sensitivity with residents willing to move further out in these markets for affordability reasons. Now for the markets that may be of most interest, San Francisco, Seattle and our expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Atlanta and Austin. San Francisco and Seattle continued to perform better than expected, with Seattle outperforming the most. Remember that we entered the year with relatively modest expectations and the potential for upside in both of these markets. In San Francisco, demand feels good right now, and we are seeing some of the best weeks in terms of traffic and application volume. We continue to see really positive signs in the downtown submarket in regards to the quality of life issues. Property crime is down, and the city's nightlife scene is thriving. Recent reports that Salesforce is pushing harder on return to office should have a positive impact on the city. Looking forward, there is little new supply coming to the market. Overall starts are way down, and there have been no new starts of competitive products for the last three quarters, which supports improving conditions for the next couple of years. As I mentioned earlier, Seattle is really showing signs of recovery. Occupancy is 96.2%. Our renewal performance remained strong. We're feeling good about both the quality of life issues in the market as well as tractions in places like South Lake Union from the return to office at companies like Amazon. The tech employment here looks solid as we see more postings for positions in both the city of Seattle and the Bellevue, Redmond area. And looking at our migration patterns, we are also seeing more people come to us from the farther out suburbs, which is an additional demand driver to our assets. Also, we expect our large concentration of properties in Central Seattle to benefit from a newly completed $800 million infrastructure project that better connects Downtown to the waterfront and created a spectacular new park for our residents to enjoy. We are excited to join in the effort to enhance Downtown Seattle with our newly completed $8 million improvement of the Staircase Plaza at our 761-unit Harbor Steps Apartments. Our steps and the associated new retail there are another way to connect the city down to the newly activated waterfront park. At this point, the Seattle market is positioned to do well, but there is supply coming later this year, and we need to see if the demand and pricing holds through the third quarter. Switching to the expansion markets. There's really no surprises here. We continue to see demand, but it's a challenging operating environment for both new leases and retention given the amount of new supply. Right now, the pressure on new leases makes renewing residents the number one priority in these markets. Overall, the expansion markets are performing in line with our expectations, with Dallas and Denver leading the way. Looking forward, we're excited to grow our portfolio and create operating scale in these markets that continue to demonstrate long-term demand from our target affluent renter demographic. And finally, on the innovation front. This past quarter, we began testing a new AI resident assistant that we anticipate could handle 75% of general resident inquiries, including the ability to help residents triage basic service requests and then automatically submit those that require a visit from our service members. In addition, we continue to see promising results with a self-guided tour experience app that increases tour availability to meet the needs of our prospects. We are very excited about these initiatives as they will continue to create future operating efficiencies, while providing a more seamless customer experience. I want to give a shout out to our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation, enhancing customer service and their exceptional disciplined approach to expense management. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Garechana: Thanks, Michael. Mark and Michael went over the drivers of our 70 basis point improvement in same-store revenue at the midpoint. So I'll focus on our revisions to same-store expense and NOI guidance, along with normalized FFO. Turning to same-store expenses. Expense management continues to be a core competency for the team. Our revision reflects this with a 100 basis point reduction at the midpoint, which is now below the low end of our prior range. This reduction reflects really solid year-to-date performance driven by three major categories: repairs and maintenance, payroll and utilities. These categories make up about half of our same-store expenses, and all three have growth that is either flat or negative year-to-date. While we expect growth to accelerate in the second half of this year given more challenging 2023 comparisons, we still anticipate delivering very low growth of around 3% for the full-year. This is yet again a reflection of the value in our platform from harnessing innovation, technology and efficiency to deliver outstanding results and attribute to our capable team. With these revenue expense and expense improvements, we are increasing our same-store NOI growth outlook and now expect same-store operating margin expansion for the full-year, something of a rarity in the apartment sector today. This NOI growth is the main driver of our $0.04 or 100 basis point improvement to NFFO growth reflected at the midpoint of our guidance. Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our revised NFFO guidance for your reference. One final note before I turn it over to the operator. This quarter, we enhanced our capital expenditure disclosure with the intent of providing stakeholders better insight into the value-enhancing CapEx activities we undertake. In 2024, these activities primarily consist of unit renovations, technology spend, and sustainability initiatives that are discretionary and provide positive return on investments through enhanced revenue growth, additional income or reduced expenses. These projects are often some of the best risk-adjusted returns we can make. With this new disclosure, we also believe that we are presenting our CapEx spend more in line with our industry peers. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. I was hoping you could go into greater detail on what you're expecting in terms of seasonality for the rest of the year. And I asked the question in part because it looks like you did of around 2.4% employment rate growth in the first half. You're guiding to 2.5% in the third quarter. So it feels like you're guiding to no deceleration in the fourth quarter, but just trying to understand if that's actually the case?\nMichael Manelis: Hey, Eric, this is Michael. And I guess I'll just start out. I'll give you a little bit of color. So first and foremost, I think specific to the third quarter, right now, we expect very stable kind of achieved renewal rate increases around 4.5% and slight seasonal moderation of new lease change. We do have a little bit of an easier comp in September from the declines that we saw last year. So it may hold up a little bit better than expected, but we didn't include kind of a lot of that in the initial forecast right now. Overall, for us, I think the key takeaway should be that we originally modeled kind of this full-year blended rates to be about 2%. And right now, we're expecting them to be closer to like the mid tubes. And a lot of that is going to depend on the mix of the renewals and new lease transactions, both in the third and fourth quarter. But if we just look at the snapshot today, I mean, the portfolio is over 96% occupied, our application volumes remain solid, and our net effective pricing trend curve is more in line with a normal year as compared to the slightly muted curve that we initially modeled. So I think right now, we feel like we're in a really good spot for July and all of our dashboards, all of these metrics just point to kind of normal seasonal deceleration curves both in the third quarter and fourth quarter.\nEric Wolfe: All right. That's helpful. And then as far as LA, you mentioned some of the pricing weakness you're seeing from evictions. So I was wondering when you would expect that impact to sort of make its way through the market? And what type of improvement you would expect to see once that happens?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I mean I think specific to LA, so first and foremost, right, we were focused on the occupancy build. We mentioned that on the last quarter call that we were doing some concessions. We were able to see a year-over-year lift in occupancy of about 70 basis points. And the new lease change in LA, it was less than what we anticipated by staying negative in the third quarter. And a lot of that was really based on the impact that we saw in new supply in some key submarkets of Hollywood Mid-Wilshire in Downtown. So I think when we think about the LA performance for us and like the recovery, clearly, we have upside built in for us. I still think for the balance of this year, we're going to continue to feel some of the pressure from the supply in those isolated submarkets. The start numbers are materially down, so that bodes well for future year performance. So in my mind, I think you should just expect as we continue to work through this year and get ourselves into next year for 2025, we're going to have some upside potential on the recovery. But we really like the total revenue story right now because we are filling these units with paying residents. So despite the new lease change stat that you kind of see being a little softer in the third quarter, the total revenue is still producing a pretty strong number for us.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks, good morning. Michael, could you maybe just speak a little bit more about the renewals? I know it was 5% in the quarter. How did that trend kind of April, May, June? And then where are you sending out renewal notices today for kind of the July, August and maybe September time frame? Thanks.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So first, I think the renewal performance through the quarter has been pretty stable for us right around that 5% mark. And I think as we look at the third quarter, like I said, we have a lot of confidence right now. We have quotes out in the marketplace for the next 90 days that range between like 6.5% and 7%. We're negotiating still a little bit more than norm, and we think this kind of slight bias towards occupancy, clearly, in some of like the expansion markets and even like the LA market that I just discussed, makes sense for us from a total revenue standpoint. So I think we expect, even as we work our way through the third quarter, pretty stable renewal performance results and we'll achieve somewhere right around that 4.5% mark.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe on the capital deployment front, either for Alex or Mark, you sort of -- it sounds like everything is somewhere in and around five caps. I guess, how are you thinking about IRR hurdles today? And has that really changed as kind of the stock price has gone up and bond pricing, bond yields have certainly come down. So I guess, are you changing your underwriting criteria at all from an IRR perspective?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Hey, Steve, it's Alex. And you're right, we're pricing things that are generally say, newer -- or new product in say an $80 million to $120 million price range, typically in the suburbs and what we've been buying has been our expansion mark that around a five cap. And when we filter in relatively -- some slightly negative rent growth in the first year, offset by some operating platform improvements, flat year two and then a recovery in year three, which may be 5% for the next couple of years. As you're into -- half of '27 and half of '28, you're getting to a number that's around an eight. And that's a deal that works for us and fits within our cost of capital.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks. Maybe just focusing on the expansion markets. I want to kind of hear your view on maybe the potential progression of new lease growth, marketing growth this fall. If you can even kind of compare it to kind of typical seasonality, obviously, more supply there. So I just wanted to know kind of how do you think the Sun Belt will play out this fall relative to typical seasonal patterns?\nMichael Manelis: Yes, Adam, this is Michael. So I think I would just start by saying, as we think about the new lease change performance in the expansion market. So far, there's nothing that's really surprised us. I mean what you're seeing today is that we have a lot of former residents moving out that never received a concession. We're averaging anywhere between like 35% to 50% of applications receiving about six weeks. That's what's driving some of that new lease change. And I think as we think about the balance of the year and the seasonality, the interesting thing about these markets is that, one, they definitely demonstrate a little less demand seasonality, meaning that they don't drop off in demand quite as much as some of the shoulder -- in the shoulder seasons as some of the coastal markets do. So I think we have this opportunity that we could just kind of stay in the zone that we've been in. But we expect challenging operating conditions in those markets for the balance of the year. You can look at the new supply that's coming in. You look at kind of how we're balancing the trade-offs between occupancy and rate. And I think we just expect that we're going to be in this place for the next couple of quarters. I don't necessarily forecast that we're going to see marked deceleration from this point forward. But I think we would clearly expect to have difficult operating conditions for the balance of the year.\nMark Parrell: And just to be fair, Adam, it's Mark. These are markets we don't have very large exposures. Meaning Denver now with 10 assets, that's a meaningful portfolio. But some of these markets, we're still building up our portfolio. So we're telling you what we see on the ground. It's certainly not maybe except as to Denver comprehensive. The portfolio will get larger. But I would say we ran in these markets until about 2015. We understand the impact of supply, and I think Michael's comments are generally applicable. But again, our knowledge on the ground is more for Denver and a little bit less for those other markets as we build the portfolio out.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. The other thing, I guess, I would just add besides the read through to a broader market is not our numbers is that a lot of the assets we own are brand new in the areas where a lot of the new supply is being built. So that's why we kind of say we expected those difficult operating conditions. But again, it's playing out kind of like we expected.\nMark Parrell: Yes. And we bought those assets knowing that. And really depending on less CapEx in the long run, a better resident base. I mean we had a lot of reasons we thought these assets even though they would face that supply. We're better than maybe owning deep suburban assets that add outdated physical plants and outdated unit layouts and just would require a lot more CapEx over time.\nAdam Kramer: Great. That's really helpful. And I thought the blended rate for established market disclosure that you guys added this quarter relative to the kind of whole portfolio. I thought that was really helpful in just kind of showing the impacts of these markets. Maybe just -- and sort of to be fixated on supply here, but I think you guys had some interesting color on kind of the Seattle supply cycle maybe hitting a little bit later this year. Just wondering kind of among the established markets. Is this the market that you kind of have -- you're watching most closely in terms of supply? Are there others that maybe have a similar cadence in terms of deliveries maybe later than later peak than the national peak in terms of deliveries?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Adam, this is Michael again. I really do believe that it is the Seattle market. Outside of the expansion markets that we just talked about, it's the Seattle market right now that we're going to have probably the most focused because it was back half loaded. There are a few more deals coming online in Redmond where we have a concentration of newer assets that will go head-to-head. And really, outside of that, when you look at this overall level of competitive supply pressure, which for us, we kind of defined by the proximity 1, 2-mile radiuses depending on the market. We have some isolated pockets like in the Korea town area and a little bit of Central D.C. that I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, where we know we're going to continue to feel some limited pressure from the supply. But outside of those areas, we really feel like we're in a good spot from a less pressure from the supply coming online in the balance of the year.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thank you so much for all the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJosh Dennerlein: Hey guys. Mark, just wanted to follow-up on a comment you had in your opening remarks on podding of the Dallas and Atlanta acquisitions. What kind of uplift do you expect from that podding effect versus that I think year 1 underwriting of, call it, 5%? And then does that podding effect assume additional properties in those clusters?\nMichael Manelis: Josh, this is Michael. So I'll just talk in general like about how we're approaching podding, which to us is really just sharing resources. Across assets today, we have about 65% of our properties that are already functioning with some level of shared resources. As we think about going into these expansion markets, clearly, we need the acquisitions to create those opportunities to create the density because the proximity of assets to each other really does facilitate the upside. And I think what you see is the benefits coming off of podding. Clearly, you see that show up in our payroll growth numbers, and that is what we would expect going forward in those expansion markets. But there's also opportunities in the service side of the business as we think about leveraging resources differently that take our dependency off of third-party contractors off. That kind of keeps that R&M number down as well.\nMark Parrell: And just to elaborate -- it's Mark on that. It depends on where the asset is. In some cases, we're buying assets that are a ways out from what we have in contemplation or own already. So if it's an asset that's nearby, for example, in Central Atlanta, we own assets in Midtown already. And so owning more of their shared services are an obvious play. We bought assets in the Northeast quadrant of the suburbs. That asset is a little further out. There isn't as much shared service opportunity there. So it's a little bit asset by asset as well.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe just stepping back, just how should we think about maybe the margin expansion opportunity across your portfolio in the years ahead?\nMark Parrell: So I'm going to start, and then Bob may elaborate on this. So a little bit right now with inflation tailing off, I really thought about margin expansion more in terms of just blunting the rate of inflation in our expenses. Right now, I think what technology is allowing us to do is really harvest expense savings and not sacrifice on the service side. Michael Manelis has spoken to this, we're really shifting more to our revenue focus. So I think you're going to see us talk more about ways that we can provide additional services to our residents or be more efficient on that revenue line as opposed to just simply continuing to screw down expenses. There will always be opportunities there. But I think we're getting to a point on expenses where there's probably more opportunity on the revenue line for a bit. I don't know, Bob, if there's anything you'd add on the margin side there?\nRobert Garechana: No. And clearly, obviously, the revenue opportunity helps the margin even more so than the expense side, right? So being able to drive that kind of top line revenue opportunity, coupled with expense discipline that we've demonstrated and continue to demonstrate, we think that we can deliver a margin that is approaching 70% or hopefully even better as we kind of layer in these innovation and this technology and just -- the team operates at maximum efficiency.\nMark Parrell: There's just a number of ideas that the group has that we're testing is the highest number we've ever seen. So just when you think about both expense and revenue opportunities, there's a lot of open experiments. And one of the great things about our platform is we can test it on three or four assets. If it works well for us and for our residents, we can roll out. And if it doesn't, well, that's fine, we'll go on to the next idea. So I think that's what's exciting about where we sit in our journey.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: Yes, thanks. Just to follow-up on the OpEx side there. So given all these initiatives, do you think we are back to a 2% to 3% expense growth range for the next couple of years?\nMark Parrell: Hey Tony, it's Mark. I'll start. Bob will correct me as usual. I think it's going to be hard to say that with property taxes being 45% of our expense load. We've got a little and we footnoted 421-A burn-off pressure there. So I think that number is easily going to be three-plus and close to four at times in the next couple of years. And so it's going to be a little bit difficult for us to push that number below three consistently, I would think, without seeing some other big innovation occur. We'll continue to challenge Mr. Manelis to do that. But I think the property tax part is pretty uncontrollable. I do see some opportunity in insurance. I hope we get some benefit there, especially if the hurricane season isn't too bad. We don't own in those markets, but it's all very much connected. So I don't know, Bob, if there's something you'd add on the expense side. But to me, the challenge would be property taxes are tough to manage.\nRobert Garechana: And we do have some -- like Mark mentioned, this year, we had some step-up in 421-A. We will continue to have some more step up. But I think what we can kind of endeavor or what we do endeavor to promise is depending on the context is if inflation is X, we endeavor to perform the best we can at X minus, right? And so that's what those initiatives will do, and we continue to pressure Michael to deliver.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thanks. And then just my second one, I know these are not big dollars for EQR. But I noticed that your advocacy costs are up a lot in the quarter versus, say, what you were spending in 2022 and even into 2023. So can you maybe just step back and give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the regulatory landscape and if anything has changed there? And perhaps whether some of the risk there has shifted to the federal level or if it's still just very much a local matter?\nMark Parrell: Yes. Thanks, Tony. There's a few things in that, so I'll try and go through it. But first, directly, when you have a year like this with the California ballot initiative, you're going to see a lot more spending. So this is going to be much more akin to 2018, 2020 levels of spend on our side when we fought and successfully fought off valid proposals with the rest of the industry on rent control in California. So I would expect that number to be $10 million or more this year, and that's what's sort of contemplated in the numbers. There's a Reg G sort of reconciliation towards the back, but that's in there and that's something we would expect. And a lot of that spend will occur in the third quarter in contemplation of course, of the election in November in California. So a lot of the regulatory effort right now for the industry and for our company is focused on California. It is something we've beaten off two prior occasions by more than 20 points. So voters, I think are very sophisticated in hearing the arguments against rent control. I think it's really interesting in California that the forces of anti-housing, the people who don't want a single unit of housing built in places like Orange County love this measure, know that rent control means less production of housing. And I think people in California see that. So we're optimistic we can, again, help educate the voters in California and win on this measure again. In terms of federal versus state, I think there's just more activity that's more relevant at the state level. State and local is where most of our focus is. We did think that the President's statement about rent control is not productive. We talk to a lot of people in the administration, and a lot of those conversations are much more constructive than that sort of directly political proposal that came out that we think isn't going anywhere, but it's not helpful. So I do think most of the effort here is on the state and local side. We certainly are working with the two candidates for President, trying to educate staffs and talk to them about the opportunity to encourage supply at the federal level. And that that's something constructive the federal government can do. And so that conversation is ongoing with both the Harris campaigns and the Trump campaigns. But that's a focus on the federal side more is educational. On the states, it's both electoral and educational.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful. Appreciate it.\nMark Parrell: Thanks, Tony.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. With the increase in the occupancy guidance, does that reflect stronger demand or an intent to lean more heavily into occupancy in the back half of the year? And related to that, can you talk about which markets maybe where you're seeing occupancy build versus those where you may be pushing rate? Thanks.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. Hey Michael, so first and foremost, I think recognizing the gains that we've seen in occupancy year-to-date is a lot of the driver to the increase because we are modeling for kind of normal seasonality to occur, which would allow that occupancy to start drifting back down probably towards the later part of Q3 and into Q4. So I think for us, right now, East Coast stands out, right? I've got all three of our established markets on the East Coast running 97% plus. I don't know that I would say that overall, I have a theme that we're biased towards occupancy. I think we're looking market and submarket. We're really focused on how do we maximize revenue. And in several of our markets and submarkets, we saw really good demand, which meant we were going to put our foot down on the gas with rate and see what we could achieve and hold back some of that occupancy. And in other markets like the expansion markets and even L.A., we had demand, but we saw this opportunity, and we know what conditions are going to be like kind of for the next quarter or so, and we thought we would lean towards the occupancy. So I think every market and submarket has a different kind of strategic approach to it. But overall, right now, I would say that the raise is more indicative of what we've seen so far with the ability to achieve outsized occupancy gains and just expect normal seasonal drop-offs to occur for the balance of the year.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks, and as a direct follow-up, you talked about kind of like the expectations for a normal seasonal back half of the year. So if you take the blended spread expectations, it looks like it -- you took it from two to maybe the mid-2% range and assuming a typical seasonal year, like should we be thinking about the earn-in as we sit today for 2025 is 1.25%. And within that, like what are the factors that could change that over the coming months?\nMark Parrell: Hey Michael, it's Mark. So we're not going to speculate about the earn-in yet. I think it's just too early to have that conversation.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. In that case, can I ask another question in that, right, like the NOI guidance grew by or moved higher by 145 basis points and the FFO guidance grew by 100 basis points. So can you just walk through some of the moving pieces in overhead and other that may have limited the flow through during the period?\nRobert Garechana: Yes, Michael, it's Bob. And I think there's a forward rec in the earnings release that can help you. But it is basically the main contribution to NOI growth offset in part by overhead growth that -- a good portion of that overhead growth is actually coming from property management and is related to legal costs associated with defense. Unfortunately, we do live in an environment where we are sometimes facing litigation -- regulation by litigation or attempts at regulation by litigation and our regular way kind of defense costs for various cases go through that property management line item, and we include those in normalized FFO. And so a good portion of the increase or the $0.02 production that you saw in that rec is associated with legal costs and the remaining is just kind of your regular way compensation accrual adjustments and the typical stuff you see in the second quarter. But that's basically getting you down to the -- reconciling you down to the $0.04 increase and the 100 basis points versus the 145 basis points difference.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half.\nRobert Garechana: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you. I was curious if you could provide your thoughts on the spread between renewal and new lease pricing being several 100 bps? How sustainable do you feel like that is? And do we think that that may return to a more normalized spread later this year or more of a next year change?\nMichael Manelis: Hey David, this is Michael. So we've looked at the data going all the way back in time between these spreads, and it's not uncommon for the spreads to be 300 to 400 basis points different from each other, clearly, looking at the second quarter. I do think you're going to see a little bit of tightening in that spread going forward. I think with a little bit of that moderation of the renewals, just based on kind of where pricing is today in the marketplace, you'll see a little bit of that compression. But I don't think they're going to be sitting right on top of each other because it's fairly normal for us to maintain a spread between those two stats.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. And I was curious if you could give the numbers for what the loss to lease was in 2Q? And where does that sit at this point in the summer?\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So I think first, let me just explain that. At the beginning of the year, our portfolio was in a moderate gain to lease position. We're about 60 basis points gain. And since then, we've seen that pricing trend sequentially tick up and follow kind of a more normal rent seasonality curve. And it's put us back into a loss-to-lease environment. As of the middle of July, our loss-to-lease in the portfolio was negative 3.6%. It's a little bit less than kind of what you would have saw in historical years, but a lot of that is just due to the expansion market pricing as well as kind of what we were seeing in the Los Angeles market. I do think it's important for everyone to remember that gain to lease, it's just a snapshot like point in time where you mark all leases in place to the market, and they don't directly translate into like a full-year revenue number growth. A lot of that has to do with the timing of who moves out. But again, I'm going to reiterate kind of what I said before, which is when I snapshot the portfolio sitting at the end of July today, we like the position we're at both from a pricing trend, from an occupancy, from an application volume. And even with the loss-to-lease at 36, we feel like we're in a really good spot for late July to deal with kind of the balance of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Amazing. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. Just going back to Los Angeles. I know you mentioned some supply impact, but I imagine there could be some demand impact as well from some of the disruption going on in Hollywood TV film industry. Can you just talk a little bit about any trends you are seeing in kind of exposure to that sector within the region?\nMichael Manelis: Yes, Nick, this is Michael. So I haven't seen anything right now in our numbers. For us, when we're looking at kind where the residents are coming to us from, the industries, I don't have an overly heavily concentrated kind of bucket that says I'm tied to like the studio activity. I think there's a lot of peripheral jobs that are all dependent upon that activity of the studios. But right now, the demand actually feels pretty good for us in L.A. What we're dealing with right now is that you have a lot of what I would say is the shadow supply occurring in the market, where units, not only in our own portfolio but in all the properties we compete against getting through the court system, getting through the eviction process. And that's really just bringing additional supply to the market. So you look at demand, you look at the fact that the occupancy is holding strong, 95.5%-plus. There's demand in the marketplace. It's just that you've got a lot more units coming into that market through this eviction process. And I think you just got to give it another couple of quarters for us to work through the absorption of those units.\nNicholas Yulico: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just -- one other question is on the transaction market. If you could talk a little bit more about maybe what you're seeing out there in terms of how buyers are underwriting assets in terms of rent growth for the next several years, how much that could be impacting like an initial sort of cap rate expectation?\nAlexander Brackenridge: Hey Nick, it's Alex. It really depends where you're underwriting that opportunity. In the expansion markets, as I said, most people are slightly negative and flat the first couple of years and then seeing a pop as supply goes away. In a more urban setting, say, in San Francisco, where there's still some recovery coming, it's a different underwrite, but probably starting at the same cap rate. There haven't been a whole lot of trades, but there are deals on the market right now, and my understanding is they're probably going to trade for a round of five. And that buyer is expecting better things coming. They're not seeing the supply issues, obviously, that we are in the expansion markets, but they're expecting that the city continues to improve and that rent growth is a little outsized for the next few years. So -- however you slice it, it does seem like the magic number is a five right now. And that number works well for us. We're going to be active both on the acquisitions and disposition side.\nNicholas Yulico: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. It looks like new lease rent softened a bit in June relative to May. I know it's only 20 basis points. But I was wondering if you can comment on rents peaking earlier than what you've seen historically. And also as part of that, do you expect new lease pricing in the third quarter to potentially be flat or negative?\nRobert Garechana: Hey John, it's Bob. I'll start with kind of the monthly commentary, and then I'll pass it off to Michael to give trends. And to be honest with you, while your inference is not incorrect based on the information you have, one of the challenges of producing these monthly numbers, particularly when they are interim numbers, which is where you would have gotten those or that inference for June is that they were interim and the final was different. So if you actually peel back the onion and looked at the quarter monthly-by-monthly, June was our best number on new lease and on blend. April and May were slightly lower, which is very typical and very normal. But it is -- it gets confusing when you're producing these monthly numbers that are preliminary that change over time, which is one of the reasons why we don't think it's helpful to provide that degree of disclosure when you're not in meaningful inflection points. So -- and that's why we're moving away from those. But to reiterate and answer specifically, June was actually the best month in terms of spreads on new lease and blend, and I'll pass it over to Michael on the outlook.\nMichael Manelis: Yes, so in terms of rent peaking, I guess I would tell you going all the way back in time from like 2005, we kind of understand the rent seasonality component. And rents typically would peak somewhere in that July to the second week of August time frame. For the last two years, we've seen what we've described as almost like a double peak, where rents peaked in June then they softened down a little bit and then they come back up in that August period. Right now, we're in a little bit of that kind of mix where we've decelerated a little bit in the last couple of weeks. But we've got good volume. We've got strong applications. So my guess is we'll see kind of that pricing trend line pick up a little bit. Regardless whether we pick up and have a double peak or not, I'll tell you, our rents today are up 7% from where they were at the beginning of January. That's about 40 basis points stronger than a normal rent seasonality curve and definitely stronger than kind of the muted expectations that we started the year. So I think we like the rent level position that we're at right now. Whether we get a little bit more acceleration for the next couple of weeks really doesn't impact kind of our full-year outlook.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And then if I could ask about turnover, it went up a little bit, but still relatively low compared to where it's been historically at 11.7%. But can you discuss any differences between your established and expansion markets on turnover?\nMichael Manelis: John, this is Michael. So turnover clearly in the expansion markets is higher right now than the established markets. The renewal process, the residents have a lot of choices in the market. We're working really hard to do it, but the percent of residents renewing is more like in the mid- to high-40s, not the 55% to 60% that we see across the established markets. And I guess I would look at that overall turnover number and even in those established markets, I tell you, it's still pretty low. Right? And you could see that kind of versus all of our historical trends right now that we are at kind of historical lows for turnover across all of these markets. And that's just -- it's a good position for us to be in right now.\nJohn Kim: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJames Feldman: Great, thank you. I guess sticking with the turnover topic, I mean, are there any markets where you're actually seeing an inflection point of turnover rising? And similarly, any markets where you can flag price sensitivity more than others or an inflection point in price sensitivity more than others. Kind of tying into some of the comments INVH made on their call that there are some markets where they're seeing a change.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. I mean, I think I said in my prepared remarks, we saw in Southern California, clearly in the Orange County and San Diego just a little bit of a willingness to move further out for a lower price point. You could see that in the reasons for move-out kind of showing up in those markets. The overall numbers, though, when you look at the move-out reasons, our increase is too expensive, which is one of those areas that residents could denote when they're moving out. Actually, it was about 16% of our move-outs. And that actually ticked up a little bit from the first quarter, but remained well below what our historical norms were for that stat, which was more like 20%. And that really just continues to support this notion that our residents remain in really good financial shape and aren't really kind of feeling that immediate pressure. But as I said in the prepared remarks, I did -- this last quarter, we saw a little bit of that in Southern California kind of play out and it's something we're just going to continue to watch. But the overall rent to income ratios in the portfolio for new residents coming in is right at 20%, which continues to support this notion that they're in good financial shape.\nJames Feldman: Okay. Thanks for that. And I appreciate your comments on the political environment. But I guess just sticking with D.C. specifically, and it sounds like either way, we're going to have a change in administration. Just historically, how does that market tend to trend around a Presidential election around a change in administration just in terms of demand? And what should we expect to see on the occupancy side?\nMichael Manelis: Ins and outs and very stable, actually. We've looked at this, trying to see if the actual administration completely change out what happens. Right now, we can't see anything in the data to suggest that there's a material impact to our overall demand drivers there.\nJames Feldman: So you think it's pretty smooth, just through '25? Barring just normal...\nMichael Manelis: Yes, I think it's just stable.\nMark Parrell: I think the federal government is a bit of a monolith. Keeps going.\nJames Feldman: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike, I was hoping you can provide a little bit more color on the West Coast portfolio. What you're seeing concession-wise across L.A., San Fran and Seattle. And what's your expectations are for blended rate growth for those markets in the second half versus the mid-2% portfolio? Thanks.\nMichael Manelis: Yes. So first, concessions for us in the portfolio do remain concentrated in the West Coast, and it's really Downtown San Francisco, the City of Seattle and Los Angeles. And for us right now, the volume of concessions in those markets it's really ranging about 15% in Los Angeles, just receiving under a month and in Seattle and San Francisco were more like 30% to 40% right around a month in those Downtown areas. So I think for us, we expect that the concessions are going to be stable here for the next couple of months. And then we do anticipate a little bit of an acceleration in the back half of the third quarter and in through the fourth quarter. And that's just kind of looking at what we've seen from a demand seasonality standpoint, where our expectations are. Our overall concession use did come in a little better than we expected. It was 25% lower sequentially from the first quarter and about 7.5% lower than the second quarter of '23. In terms of like the stats as to how to think about the third quarter there, we do have a little bit of an easier comp coming at us in Seattle and San Francisco. So my guess is the new lease stack could hold up a little bit better. Not a lot of impact on the renewals. We expect the stability there. And I think in Los Angeles, I don't anticipate a material change because like I said, the pockets that were feeling supply pressure, we don't anticipate that abating. And I think we're going to continue to work through some of the excess inventory from the eviction process, and that's going to take us through the year. So I just don't have a specific number I would give you for the quarter. I just think we've got different scenarios playing out across those markets.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And Mark, maybe one for you. I guess I'm curious if any of the assets you bought here. In early third quarter, Atlanta and Dallas were from Lennar as they monetized their Quarterra [ph] portfolio. And I'm curious on your view overall of the portfolio trade that they had with KKR. It seems like a lot of that portfolio could fit your wheelhouse, newer assets, some coastal, some Sun Belt exposure. So I'm curious if you took a run at it? And any interest in the remaining assets that they may not have sold yet? Thanks.\nAlexander Brackenridge: Hi, Haendel, it's Alex. Yes, we did take a look at that portfolio. And no, we didn't end up with any of those assets. We were interested in a subset of the assets that KKR ended up taking down. So they included things that KKR wanted that we didn't want, frankly. So unfortunately, of, say, the 38 assets, there were about nine that were a good fit for us, and that wasn't a big enough chunk for us to prevail relative to KKR as a much bigger offer.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Okay. So the ones here in early third quarter had nothing to do with Lennar. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning out there. Thanks. And Mark, hopefully, that apartment education extends to Albany here in New York, definitely could use it. So two questions here. The first is, in the second quarter, you guys took a sizable, I guess, it's called commercial dispute and construction defects charge. So maybe if you could just walk a little bit more through that and maybe just a little background and if there are any other projects that could fitness or this is just something that had been growing for a while and finally came to fruition?\nRobert Garechana: Hey, Alex, it's Bob. So we did take a charge that you can see on Page 27, it's about $9 million. A portion of it was from a commercial dispute, which was basically a dispute related to a brown lease. So a very unique bespoke situation that is not recurring in any regard. So that was a portion of it. And unrelated to that, on a separate asset, there was a construction defect that was identified at a property, and we took a reserve around that construction defect. We are pursuing the parties involved in the construction of the assets. So there is an opportunity in the future to potentially recover some of that. This isn't that uncommon to have these kind of small construction defect issues where you have a situation and then a few quarters later, sometimes years later, you recover that amount from the insurance company of the contractor or a builder or from them themselves. So -- but it's nothing systemic or nothing that is recurring in nature. There's just two unique situations.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, as you guys look at the landscape and everyone sort of has the same playbook, right? Supply is plummeting. Late '25 to early '28 is going to be these great years for multifamily. Given your degree of existing assets, are you guys thinking more about buying more existing assets to benefit as presumably rents really improve during this time period? Or your view is you'd rather invest more in joint developments, whether it's presales or JV developments, what have you, in getting more into development activity to have product that may come up and deliver sometime during this period? Just trying to figure out what you guys view as more advantageous, to buy existing assets or to invest in development, given what looks to be a healthy two to three years that are coming after the supply wave currently delivers.\nMark Parrell: Alex, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. We're open to buying existing streams of income or open to developing assets. We'll do either, and we're doing both. But right now, our lean is towards the existing assets. We think there's still going to be quite a bit sold. You saw the comment I made about transaction volumes going up, a lot of nonnatural owners, just people that are developers that are in assets with shorter-term bank debt that we think are going to sell. And may not quite be at the fire sale price as people expected a couple of years ago, but there's still going to be good values compared to replacement cost, and we like that basis. There may be a play on development later. You may see more opportunities there. You've got construction cost issues. You've got execution issues all across the industry still. And you've got funding issues. I think development in a REIT is just very challenging at scale because you either have to prefund yourself and carry that cash to the detriment of shareholders or you have to go naked and hope that at the time you need the money, the capital markets are hospitable and you're able to raise it in an accretive fashion. So we like development. We like it up to a limit. And that limit usually is about what our free cash flow is, which is about $250 million a year. Because then we can sort of self-fund it and not worry too much about the external capital markets. So right now, again, the lean is towards the existing assets.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nMark Parrell: Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mark Parrell for any additional and closing remarks.\nMark Parrell: Well, thank you all for your time and interest on the call today. We appreciate it. Good day.\nOperator: This does conclude today's -- everyone else has left the call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our second quarter 2024 operating performance as well as provide some highlights of our increased same-store operating guidance. As you saw in our release, our overall operating fundamentals remain healthy, driven by good demand across our portfolio and a strong renewal process that resulted in low resident turnover and strong occupancy of 96.4% for the quarter. As Mark mentioned, we are benefiting from what we see as a solid job picture across the country keeping our residents well employed with growing wages as well as very little competitive new supply in our established markets. The rent-to-income ratio on new move-ins during the quarter remained stable at around 20%. Not surprisingly, we are also benefiting from a very low percent of our residents moving out to buy homes. About 7.5% of our move-outs gave bought home as the reason. This is the lowest number we have seen in any given quarter. That, along with the benefits of our centralized renewal process, has made our year-to-date results on renewals, both in terms of the volume of residents renewing and the achieved renewal rate increases, a key driver to our outperformance. As has been the case for a while now, our East Coast markets are the best performers with occupancies around 97%. On the West Coast, Seattle is performing particularly well, and San Francisco is showing improvement but not quite at the pace of Seattle. Our Southern California markets have good demand, but are feeling some pressure on pricing. In our expansion markets, we continue to feel the impact of new supply as expected, but have been able to maintain occupancy at or above 95% given the strong demand in those markets. Overall, we continue to see improvements in the eviction process times as the court systems work through their backlogs and the number of long-standing delinquent residents continue to decline. This trend continues to support our view that we will see overall improvement in bad debt net contribute 30 basis points to our same-store revenue for the full-year. Given all of these trends, we have revised our full-year same-store revenue guidance midpoint to 3.2%, which includes an assumption of seasonal moderation in both new lease and renewals and a normal decline in occupancy later in the year. Now a little more color on the individual markets. Starting in Boston, the market is performing in line with our expectations, which assumed that it would be one of our best markets in 2024. Occupancy is holding strong amidst the highly seasonal summer leasing months as compared to past years when we often saw a declining occupancy as residents churned in and out more frequently. Overall, strong retention in the second quarter, along with continued new lease growth, has positioned us well as we finish the primary leasing season. We are seeing good performance in both our urban and suburban portfolios here, but the urban portfolio produced stronger results in the quarter. The market has a stable employment picture and little new competitive supply being delivered in 2024. New York continues to perform very well. We think this market probably has the best supply-demand dynamics in the country for the next couple of years. We're over 97% occupied, with both new leases and renewals coming in better than expected. Overall, the economy in New York feels healthy with a solid and increasingly diversified employment base. In fact, the private sector employment in New York is at an all-time high. All indications are that this market will continue to show strength through the remainder of the leasing season. Washington, D.C. continues to be a real standout performer for us in 2024. The market is over 97% occupied and showing great rental rate growth. Demand feels good across all of our submarkets, and we expect this to continue, but we will be keeping an eye on new supply deliveries in the back half of the year as we have felt isolated periods of pressure in the central D.C. submarket. In Los Angeles, a generally stable employment picture is leading to good demand in the market. Traffic and applications are up, and our second quarter occupancy, while slightly below where we wanted it to be, is up 70 basis points from the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, our new lease change was negatively impacted by some concentrated new supply in Hollywood Mid-Wilshire as well as some shadow supply coming into the market in downtown and West LA submarkets from evictions. Our suburban deals in Ventura and Santa Clarita, which did not experience this, are leading the pack. We are already seeing marked improvement to the new lease change in the third quarter, but we expect this stat to continue to be volatile as the market works through filling these units, which remains a catalyst to our revenue growth. Rounding out the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County are continuing to see good demand, but we are seeing some price sensitivity with residents willing to move further out in these markets for affordability reasons. Now for the markets that may be of most interest, San Francisco, Seattle and our expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Atlanta and Austin. San Francisco and Seattle continued to perform better than expected, with Seattle outperforming the most. Remember that we entered the year with relatively modest expectations and the potential for upside in both of these markets. In San Francisco, demand feels good right now, and we are seeing some of the best weeks in terms of traffic and application volume. We continue to see really positive signs in the downtown submarket in regards to the quality of life issues. Property crime is down, and the city's nightlife scene is thriving. Recent reports that Salesforce is pushing harder on return to office should have a positive impact on the city. Looking forward, there is little new supply coming to the market. Overall starts are way down, and there have been no new starts of competitive products for the last three quarters, which supports improving conditions for the next couple of years. As I mentioned earlier, Seattle is really showing signs of recovery. Occupancy is 96.2%. Our renewal performance remained strong. We're feeling good about both the quality of life issues in the market as well as tractions in places like South Lake Union from the return to office at companies like Amazon. The tech employment here looks solid as we see more postings for positions in both the city of Seattle and the Bellevue, Redmond area. And looking at our migration patterns, we are also seeing more people come to us from the farther out suburbs, which is an additional demand driver to our assets. Also, we expect our large concentration of properties in Central Seattle to benefit from a newly completed $800 million infrastructure project that better connects Downtown to the waterfront and created a spectacular new park for our residents to enjoy. We are excited to join in the effort to enhance Downtown Seattle with our newly completed $8 million improvement of the Staircase Plaza at our 761-unit Harbor Steps Apartments. Our steps and the associated new retail there are another way to connect the city down to the newly activated waterfront park. At this point, the Seattle market is positioned to do well, but there is supply coming later this year, and we need to see if the demand and pricing holds through the third quarter. Switching to the expansion markets. There's really no surprises here. We continue to see demand, but it's a challenging operating environment for both new leases and retention given the amount of new supply. Right now, the pressure on new leases makes renewing residents the number one priority in these markets. Overall, the expansion markets are performing in line with our expectations, with Dallas and Denver leading the way. Looking forward, we're excited to grow our portfolio and create operating scale in these markets that continue to demonstrate long-term demand from our target affluent renter demographic. And finally, on the innovation front. This past quarter, we began testing a new AI resident assistant that we anticipate could handle 75% of general resident inquiries, including the ability to help residents triage basic service requests and then automatically submit those that require a visit from our service members. In addition, we continue to see promising results with a self-guided tour experience app that increases tour availability to meet the needs of our prospects. We are very excited about these initiatives as they will continue to create future operating efficiencies, while providing a more seamless customer experience. I want to give a shout out to our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation, enhancing customer service and their exceptional disciplined approach to expense management. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Hey, Eric, this is Michael. And I guess I'll just start out. I'll give you a little bit of color. So first and foremost, I think specific to the third quarter, right now, we expect very stable kind of achieved renewal rate increases around 4.5% and slight seasonal moderation of new lease change. We do have a little bit of an easier comp in September from the declines that we saw last year. So it may hold up a little bit better than expected, but we didn't include kind of a lot of that in the initial forecast right now. Overall, for us, I think the key takeaway should be that we originally modeled kind of this full-year blended rates to be about 2%. And right now, we're expecting them to be closer to like the mid tubes. And a lot of that is going to depend on the mix of the renewals and new lease transactions, both in the third and fourth quarter. But if we just look at the snapshot today, I mean, the portfolio is over 96% occupied, our application volumes remain solid, and our net effective pricing trend curve is more in line with a normal year as compared to the slightly muted curve that we initially modeled. So I think right now, we feel like we're in a really good spot for July and all of our dashboards, all of these metrics just point to kind of normal seasonal deceleration curves both in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Yes. I mean I think specific to LA, so first and foremost, right, we were focused on the occupancy build. We mentioned that on the last quarter call that we were doing some concessions. We were able to see a year-over-year lift in occupancy of about 70 basis points. And the new lease change in LA, it was less than what we anticipated by staying negative in the third quarter. And a lot of that was really based on the impact that we saw in new supply in some key submarkets of Hollywood Mid-Wilshire in Downtown. So I think when we think about the LA performance for us and like the recovery, clearly, we have upside built in for us. I still think for the balance of this year, we're going to continue to feel some of the pressure from the supply in those isolated submarkets. The start numbers are materially down, so that bodes well for future year performance. So in my mind, I think you should just expect as we continue to work through this year and get ourselves into next year for 2025, we're going to have some upside potential on the recovery. But we really like the total revenue story right now because we are filling these units with paying residents. So despite the new lease change stat that you kind of see being a little softer in the third quarter, the total revenue is still producing a pretty strong number for us. Yes. So first, I think the renewal performance through the quarter has been pretty stable for us right around that 5% mark. And I think as we look at the third quarter, like I said, we have a lot of confidence right now. We have quotes out in the marketplace for the next 90 days that range between like 6.5% and 7%. We're negotiating still a little bit more than norm, and we think this kind of slight bias towards occupancy, clearly, in some of like the expansion markets and even like the LA market that I just discussed, makes sense for us from a total revenue standpoint. So I think we expect, even as we work our way through the third quarter, pretty stable renewal performance results and we'll achieve somewhere right around that 4.5% mark. Yes, Adam, this is Michael. So I think I would just start by saying, as we think about the new lease change performance in the expansion market. So far, there's nothing that's really surprised us. I mean what you're seeing today is that we have a lot of former residents moving out that never received a concession. We're averaging anywhere between like 35% to 50% of applications receiving about six weeks. That's what's driving some of that new lease change. And I think as we think about the balance of the year and the seasonality, the interesting thing about these markets is that, one, they definitely demonstrate a little less demand seasonality, meaning that they don't drop off in demand quite as much as some of the shoulder -- in the shoulder seasons as some of the coastal markets do. So I think we have this opportunity that we could just kind of stay in the zone that we've been in. But we expect challenging operating conditions in those markets for the balance of the year. You can look at the new supply that's coming in. You look at kind of how we're balancing the trade-offs between occupancy and rate. And I think we just expect that we're going to be in this place for the next couple of quarters. I don't necessarily forecast that we're going to see marked deceleration from this point forward. But I think we would clearly expect to have difficult operating conditions for the balance of the year. Yes. The other thing, I guess, I would just add besides the read through to a broader market is not our numbers is that a lot of the assets we own are brand new in the areas where a lot of the new supply is being built. So that's why we kind of say we expected those difficult operating conditions. But again, it's playing out kind of like we expected. Yes. Adam, this is Michael again. I really do believe that it is the Seattle market. Outside of the expansion markets that we just talked about, it's the Seattle market right now that we're going to have probably the most focused because it was back half loaded. There are a few more deals coming online in Redmond where we have a concentration of newer assets that will go head-to-head. And really, outside of that, when you look at this overall level of competitive supply pressure, which for us, we kind of defined by the proximity 1, 2-mile radiuses depending on the market. We have some isolated pockets like in the Korea town area and a little bit of Central D.C. that I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, where we know we're going to continue to feel some limited pressure from the supply. But outside of those areas, we really feel like we're in a good spot from a less pressure from the supply coming online in the balance of the year. Josh, this is Michael. So I'll just talk in general like about how we're approaching podding, which to us is really just sharing resources. Across assets today, we have about 65% of our properties that are already functioning with some level of shared resources. As we think about going into these expansion markets, clearly, we need the acquisitions to create those opportunities to create the density because the proximity of assets to each other really does facilitate the upside. And I think what you see is the benefits coming off of podding. Clearly, you see that show up in our payroll growth numbers, and that is what we would expect going forward in those expansion markets. But there's also opportunities in the service side of the business as we think about leveraging resources differently that take our dependency off of third-party contractors off. That kind of keeps that R&M number down as well. Yes. Hey Michael, so first and foremost, I think recognizing the gains that we've seen in occupancy year-to-date is a lot of the driver to the increase because we are modeling for kind of normal seasonality to occur, which would allow that occupancy to start drifting back down probably towards the later part of Q3 and into Q4. So I think for us, right now, East Coast stands out, right? I've got all three of our established markets on the East Coast running 97% plus. I don't know that I would say that overall, I have a theme that we're biased towards occupancy. I think we're looking market and submarket. We're really focused on how do we maximize revenue. And in several of our markets and submarkets, we saw really good demand, which meant we were going to put our foot down on the gas with rate and see what we could achieve and hold back some of that occupancy. And in other markets like the expansion markets and even L.A., we had demand, but we saw this opportunity, and we know what conditions are going to be like kind of for the next quarter or so, and we thought we would lean towards the occupancy. So I think every market and submarket has a different kind of strategic approach to it. But overall, right now, I would say that the raise is more indicative of what we've seen so far with the ability to achieve outsized occupancy gains and just expect normal seasonal drop-offs to occur for the balance of the year. Hey David, this is Michael. So we've looked at the data going all the way back in time between these spreads, and it's not uncommon for the spreads to be 300 to 400 basis points different from each other, clearly, looking at the second quarter. I do think you're going to see a little bit of tightening in that spread going forward. I think with a little bit of that moderation of the renewals, just based on kind of where pricing is today in the marketplace, you'll see a little bit of that compression. But I don't think they're going to be sitting right on top of each other because it's fairly normal for us to maintain a spread between those two stats. Yes. So I think first, let me just explain that. At the beginning of the year, our portfolio was in a moderate gain to lease position. We're about 60 basis points gain. And since then, we've seen that pricing trend sequentially tick up and follow kind of a more normal rent seasonality curve. And it's put us back into a loss-to-lease environment. As of the middle of July, our loss-to-lease in the portfolio was negative 3.6%. It's a little bit less than kind of what you would have saw in historical years, but a lot of that is just due to the expansion market pricing as well as kind of what we were seeing in the Los Angeles market. I do think it's important for everyone to remember that gain to lease, it's just a snapshot like point in time where you mark all leases in place to the market, and they don't directly translate into like a full-year revenue number growth. A lot of that has to do with the timing of who moves out. But again, I'm going to reiterate kind of what I said before, which is when I snapshot the portfolio sitting at the end of July today, we like the position we're at both from a pricing trend, from an occupancy, from an application volume. And even with the loss-to-lease at 36, we feel like we're in a really good spot for late July to deal with kind of the balance of the year. Yes, Nick, this is Michael. So I haven't seen anything right now in our numbers. For us, when we're looking at kind where the residents are coming to us from, the industries, I don't have an overly heavily concentrated kind of bucket that says I'm tied to like the studio activity. I think there's a lot of peripheral jobs that are all dependent upon that activity of the studios. But right now, the demand actually feels pretty good for us in L.A. What we're dealing with right now is that you have a lot of what I would say is the shadow supply occurring in the market, where units, not only in our own portfolio but in all the properties we compete against getting through the court system, getting through the eviction process. And that's really just bringing additional supply to the market. So you look at demand, you look at the fact that the occupancy is holding strong, 95.5%-plus. There's demand in the marketplace. It's just that you've got a lot more units coming into that market through this eviction process. And I think you just got to give it another couple of quarters for us to work through the absorption of those units. Yes, so in terms of rent peaking, I guess I would tell you going all the way back in time from like 2005, we kind of understand the rent seasonality component. And rents typically would peak somewhere in that July to the second week of August time frame. For the last two years, we've seen what we've described as almost like a double peak, where rents peaked in June then they softened down a little bit and then they come back up in that August period. Right now, we're in a little bit of that kind of mix where we've decelerated a little bit in the last couple of weeks. But we've got good volume. We've got strong applications. So my guess is we'll see kind of that pricing trend line pick up a little bit. Regardless whether we pick up and have a double peak or not, I'll tell you, our rents today are up 7% from where they were at the beginning of January. That's about 40 basis points stronger than a normal rent seasonality curve and definitely stronger than kind of the muted expectations that we started the year. So I think we like the rent level position that we're at right now. Whether we get a little bit more acceleration for the next couple of weeks really doesn't impact kind of our full-year outlook. John, this is Michael. So turnover clearly in the expansion markets is higher right now than the established markets. The renewal process, the residents have a lot of choices in the market. We're working really hard to do it, but the percent of residents renewing is more like in the mid- to high-40s, not the 55% to 60% that we see across the established markets. And I guess I would look at that overall turnover number and even in those established markets, I tell you, it's still pretty low. Right? And you could see that kind of versus all of our historical trends right now that we are at kind of historical lows for turnover across all of these markets. And that's just -- it's a good position for us to be in right now. Yes. I mean, I think I said in my prepared remarks, we saw in Southern California, clearly in the Orange County and San Diego just a little bit of a willingness to move further out for a lower price point. You could see that in the reasons for move-out kind of showing up in those markets. The overall numbers, though, when you look at the move-out reasons, our increase is too expensive, which is one of those areas that residents could denote when they're moving out. Actually, it was about 16% of our move-outs. And that actually ticked up a little bit from the first quarter, but remained well below what our historical norms were for that stat, which was more like 20%. And that really just continues to support this notion that our residents remain in really good financial shape and aren't really kind of feeling that immediate pressure. But as I said in the prepared remarks, I did -- this last quarter, we saw a little bit of that in Southern California kind of play out and it's something we're just going to continue to watch. But the overall rent to income ratios in the portfolio for new residents coming in is right at 20%, which continues to support this notion that they're in good financial shape. Ins and outs and very stable, actually. We've looked at this, trying to see if the actual administration completely change out what happens. Right now, we can't see anything in the data to suggest that there's a material impact to our overall demand drivers there. Yes, I think it's just stable. Yes. So first, concessions for us in the portfolio do remain concentrated in the West Coast, and it's really Downtown San Francisco, the City of Seattle and Los Angeles. And for us right now, the volume of concessions in those markets it's really ranging about 15% in Los Angeles, just receiving under a month and in Seattle and San Francisco were more like 30% to 40% right around a month in those Downtown areas. So I think for us, we expect that the concessions are going to be stable here for the next couple of months. And then we do anticipate a little bit of an acceleration in the back half of the third quarter and in through the fourth quarter. And that's just kind of looking at what we've seen from a demand seasonality standpoint, where our expectations are. Our overall concession use did come in a little better than we expected. It was 25% lower sequentially from the first quarter and about 7.5% lower than the second quarter of '23. In terms of like the stats as to how to think about the third quarter there, we do have a little bit of an easier comp coming at us in Seattle and San Francisco. So my guess is the new lease stack could hold up a little bit better. Not a lot of impact on the renewals. We expect the stability there. And I think in Los Angeles, I don't anticipate a material change because like I said, the pockets that were feeling supply pressure, we don't anticipate that abating. And I think we're going to continue to work through some of the excess inventory from the eviction process, and that's going to take us through the year. So I just don't have a specific number I would give you for the quarter. I just think we've got different scenarios playing out across those markets."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I will start us off, and then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will discuss our second quarter 2024 revenue results and outlook as well as give some recent highlights from what we call our property operations innovation machine. And then Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our expense results and updated normalized funds from operations guidance, and then we'll take your questions. Looking at our quarterly results. Same-store revenues increased 2.9%, and same-store expenses rose only 2.7%, which led to same-store NOI growth of 3% and an increase in our NFFO per share of 3.2%. So far this year, our revenue performance has exceeded expectations as steady demand across all of our markets has met limited supply in our coastal established markets. As a reminder, approximately 94% of our NOI comes from our coastal established markets. Michael will get into the details shortly, but the Northeastern markets of Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. as well as Seattle are standouts relative to our expectations back in January. Our expansion markets of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver, which together constitutes 6% of our NOI, continue to have good demand, but remain under pressure from continuing high levels of supply with our Atlanta and Austin portfolios most impacted. Putting all of this in a blender, this led us to increase our same-store revenue guidance by 70 basis points at the midpoint to 3.2%. Underlying these positive results and outlook are several trends that continue to support rental housing performance, including high homeownership costs, limited for-sale inventory and a steady though moderating employment picture. We continue to see high levels of retention among our residents due to elevated homeownership costs, with homeownership processing record levels last month, making rental housing a good value alternative. We also see a steady employment picture in our target higher-earning renter demographic leading to sustained good levels of demand. In the second quarter, we saw a continuation of total employment growth across nearly all of our markets. Drilling down the office using employment, we saw a return to positive growth in Q2 for the first time in several quarters, with strong numbers posted by Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Atlanta. And, of course, lifestyle factors like delayed marriage and childbearing, which we've talked about on prior calls, continue to be a positive factor. The expense side of the equation is similarly positive news as we continue to utilize our sector-leading innovation machine to drive improvements in both our cost structure and our resident service experience. We lowered the same-store expense midpoint of our annual guidance by a full percentage point to 3%, leading to a new same-store NOI guidance midpoint of 3.25% for the year, which is 145 basis points better than our prior midpoint. My appreciation to all my outstanding on-site and corporate colleagues, their hard work and dedication to our customers and to supporting each other. Switching to capital allocation. We're seeing more transaction activity as the interest rate climate stabilizes and sellers and buyers cap rate expectations coalesce around 5%. Transaction volumes in our markets in the second quarter of 2024 was almost triple what it was in the first quarter and double what it was in the second quarter of 2023. As you saw in our release, during the second quarter, we acquired one property in suburban Boston. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired a property in Atlanta and one in Dallas. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here to answer your specific questions in a moment. But generally speaking, we are buying recently built properties in our expansion markets at a basis that compares well to replacement cost and underwriting a 5% forward cap rate with our pro forma assuming further degradation of rents, but also assuming the benefits in year one of our more focused delinquency and vacancy management processes. In year two, as we get the acquired properties fully integrated into our superior operating platform, we are assuming that we can pod the acquired properties with our other nearby properties as we obtain scale in these markets and efficiently share employees across properties as we do in our coastal established markets. While we acknowledge that current rent levels are weak in these expansion markets and likely to remain so in the near-term. In the longer-term, we see relief on the way that starts in these oversupplied markets have collapsed and deliveries in 2026 and in 2027 are likely to be much lower than both current levels and historical levels. These expected lower supply levels underpin our property acquisition underwriting in outer years where we expect a significant rental rate recovery. We are excited to acquire these properties at a basis that we see as highly favorable and add properties with strong cash flow growth prospects once supply levels normalize in a few years. The entire Equity team also looks forward to demonstrating our core competencies of smartly acquiring and efficiently integrating new acquisitions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. And just to be fair, Adam, it's Mark. These are markets we don't have very large exposures. Meaning Denver now with 10 assets, that's a meaningful portfolio. But some of these markets, we're still building up our portfolio. So we're telling you what we see on the ground. It's certainly not maybe except as to Denver comprehensive. The portfolio will get larger. But I would say we ran in these markets until about 2015. We understand the impact of supply, and I think Michael's comments are generally applicable. But again, our knowledge on the ground is more for Denver and a little bit less for those other markets as we build the portfolio out. Yes. And we bought those assets knowing that. And really depending on less CapEx in the long run, a better resident base. I mean we had a lot of reasons we thought these assets even though they would face that supply. We're better than maybe owning deep suburban assets that add outdated physical plants and outdated unit layouts and just would require a lot more CapEx over time. And just to elaborate -- it's Mark on that. It depends on where the asset is. In some cases, we're buying assets that are a ways out from what we have in contemplation or own already. So if it's an asset that's nearby, for example, in Central Atlanta, we own assets in Midtown already. And so owning more of their shared services are an obvious play. We bought assets in the Northeast quadrant of the suburbs. That asset is a little further out. There isn't as much shared service opportunity there. So it's a little bit asset by asset as well. So I'm going to start, and then Bob may elaborate on this. So a little bit right now with inflation tailing off, I really thought about margin expansion more in terms of just blunting the rate of inflation in our expenses. Right now, I think what technology is allowing us to do is really harvest expense savings and not sacrifice on the service side. Michael Manelis has spoken to this, we're really shifting more to our revenue focus. So I think you're going to see us talk more about ways that we can provide additional services to our residents or be more efficient on that revenue line as opposed to just simply continuing to screw down expenses. There will always be opportunities there. But I think we're getting to a point on expenses where there's probably more opportunity on the revenue line for a bit. I don't know, Bob, if there's anything you'd add on the margin side there? There's just a number of ideas that the group has that we're testing is the highest number we've ever seen. So just when you think about both expense and revenue opportunities, there's a lot of open experiments. And one of the great things about our platform is we can test it on three or four assets. If it works well for us and for our residents, we can roll out. And if it doesn't, well, that's fine, we'll go on to the next idea. So I think that's what's exciting about where we sit in our journey. Hey Tony, it's Mark. I'll start. Bob will correct me as usual. I think it's going to be hard to say that with property taxes being 45% of our expense load. We've got a little and we footnoted 421-A burn-off pressure there. So I think that number is easily going to be three-plus and close to four at times in the next couple of years. And so it's going to be a little bit difficult for us to push that number below three consistently, I would think, without seeing some other big innovation occur. We'll continue to challenge Mr. Manelis to do that. But I think the property tax part is pretty uncontrollable. I do see some opportunity in insurance. I hope we get some benefit there, especially if the hurricane season isn't too bad. We don't own in those markets, but it's all very much connected. So I don't know, Bob, if there's something you'd add on the expense side. But to me, the challenge would be property taxes are tough to manage. Yes. Thanks, Tony. There's a few things in that, so I'll try and go through it. But first, directly, when you have a year like this with the California ballot initiative, you're going to see a lot more spending. So this is going to be much more akin to 2018, 2020 levels of spend on our side when we fought and successfully fought off valid proposals with the rest of the industry on rent control in California. So I would expect that number to be $10 million or more this year, and that's what's sort of contemplated in the numbers. There's a Reg G sort of reconciliation towards the back, but that's in there and that's something we would expect. And a lot of that spend will occur in the third quarter in contemplation of course, of the election in November in California. So a lot of the regulatory effort right now for the industry and for our company is focused on California. It is something we've beaten off two prior occasions by more than 20 points. So voters, I think are very sophisticated in hearing the arguments against rent control. I think it's really interesting in California that the forces of anti-housing, the people who don't want a single unit of housing built in places like Orange County love this measure, know that rent control means less production of housing. And I think people in California see that. So we're optimistic we can, again, help educate the voters in California and win on this measure again. In terms of federal versus state, I think there's just more activity that's more relevant at the state level. State and local is where most of our focus is. We did think that the President's statement about rent control is not productive. We talk to a lot of people in the administration, and a lot of those conversations are much more constructive than that sort of directly political proposal that came out that we think isn't going anywhere, but it's not helpful. So I do think most of the effort here is on the state and local side. We certainly are working with the two candidates for President, trying to educate staffs and talk to them about the opportunity to encourage supply at the federal level. And that that's something constructive the federal government can do. And so that conversation is ongoing with both the Harris campaigns and the Trump campaigns. But that's a focus on the federal side more is educational. On the states, it's both electoral and educational. Thanks, Tony. Hey Michael, it's Mark. So we're not going to speculate about the earn-in yet. I think it's just too early to have that conversation. I think the federal government is a bit of a monolith. Keeps going. Alex, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. We're open to buying existing streams of income or open to developing assets. We'll do either, and we're doing both. But right now, our lean is towards the existing assets. We think there's still going to be quite a bit sold. You saw the comment I made about transaction volumes going up, a lot of nonnatural owners, just people that are developers that are in assets with shorter-term bank debt that we think are going to sell. And may not quite be at the fire sale price as people expected a couple of years ago, but there's still going to be good values compared to replacement cost, and we like that basis. There may be a play on development later. You may see more opportunities there. You've got construction cost issues. You've got execution issues all across the industry still. And you've got funding issues. I think development in a REIT is just very challenging at scale because you either have to prefund yourself and carry that cash to the detriment of shareholders or you have to go naked and hope that at the time you need the money, the capital markets are hospitable and you're able to raise it in an accretive fashion. So we like development. We like it up to a limit. And that limit usually is about what our free cash flow is, which is about $250 million a year. Because then we can sort of self-fund it and not worry too much about the external capital markets. So right now, again, the lean is towards the existing assets. Thank you. Well, thank you all for your time and interest on the call today. We appreciate it. Good day."

            "name": "Robert Garechana",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Mark and Michael went over the drivers of our 70 basis point improvement in same-store revenue at the midpoint. So I'll focus on our revisions to same-store expense and NOI guidance, along with normalized FFO. Turning to same-store expenses. Expense management continues to be a core competency for the team. Our revision reflects this with a 100 basis point reduction at the midpoint, which is now below the low end of our prior range. This reduction reflects really solid year-to-date performance driven by three major categories: repairs and maintenance, payroll and utilities. These categories make up about half of our same-store expenses, and all three have growth that is either flat or negative year-to-date. While we expect growth to accelerate in the second half of this year given more challenging 2023 comparisons, we still anticipate delivering very low growth of around 3% for the full-year. This is yet again a reflection of the value in our platform from harnessing innovation, technology and efficiency to deliver outstanding results and attribute to our capable team. With these revenue expense and expense improvements, we are increasing our same-store NOI growth outlook and now expect same-store operating margin expansion for the full-year, something of a rarity in the apartment sector today. This NOI growth is the main driver of our $0.04 or 100 basis point improvement to NFFO growth reflected at the midpoint of our guidance. Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our revised NFFO guidance for your reference. One final note before I turn it over to the operator. This quarter, we enhanced our capital expenditure disclosure with the intent of providing stakeholders better insight into the value-enhancing CapEx activities we undertake. In 2024, these activities primarily consist of unit renovations, technology spend, and sustainability initiatives that are discretionary and provide positive return on investments through enhanced revenue growth, additional income or reduced expenses. These projects are often some of the best risk-adjusted returns we can make. With this new disclosure, we also believe that we are presenting our CapEx spend more in line with our industry peers. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator. No. And clearly, obviously, the revenue opportunity helps the margin even more so than the expense side, right? So being able to drive that kind of top line revenue opportunity, coupled with expense discipline that we've demonstrated and continue to demonstrate, we think that we can deliver a margin that is approaching 70% or hopefully even better as we kind of layer in these innovation and this technology and just -- the team operates at maximum efficiency. And we do have some -- like Mark mentioned, this year, we had some step-up in 421-A. We will continue to have some more step up. But I think what we can kind of endeavor or what we do endeavor to promise is depending on the context is if inflation is X, we endeavor to perform the best we can at X minus, right? And so that's what those initiatives will do, and we continue to pressure Michael to deliver. Yes, Michael, it's Bob. And I think there's a forward rec in the earnings release that can help you. But it is basically the main contribution to NOI growth offset in part by overhead growth that -- a good portion of that overhead growth is actually coming from property management and is related to legal costs associated with defense. Unfortunately, we do live in an environment where we are sometimes facing litigation -- regulation by litigation or attempts at regulation by litigation and our regular way kind of defense costs for various cases go through that property management line item, and we include those in normalized FFO. And so a good portion of the increase or the $0.02 production that you saw in that rec is associated with legal costs and the remaining is just kind of your regular way compensation accrual adjustments and the typical stuff you see in the second quarter. But that's basically getting you down to the -- reconciling you down to the $0.04 increase and the 100 basis points versus the 145 basis points difference. Thank you. Hey John, it's Bob. I'll start with kind of the monthly commentary, and then I'll pass it off to Michael to give trends. And to be honest with you, while your inference is not incorrect based on the information you have, one of the challenges of producing these monthly numbers, particularly when they are interim numbers, which is where you would have gotten those or that inference for June is that they were interim and the final was different. So if you actually peel back the onion and looked at the quarter monthly-by-monthly, June was our best number on new lease and on blend. April and May were slightly lower, which is very typical and very normal. But it is -- it gets confusing when you're producing these monthly numbers that are preliminary that change over time, which is one of the reasons why we don't think it's helpful to provide that degree of disclosure when you're not in meaningful inflection points. So -- and that's why we're moving away from those. But to reiterate and answer specifically, June was actually the best month in terms of spreads on new lease and blend, and I'll pass it over to Michael on the outlook. Hey, Alex, it's Bob. So we did take a charge that you can see on Page 27, it's about $9 million. A portion of it was from a commercial dispute, which was basically a dispute related to a brown lease. So a very unique bespoke situation that is not recurring in any regard. So that was a portion of it. And unrelated to that, on a separate asset, there was a construction defect that was identified at a property, and we took a reserve around that construction defect. We are pursuing the parties involved in the construction of the assets. So there is an opportunity in the future to potentially recover some of that. This isn't that uncommon to have these kind of small construction defect issues where you have a situation and then a few quarters later, sometimes years later, you recover that amount from the insurance company of the contractor or a builder or from them themselves. So -- but it's nothing systemic or nothing that is recurring in nature. There's just two unique situations."

            "name": "Alexander Brackenridge",
            "content": "Hey, Steve, it's Alex. And you're right, we're pricing things that are generally say, newer -- or new product in say an $80 million to $120 million price range, typically in the suburbs and what we've been buying has been our expansion mark that around a five cap. And when we filter in relatively -- some slightly negative rent growth in the first year, offset by some operating platform improvements, flat year two and then a recovery in year three, which may be 5% for the next couple of years. As you're into -- half of '27 and half of '28, you're getting to a number that's around an eight. And that's a deal that works for us and fits within our cost of capital. Hey Nick, it's Alex. It really depends where you're underwriting that opportunity. In the expansion markets, as I said, most people are slightly negative and flat the first couple of years and then seeing a pop as supply goes away. In a more urban setting, say, in San Francisco, where there's still some recovery coming, it's a different underwrite, but probably starting at the same cap rate. There haven't been a whole lot of trades, but there are deals on the market right now, and my understanding is they're probably going to trade for a round of five. And that buyer is expecting better things coming. They're not seeing the supply issues, obviously, that we are in the expansion markets, but they're expecting that the city continues to improve and that rent growth is a little outsized for the next few years. So -- however you slice it, it does seem like the magic number is a five right now. And that number works well for us. We're going to be active both on the acquisitions and disposition side. Hi, Haendel, it's Alex. Yes, we did take a look at that portfolio. And no, we didn't end up with any of those assets. We were interested in a subset of the assets that KKR ended up taking down. So they included things that KKR wanted that we didn't want, frankly. So unfortunately, of, say, the 38 assets, there were about nine that were a good fit for us, and that wasn't a big enough chunk for us to prevail relative to KKR as a much bigger offer."

Today's conference is being recorded. \n At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. \nMarty McKenna: Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2024 results. \n Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, are here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. \n Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. \n Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. \nMark Parrell: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2024 results and outlook for the year. \n I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance and how we see 2024 operations playing out. And then we will take your questions. \n We are pleased with our first quarter performance, which was ahead of January expectations and reflects the strong demand for the lifestyle our well-located apartment properties provide as well as little new competitive supply across most of our established markets. Our same-store revenues increased 4.1% in the quarter, and our same-store expenses rose only 1.3%, which led to same-store NOI growth of 5.5% and an increase in our NFFO per share of 6.9%. \n So overall, a very solid start to the year across all categories, with the company well positioned to capture increasing seasonal demand as we head into our prime leasing season. As is our practice, we have not revised our operating or FFO guidance, and we'll make adjustments as we get deeper into our primary leasing season. \n Digging under the hood a bit, the durability of the employment picture for our target affluent renter demographic is a continuing bright spot in our business as is the cost of owned housing. Unemployment for the college educated, a very sizable percentage of our residents, remains at around 2%, considerably lower than the overall average, supporting demand. This demographic, which is well employed in the growth engines of our economy, including technology, financial services and other professional and business services, continues to grow in both our established and expansion markets. \n We also see a little competition from owned housing as the high cost of homes, combined with elevated financing costs and rapidly rising insurance, real estate tax and maintenance costs combine to make rental housing a very attractive option for many people. Social factors that we've discussed on prior calls like smaller households and delayed marriage and childbearing add to the attractiveness of rental housing. \n In the quarter just ended, the percentage of our residents leaving us to buy homes was 7.8%, a continuation of all-time lows. Strong demand and high single-family housing costs are consistent conditions across both our coastal established markets that represent 95% of our company's NOI and our new expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Denver and Austin, that collectively represent 5% of our NOI. \n But on the apartment supply side, we see 2 very different pictures playing out in our established coastal markets versus our expansion markets. With the exception of Seattle and Central D.C. in our established coastal markets, we see the terrific demand I just mentioned being met with generally little new supply, leading to solid rent growth. Across our 4 expansion markets, we see robust demand as well, but it is being met by an overwhelming wave of new supply, leading to declining rent levels, high concessions and occupancy pressure. We expect this pressure to accelerate as units continue to deliver in these oversupplied markets, especially once the prime leasing season concludes and demand seasonally declines. \n Switching to expenses, Michael is going to go over all that with you in a moment. But I wanted to take a second to thank our teams across the company for their amazing work on expense management. We are very pleased to have produced a sector-leading 3.1% average growth rate of same-store expenses over the last 5 years. Our teams have embraced innovation and a customer service mindset and are not afraid of change, and it shows in these numbers. Well done, team. \n On the investment side, we are seeing properties that we would be interested in acquiring, well-located newer properties in our expansion markets in the suburbs of Seattle and Boston trade at high prices and in very low volume compared to pre-pandemic levels. Investment sales activity in the first quarter was over 60% below average pre-pandemic levels. Estimates from my colleagues who attended the recent ULI conference indicate that there is over $200 billion of dry powder looking to invest in North American real estate, with a significant portion focused on apartments. Recent data points from the pending AIRC transaction and apartment portfolio and one-off deals are similarly supportive of much higher values than the public market is currently suggesting. \n While this is a huge positive signal about the underlying value of our company, it has slowed our portfolio rebalancing efforts. And while pricing in most of the apartment transaction market is strong, buyer interest is not yet fully evident for some of the large urban West Coast assets that we want to dispose of as part of our strategic rebalancing. We expect that to change as these submarkets continue to show improved operations and better quality of life conditions. \n In the meantime, with the lack of actionable acquisition opportunities, we saw value in our own stock. So we continue to strategically deploy disposition proceeds from the sale of older inferior properties in our portfolio into repurchases of our stock. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $38.5 million of our own common shares at a weighted average share price of about $59 per share. Since we began this activity in the fourth quarter of 2023, we have repurchased approximately $87.5 million of our shares in what we see as an attractive valuation level of a bit below $58 per share. We are using the remaining disposition dollars to drive down our already low leverage, which will create more internal debt dry powder for when opportunities do emerge. We are going to continue to be disciplined in our transaction activities with a focus on growing cash flow over the long term.  \n With regard to external growth, we are on track to deliver 6 newly completed joint venture developments in 2024. These 6 properties, 3 located in Dallas-Fort Worth, 2 located in Denver and 1 located in suburban New York, will be delivered at a weighted average stabilized yield north of 6% and will contribute meaningfully to our normalized FFO starting in 2025 given their completion and lease-up timing. The 3 Dallas-Fort Worth developments are the first completed projects to come out of our partnership with Toll Brothers. With some of the other equity residential executives, I recently visited all 6 of these development projects, and I'm inspired by the enthusiasm on display from our lease-up teams and excited about adding these high-quality assets to our portfolio. \n Before I turn it over to Michael, I wanted to make a quick comment on the new housing laws that were passed over the weekend in New York, though I know we are still digesting the law and its implications. The law allows for renewal increases of CPI plus 5% up to 10%, and provides for vacancy decontrol on the types of units we generally own in New York, which allows rents to move to market when a new resident moves in, and that's similar to the rent laws that were passed a few years ago in California. \n Overall, new price controls on an already undersupplied good, in this case, rental housing, is not an effective way to attract private capital to help solve the housing supply problem in New York State. However, there are also tax incentives in the new law for new rental construction subject to a new higher wage scale required for labor on larger buildings as well as permanent affordability rules. There are also some language on zoning reforms and some rules that aim to make office-to-residential conversions easier. \n While the rent control provisions are not helpful, we commend the governor and the legislature for focusing on a supply-based solution similar to recent legislation passed in such politically disparate states as Florida and California. We think focusing on supply, not heavy-handed regulation, has been recognized on both sides of the aisle as the long-term solution. While the new law adds to the complexity of operating in New York, a good portion of our portfolio in New York City is exempt either due to being built during or after 2009 or meeting the luxury exemption thresholds. We'll be happy to discuss all this further in Q&A. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. \nMichael Manelis: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. \n This morning, I will review our first quarter 2024 operating performance and our positioning as we start the leasing season. \n We're off to a very good start thus far. As Mark mentioned, demand remains good across all of our markets, supported by a continuing solid job market and high employment in our affluent renter target demographic. One of the real highlights of the quarter was our turnover, which is the lowest we have ever seen. Our focus on customer satisfaction, harnessing data and leveraging our centralized renewal team to drive results is definitely having an impact here. \n In the first quarter, we renewed more than 61% of our residents, which is one of the highest percentages that we have seen. A special shout-out to New York, Boston and Seattle, who set their own high marks and greatly contributed to this result. \n Our first quarter same-store revenue growth exceeded our original expectations, including very good performance in San Francisco and Seattle, which I will discuss in a moment. This positions us very well for the year, but we acknowledge that this is just the beginning of a critical primary leasing season. Our efforts to build occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2023, coupled with continued strong demand and high resident retention, have resulted in both slightly above average rent growth since the beginning of the year and a 50-basis point quarterly sequential gain in physical occupancy. At 96.5% occupied this month, which is one of our highest reported occupancies in April, we have a lot of confidence that we will be able to continue to grow rates through the leasing season. The high percentage of residents renewing that I previously mentioned is also a big factor in this strength. \n In terms of market same-store revenue growth, the East Coast markets in Southern California are producing leading growth, as we expected, with San Francisco, Seattle and the expansion markets following in that order. As we think about these markets' performance relative to our expectations, New York and Washington, D.C. are running ahead of expectations, while Boston and Southern California and the expansion markets are in line. San Francisco and Seattle are also running ahead, but remember, these markets have been historically volatile. So we remain cautiously optimistic that we will hold on to the gains in these markets for the remainder of the year. \n Now a little more color on the individual markets before closing out with expenses and commentary in other income and initiatives. Starting in Boston, year-to-date revenue performance is in line with the expectations. City of Boston is currently 97% occupied and we have very little competitive supply to deal with. Concession use is little to none in this market. And overall, we continue to expect Boston to deliver some of the best full year revenue growth in the portfolio. \n As I mentioned, New York is performing well, with both strong demand and pricing power. The market is over 97% occupied and has very little competitive new supply. So far, we seem to have moved past the rent fatigue we saw in the market in late 2023 and expect good things from this market in '24. \n Hats off to Washington, D.C. as this market is outperforming our revenue growth expectations even after a strong 2023. We're benefiting from a very solid employment picture here, particularly in the defense sector which is driving consistent, stable high occupancy and real strength in our retention. We see good results across the whole market, but The District has recently begun lagging our suburban assets, likely due to nearby supply. Overall, we still expect Washington, D.C. to deliver a good amount of new supply in 2024 with nearly 13,000 competitive units. So we do anticipate the pressure to continue to grow as the year progresses. \n In Los Angeles, we see good demand, but not a lot of pricing power at the moment due to the additional units being brought back to the market through the eviction process. Our portfolio is 96% occupied, and we continue to make progress on the delinquency and bad debt situation, which should be a tailwind for growth in 2024. Time frames for processing evictions have recently improved from 9 months to 6 months, which should help us make more progress going forward. But they still do remain nearly twice as long as they used to be. That being said, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement. \n Rounding out the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County are continuing to be very strong performers. The general lack of housing is keeping occupancies high. Home ownership costs are also high here, which makes renting in these markets the more attractive option. San Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year, with limited pressure at a few of our Irvine locations. \n Now for the markets that may be of most interest: San Francisco, Seattle and the expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Atlanta and Austin. For the 2 West Coast markets, remember that we entered the year with relatively modest expectations but potential for upside. So far both markets are doing better than we expected, but it's early and both remain show-me stories as we saw periods of stability and pullback in 2023. \n In San Francisco, we are well occupied but would like to see continued improvements in pricing power. The South Bay, East Bay and Peninsula continue to perform better than our Downtown portfolio. The situation here remains the same as the market lacks the catalysts, either job growth or more robust return-to-office policies, to create true pricing power. Concessions remain prevalent in the Downtown submarket, but are being issued at a lower rate than they were in the fourth quarter, consistent with what you would seasonally expect. \n In Seattle, we carried strength from December into the early part of the year, leading to improved occupancy and the ability to move up rental rates, which is evident in our new lease growth for the quarter. That being said, we do expect a fair amount of competitive new supply in the market in 2024, which could temper growth. The East Side is performing better than the City of Seattle, and our Redmond assets are performing very well despite having some direct pressure from a new lease-up. Overall, the downtowns of both markets are showing real improvement in the quality of life, and the local political situation continues to get much more constructive as a focus on bringing these cities back to the thriving environments they were prior to the pandemic remains front and center with both policymakers and citizens. Recent primary elections in San Francisco were very encouraging as voters supported candidates who are focused on addressing safety and the quality-of-life challenges. \n Finally, some commentary on our expansion markets. Strong demand and a favorable regulatory environment continue to confirm our positive long-term outlook for these markets. Unfortunately, however, in the near term, we are seeing the pressures from high levels of new supply being delivered in 2024. Market occupancies are lower than our established markets and concessions are prevalent. So far, concession usage at stabilized asset properties in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver are running at about 30% of applicants getting about 4 to 6 weeks. And in Austin, it's 60% of applicants getting about 6 weeks. Operating conditions are challenging across all of these markets, but Dallas appears to be more resilient, followed by Denver, Atlanta and then Austin. The job growth numbers in both Austin and Dallas are some of the highest in the country, which is clearly aiding in the absorption of some of the new supply. But the volume of deliveries is high and going to continue to grow throughout the year. \n With regards to bad debt and delinquency, the first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As I mentioned, we continue to see improvements in the time it is taking to process evictions in L.A., which is where the majority of our delinquent residents are, which is resulting in a decrease in the number of long-standing delinquent residents that we have. This is an encouraging sign and continues to support our view that we will see overall improvement in bad debt net contribute 30 basis points to our same-store revenue for the full year. \n Now let me hit on some highlights on expenses. Our 1.3% growth in the quarter was better than expected and driven by a decrease in both utilities and repairs and maintenance, coupled with pretty flat on-site payroll expense growth. On the utility expense, we primarily benefited from lower commodity pricing. We also intend to take advantage of federal and local incentive programs to continue to accelerate our sustainability efforts and moderate future utility growth. For example, we have 26 future solar installations planned, in addition to our 55 active systems, which will help reduce our future overall assumption. \n Our repairs and maintenance expense decrease was driven primarily by lower turnover costs and, to a lesser degree, maintenance expense, which was unusually elevated in the prior year. Once again, our disciplined approach to expense management has continued to pay off. On the innovation front, as we have previously discussed, we will be focused on a number of initiatives to drive both revenue growth and operating efficiencies. \n Specific to other income, our expectation remains unchanged that this will be a contributor of 30 basis points to our full year same-store revenue growth. During the quarter, we delivered 60 basis points, which was slightly ahead of our original expectations and mostly due to faster implementation of our parking revenue optimization program. \n In addition to our efforts around other income, we have been very focused on areas of opportunity like leveraging artificial intelligence into our business process. As early adopters of these AI interactions, we are thrilled with the performance of these tools. Over the past year, our AI leasing assistant, Ella, has engaged with just over 600,000 customer inquiries, set 2 million responses addressing prospect questions, and booked over 80,000 appointments. Leveraging this type of automation at the top of our demand funnel has been incredibly effective, allowing us to be nimble with increasing initial traffic demand without impacting our remaining on-site employees' ability to provide high-touch customer interactions when needed. We're excited to share that in the coming quarter we will begin testing an AI resident assistant, helping existing residents 24/7 with common questions about their community service and even their account statements. \n I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation and enhancing customer service. As we sit here today, we're 96.5% occupied and continue to see strength in our renewal process, which positions us very well to capture the pricing power opportunities that the peak leasing season will bring. \n With that, I turn it over to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Wolfe with Citi. \nEric Wolfe: If I look at your April new lease growth of 0.1% versus the 1.6% at this time last year, I'm just trying to understand why it's a bit lower given you're in a better occupancy position. I think you said record retention, record low turnover. So just wondering if we could see that catch up over the next couple of months. \nMichael Manelis: Eric, this is Michael. So yes, I think one of the things you need to remember is that, relative to the first quarter in 2023, we are issuing more concessions right now. So that does impact a little bit of what you see in that new lease change. But clearly, when you just think about the normal rent seasonality curve, pricing trend or asking rents in the marketplace, we're seeing that sequentially build. And you're seeing that sequential improvement in kind of the new lease stats for April over March. So I think what you should expect for the next several months working our way probably even through the middle of the third quarter is that we will sequentially build new lease change up, and we will see that stability in kind of the renewal, achieved renewal increase performance. So you're right to call out that it's a little lower than norm, but right now we like the sequential improvement that we're seeing. \nEric Wolfe: All right. That's helpful. And then to your point on concessions, if we look at SF and Seattle, specifically, can you maybe talk about where concession usage is today versus, say, this time last year and if you're planning to dial that back further as we get into the peak leasing season? \nMichael Manelis: Yes. And I think I called this out even on the first -- or the call in January, that we made a strategic decision to increase the concession use, build up that occupancy in the fourth quarter, and really have been just pulling back the concession use as we worked our way through the first quarter. The most pronounced reduction actually came out of San Francisco. I think the offset to that reduction is that we also started to utilize some concessions in LA. So when you think about the sequential change from the fourth quarter through the first quarter, our concession use ticked down a little bit but not as much as what it would have been if we didn't start increasing some of the usage in the L.A. market.\n Right now, about 50% of the concessions that we're using are concentrated in Seattle and San Francisco, with a large majority of those sitting in those downtown areas. Both of those markets are below where they were in January. And I'll tell you, we've had a really strong couple of leasing weeks. So I know the teams right now for the last several weeks have been strategically looking at where they can continue to dial back the concession use. \nOperator: And our next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street. \nJohn Pawlowski: First question is on CapEx, Bob. It's been running, I think, last year about 3,700 unit, up to 3,800 this year, which is 40% higher than 2022. Is this a new structurally higher level of CapEx we should expect moving forward? Or should we expect a reversion to historical levels in the coming years? \nAlexander Brackenridge: John, it's Alex. So there are a couple of factors at play there. One is -- and we talked a little bit about this last quarter, is leaning in more on some ROI projects, specifically renovations, some solar installations, some smart rent installations as well, and EV chargers. So there's some things that we can toggle up and down. They have ROIs on them, and they're discretionary. So that's in the mix. \n There's also an element of catch-up from the pandemic. Those are projects that we just couldn't get to because we didn't want to disrupt our residents who were staying at home at that time. And so there's a little bit of catch-up there. So we're going to have a couple of more years of that, we think. So I think this 3,800-ish number is pretty good. \nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then a question on markets. I mean, Michael or Mark, I guess, which markets when you're looking at just in terms of the absolute level of rents are you more concerned you're getting closer to hitting the affordability ceiling? \nMichael Manelis: Yes, John, this is Michael. So really, from the affordability standpoint, I wouldn't say we have any concerns at all. I mean we're not seeing a material shift. We still sit at about 20% rent-to-income ratios. And the range is fairly tight, running between like 18.5% to 24%. And the Southern California markets are sitting up at that higher range and they really historically have always been up at that level. \n So I'm not concerned about us hitting that point where the affordability index. I think what we saw in a market like New York where you had such robust rent growth through the peak leasing season last year, you hit that point where kind of you felt like you hit a rent fatigue level. We're not seeing any of that right now in the portfolio, but it's still pretty early into the leasing season. So I'm more looking at that absolute rent level than anything around the affordability of our resident base. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. \nSteve Sakwa: Michael, I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more commentary on the San Francisco and Seattle sort of strengths, and whether you can determine are those kind of folks that are returning to the market? Are they just kind of moving around the Bay Area and Seattle? Just how do we think about that demand that's picked up in the drop in concessions? \nMichael Manelis: Yes. It's a great question. So this is Michael. So I look at those markets right now and I think, clearly, we did see some marginal improvement with the migration patterns. We're still running with a slightly higher percent of new residents coming to us from within the MSA, meaning we're just trading around within the MSA. But we are marginally seeing some improvement, but we are elevated still from those historical norms. And I think we're going to remain elevated until you see the catalyst of either job growth or specific to like Downtown San Francisco really seeing kind of a more robust return-to-office policy. \n So in terms of the demand, it's not really like the migration factors that are doing it. I still think you see some folks coming from further out near or in, and that was a little bit of the catalyst that we saw. And you also get a different sense of vibrancy. I mean we talked about this now for over a year. Every quarter, the cities, those metro areas seem to start feeling better and better. And you're seeing that play out. \n So right now, our positioning -- we've got both markets sitting up at 96% occupied. It gives us a lot of confidence to keep pressuring whether we're raising the absolute rate, holding back the concession, we're seeing the sequential build in our net effective rent. And that's what we're looking for. As long as the velocity holds, we're going to do really well through the peak leasing season. But we've seen these markets before kind of have fits and starts. So I think it's just too early to call that these are wins for the year. \nMark Parrell: Yes, I'm just going to elaborate. It's Mark, Steve, I'd add a little bit. Again, we do see that improvement in Downtown San Francisco, but it's not yet the job growth we probably need to drive rents. But we're 14% or so below rent levels that we're pre-pandemic. So there's definitely room here. Incomes have gone up, as we've talked about on the calls. \n The crime statistics in the city of San Francisco generally have really improved compared to last year and compared to pre-pandemic levels. And as Michael said, politically, we think the March 2024 primary was a real watershed moment. We think the citizens really took it upon themselves on both public safety and other matters to really take back their city. So we're excited about some of the progress there. \n The AI revolution is a big driver potentially for San Francisco, the city and the Bay Area more widely. Our numbers indicate that the Bay Area is getting 13x more funding than the next metro area in terms of AI investment. Now that's very significant. \n Now those jobs aren't that many yet. I mean they are a few hundred. They're not the thousands. So we're not seeing that job growth yet that we really need to drive our numbers. But we are seeing that network effect where companies like OpenAI was incubated at UC Berkeley and it opted to stay in San Francisco. Some of these incubator firms have moved back in to San Francisco from the city, from the suburbs. So that's all really positive. \n In Seattle, I just want to give a plug for our friends in the Northwest, I mean this enormous $700 million project, their version of the Big Dig, to take the Alaskan Way highway and put it underground and really activate the waterfront is really significant. It's driving tourism, it's driving activation slowly but surely in Downtown Seattle. \n Seattle's problem is really going to be the supply issues. There's just a fair bit of supply. But we do see activity levels improving. And again, politically, the city council and the mayor are much more focused in Seattle on public safety and quality of life because that's what their constituents have told them to be focused on. \n So again, we're pretty excited. And I guess we'd make the statement that we continue to see Seattle and San Francisco as when, not if, stories. And the when could be this year if things continue as they are, but we need to see a little few more months of continued good results in a market that, again, can give you a head fake once in a while. \nSteve Sakwa: Great. Maybe the second question, I don't know if Mark or Bob, you want to take this, on the -- I guess it was on the late fee California settlement and the charge that you guys took in the quarter. Can you just kind of elaborate or say what you can say about that? And does this kind of put this issue to bed? Or could there still be lingering kind of issues that come out of that lawsuit? \nMark Parrell: Steve, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. I mean we are still in active litigation, as you suggested in your comment or your question. So there's not a lot I can say. Just to give you a little background, this has been a case that's been going on for 10 years. About the amount of late fees, we just got a ruling from a judge that was adverse to our interest, so we adjusted the reserve. We are considering our appeal options. So to your point about adjustments, they could go up or down depending on our actions. \n Also the judge didn't give us a number. He gave us a methodology, and we're working out with claimant's council what that means. So we can charge late fees, it's just the amount that's an issue. So we need to figure that out. So there could certainly be additional adjustments. I wouldn't expect them to be terribly significant upward. But if we win an appeal, I guess there could be a downward adjustment. But this is going to go on for a little while yet, I would think. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. \nJoshua Dennerlein: I appreciate all the comments on San Francisco and Seattle, definitely a hot topic. Could you just remind us your split between urban and suburban exposure in those markets? \nAlexander Brackenridge: Yes. Josh, it's Alex. In Seattle, we're 60% urban and 40% suburban. In San Francisco, it's the opposite of that. So we have a broader suburban exposure there. \nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Cool. I appreciate that. And then I guess just are the trends like really materially different between the urban and suburban assets in those markets? And just trying to figure out like the dichotomy going forward. \nMichael Manelis: Yes. Josh, this is Michael. Yes, they're absolutely different. And again, this remains the story about kind of the City of Seattle and Downtown San Francisco is where we see kind of the least amount of pricing power, kind of lower occupancy. So the suburban portfolios are clearly outperforming the urban, and that's a trend we've seen for a while in those markets. \n The only thing I would call out in San Francisco is that you do have some supply coming back to the South Bay and it is back-half loaded. So you do need to see kind of that demand pick up because you have like 4,000 units coming back to that submarket just later on this year. But again, it's doing -- it's performing very well right now. We saw it absorb 4,000 units a couple of years ago. So it's nothing that we're concerned, but it's still something that we're watching for. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. \nDerrick Metzler: This is Derrick Metzler on for Adam Kramer. I wonder if you could tell us anything about the cadence of same-store growth for the rest of the year and kind of what to expect given the strong 1Q and full year guidance that's kind of well below that? \nRobert Garechana: Yes. Thanks, Derrick. It's Bob. I'll take that. Let me start because there's a few pieces driving this, but let me start on the same-store revenue front with the residential rental component. Our assumption for residential rental income is that we anticipate a year that is pretty normal, meaning that sequentially, we expect the blended rates to continue to get better until they seasonally decline in Q4. And so you're going to see that normal kind of robust growth pattern as you work your way sequentially through. \n On the other income front, which also drives the same-store revenue piece, that's a little bit lumpier. So we expect to see bad debt improvement and increased income from initiatives later in the year as well. So that will all help growth as you kind of continue on sequentially as well. \n And then the nonresidential side, which you saw some lumpiness in the first quarter that we disclosed in a footnote on the bottom of Page 10, that is going to be a little bit of a drag when you get to the back half of the year. But when you get to the full holistic year, it doesn't really impact same-store revenue overall. \n So normal kind of seasonal trajectory. Given the comp period, when you put it in the blender, when you look at quarter-over-quarter, we would expect the quarter-over-quarter to be lower in the back quarters of the year than they are in the first quarter. \nDerrick Metzler: Got it. And anything on expenses, too? And the cadence there for the year? \nRobert Garechana: Yes. Also pretty typical. We certainly had a very good first quarter on the expense side, better than what we anticipated as we kind of highlighted in the disclosure. And we didn't adjust guidance at all. So we do expect that it's -- while it's early, we're being a little bit cautious on the expense side. So we're hopeful that we can do better than the midpoint of our guidance range, but we'll see. \n But from a growth trajectory standpoint, remember that Q2 and Q3 are always usually the higher growth rate periods because you have more turnover going on in the portfolio because you're in the leasing season. So you expect those growth rates to be higher. And then the only other thing I would highlight is 4Q had a difficult comp period. 2023 fourth quarter growth rates were really low, and so we have a little bit of a harder comp period in the fourth quarter. But we're off to a really good start on expenses, and so we're cautiously optimistic there. \nDerrick Metzler: Thank you. Congrats on the strong quarter. \nOperator: And we'll take a question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. \nMichael Goldsmith: At what point during the year do you feel confident about maybe not hitting the low end of the guidance, like recognizing you don't make adjustments for the first quarter of print, you did speak about trends being ahead of expectations, I guess maybe the question is, are you, at this point, do you feel like you're trending at the higher end of the range or above the range? Where you sit today? And what will give you confidence about adjusting that with the next quarter? \nMark Parrell: Thanks for the question, Michael. It's Mark. We generally look at this at the end of each quarter. And because we have so much disproportionate activity in the second quarter, that it makes sense to us that that would be the time to really look hard at this. It's a really volatile world, even more so than usual, both in the economic terms and every other term you could think of. So to us, it makes some sense to wait. We've got a few markets that feel like they're poised to recover, but Seattle and San Francisco specifically. And those have been a little bit -- markets with a little bit of volatility as well. \n So I guess I don't know what to say about whether you get the low end of the guidance or the high end of the guidance, but right now we're clearly pointed to the high end of the rev number and the lower end of the expense range. But this is just 1 quarter and there's a lot of time to go. And again, we feel very optimistic and very excited about the fundamentals of the business, and we'll report back in July and tell you where we are. \nMichael Goldsmith: And my second question is, you sold a couple of properties during the quarter, used that to buy back some stock, paid out some debt, maybe fund some of these development. Would you look to kind of continue to sell at the current piece? And does the fact that -- you did talk about how there's $200 billion of dry powder on the sidelines to reinvest into real estate, like would you continue to sell even if there is nothing to acquire? \nAlexander Brackenridge: Michael, it's Alex. We're going to slow down the dispositions until we see better visibility into the acquisition side of the market. And it did feel like 2 or 3 weeks ago we were getting there, that there were -- buyers and sellers were kind of finding common ground at around 5 to 5.25. But then the inflation report came in hot, hotter than expected, and that really kind of threw everything backwards to where we were a quarter ago, where there's a pretty good spread right now, the tenure, I think, is over 4.6 today. And so we're just trying to figure out what the cap rate environment is for acquisitions. And so we'll just temper the dispose until we get a better sense of that. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. \nHaendel St. Juste: I had a follow-up on, I guess, the rent reversal -- I'm here. Can you hear me? \nMark Parrell: Yes, we can now. Go ahead, Haendel, we can hear you. \nHaendel St. Juste: Sorry about that. So had a follow up on the rent reversals during -- okay. I had a question on the rent reversals in the quarter. The improved collectibility expectations you outlined, I assume they were tied to Rite Aid. So can you outline what's changed there and why you're adjusting your expectations? And then what's the net-net of all of this beyond this year? I think you said this year was a net neutral event. So just curious if the space now spoken for or what we should expect over the next year or 2. \nRobert Garechana: Yes. Let me -- Haendel, it's Bob. Let me clarify real quick. So relative to expectations, we had in our guidance expectations as we called out the straight-line receivable reversal as it relates to nonresidential. So there's no change to expectations. \n The other thing I would point out is that the benefit in the first quarter actually has no relation to the Rite Aid lease that we talked about last year. So let me describe what it is. You may recall that during the pandemic, we actually took a large write-off of the straight-line receivable related to a variety of tenants, which converted those nonresidential tenants to a cash basis of accounting. Under the accounting literature that, over time, when your outlook on collectibility changes, you convert them back to an accrual basis level of accounting. So you put that straight line receivable back on the books. \n As you can imagine, given the nature of the tenancy and the nature of that space in the retail, we're very cautious to ensure that there was our collectibility view change. So we had a pretty high hurdle rate in terms of determining that we thought that these leases would be collectible, and we did so in the first quarter, but that was intended and anticipated in guidance. So what you saw was a return of that receivable balance. We don't expect there to be much more there in the quarterly cadence for nonresidential. And so that's kind of what that nature was specifically. \n Since you mentioned Rite Aid, I will just say one quick thing on Rite Aid because that is a rather large space. So that space, the lease was terminated associated with Rite Aid, but we have re-leased it. So we have an active lease with a very high credit quality tenant. We're in the process of putting TI dollars into that. And once those TI dollars are completed, which should happen later this year, at that point, we'll turn the space over and we can begin revenue recognition on that lease specifically. And that's the update on Rite Aid. But otherwise, there's nothing -- there's no relationship with Rite Aid at this point. \nHaendel St. Juste: That was helpful. And then on -- a question on the second quarter guide here. Yes, a quick one on the second quarter guide. It seems a bit low versus what we and I guess the Street was expecting, especially in consideration with the rental dynamics you're enjoying. So curious if there's any one-timers impacting that. Anything in there from a dispositions perspective, anything moving the needle? Or is that a clean guide? \nRobert Garechana: Yes. Good question. So as you saw from our full year guidance, we didn't adjust our full year guidance, but we did give -- provide for the first time NFFO guidance for the second quarter, and continue to maintain what is probably a little bit of a cautious outlook still. But there are a couple of callouts that I would say that are inherent in the Q2 NFFO guidance, that range that we provided, that are a little bit different than what you would have normally seen sequentially between Q1 and Q2, which I think is what you're getting at, Haendel. \n The core business continues to do what we would expect it to do as Michael just outlined. So the core kind of residential NOI business is growing the way that it would normally grow, but we won't have that sequential benefit from the straight-line receivable that I just described. So that's a little bit of drag on the sequential component. Overhead is also not declining as quickly sequentially as what it has done in historical periods for a few puts and takes. And finally, there is a little bit of transaction noise because we are front-end loaded on the disposition side. Oftentimes, when we do dispositions, we put those proceeds into 1031 accounts, which are interest-bearing cash accounts, but they don't earn as much interest as the NOI loss. That's a temporary dilution that we incur. And so that's putting a bit of a drag on the sequential Q1 to Q2 numbers. \nMark Parrell: Just to elaborate, it's Mark. We don't expect overheads to be higher or different than our guidance range. It's just the cadence of it is a little different where, for a variety of reasons, the first and second quarter are more similar than usual. And you should expect a real decline in quarters 3 and 4. So we'll update that all in July, but we don't have any expectation that overhead is net higher. It's just the drop between the quarters is occurring between quarters 3 and 2, not between quarters 1 and 2 as has often been the case. \nOperator: And we have a question from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. \nJames Feldman: Great. I guess just a follow-up to the 2Q number or 2Q guidance. So can you -- since it sounds like there's a lot of moving pieces, can you talk about just the core numbers? I mean what are you expecting for rents, blends, occupancy, same-store revenue in 2Q, just to maybe level set? \nRobert Garechana: We typically don't provide that degree of guidance. But I would tell you in terms of the actual same-store kind of revenue piece, what I would tell you is that, sequentially, what you normally see between -- in same-store revenue is call it $0.02 to $0.03 -- or NOI, sorry, is call it $0.02 to $0.03 of sequential improvement in NOI between Q1 and Q2. And that's pretty much where we are on the residential side. But we're losing, call it, about $0.01 from the nonresidential piece. We're also losing about $0.01 from the overhead kind of sequential piece along with a handful of other things in the transaction activity that we mentioned. And that's why you're only seeing $0.01 improvement sequentially. \n Keep in mind that the leasing activity that you execute in the second quarter typically has a bigger effect on revenue in the third quarter because those leases are ratably reset during the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps from a color perspective. \nJames Feldman: Okay. Yes, that's very helpful. And then maybe thinking about your debt maturities in '25. You've got $250 million expiring, you're sitting on pretty low leverage at 4x debt-to-EBITDAre. You've got 8.25 preferreds out there. It sounds like you're slowing down the disposition pipeline. I mean what are your thoughts on just other investments, other uses of capital here? What do you think on the balance sheet side -- you probably just let things ride through year-end without any kind of meaningful changes of -- or debt pay downs or pay downs of any sort? \nRobert Garechana: Yes. As you mentioned, Jamie, the balance sheet is in phenomenal shape. I mean from an absolute leverage standpoint, it's very low. But you're also highlighting something that I think is worth noting, which is we have very little interest rate exposure because we don't have a maturity or any refinancing needs until the middle of 2025. And even when you look further out, there is a modest kind of maturity piece. \n So I think when you look at use of proceeds, probably in the menu of choices, debt paydown is the last one, to be frank. And we'd be more interested on the capital allocation front, whether it's acquiring assets or otherwise, even buying back shares just from a standpoint of whatever presents a better value proposition because we don't have any maturity issues and we have very limited exposure to rates. \nOperator: And we'll take a question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. \nJohn Kim: Mark, you mentioned $200 billion of dry powder, a lot of that focused in multifamily. At the same time, we have the Blackstone-AIR transaction. How do you think that's impacted pricing or will impact pricing on sales of either assets or portfolios in the market? Could pricing be more aggressive despite the recent rise in interest rates? \nMark Parrell: Yes. That's -- I'm going to pull a little bit. It's Mark, on the comment Alex just made. I think when people saw the AIRC print, there was enthusiasm. I think when people felt like that, combined with the thought that maybe rates were going to go down in the relative near term, and you had some certainty on sort of the financial markets and such, that that was a positive thing for stability and for kind of closing that bid-ask spread that's existed for a while that Alex talked about for several quarters. \n And I think when the treasury sold off, when you saw rates really, that inflation print was high, and you have a 460-plus tenure, all of a sudden that threw that all back into play again. So I would say right now, we continue to struggle to see a great deal of product offered. I think the obvious evident enthusiasm for apartments in the private space, and we hope soon in the public space more so, is powerful. But I think there's still a bit of -- a pretty big difference between seller and buyer expectations, that I think was the gap was closing a little and now I think the gap remains. \n And Alex, how would you expound? \nAlexander Brackenridge: Yes, John, this is Alex. One thing that hasn't changed, although the rate environment is confusing to many investors, is the amount of product that's delivering, particularly in the expansion markets that we're excited about. And a lot of that just isn't capitalized to be owned for the long term. I mean it was merchant built in many cases. And we're eager to pursue that. We just need to come up with pricing that makes sense in the current rate environment. \n And there's some other owners of more stable properties that also were seeing some debt challenges, and we just expect more opportunities where, as Bob has mentioned, really well poised to take advantage of them. We just need the right price given the rate environment. \nJohn Kim: On the rebalancing strategy, it sounds like you mentioned that pricing has slowed down those efforts a little bit. At the same time, you seem very encouraged by the political environment improving in San Francisco, Seattle and New York. Do those policy changes or anything new in data as far as net migration or any other items potentially reconsider your views on either the timing or the strategy of redeploying capital into the Sunbelt? \nMark Parrell: Yes. That's really an outstanding question. I think the really good news here is that both sides, whether it's Governor DeSantis in Florida, whether it's Governor Newsom in California or in New York or Governor Healey up in Massachusetts, everyone's thinking about supply as a solution. Where in 2018 when all the tumult happened started on rent control with the California Ballot Initiative, it was all about price controls, which obviously are not going to improve supply. So I think it's really a positive that everyone is trying to address supply in different ways, with different levels of effectiveness. I think the industry has done a good job. I give a lot of credit to Barry Altshuler who is our lead regulatory guy on that and many other people in the industry who pushed that supply argument, and we're seeing the results of that, and you're right to recognize it.  \n But I also would say that places like New York, California, continue to need to work on being an attractive place to live and for businesses to locate. They need to be able to more effectively compete against places like Texas that are more attractive than they used to be in terms of amenities to our residents, our demographic, as well as to business leaders who just want to expand their operations in places where it's less complex and less expensive to do business. \n So I do say we remain open. I think New York is something we'll continue to think on. Right now, our opinion is you need to have some regulatory reforms away from housing just to make public safety better in some of those places and both to sort of encourage employers to relocate or to stay located in those markets. But I definitely see this as progress for sure. \nOperator: And we have a question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Nick. On your expansion markets, could you share the lease rates and concessionary activity for Atlanta, Austin and Dallas in 1Q and April? \nMichael Manelis: Dennis, this is Michael. So in my prepared remarks, I kind of gave you some clustering around the expansion markets concession use. Right now, for us, I would kind of cluster Denver, Atlanta and Dallas together with about 25% to 30% of our applications receiving right around anywhere between 4 to 6 weeks. \n Austin is a little bit of the outlier and it's running about 60% of our applications with almost 6 weeks of concessions. But again, we only have 3 assets in Austin, so I don't think it's kind of overly indicative of what may be happening in the broader market. \n I'll tell you, we've been watching the new lease-ups and the concessions that we see. And right now, they really seem to be in line with what you would expect. There's nothing like out of the norm that's running anywhere between 4 and 8 weeks across all of those markets. And that's kind of one of those positive signs for us. \n Relative to the first quarter, I'll tell you, we've ticked down a little bit of our concession use. Most all of these markets have occupancies above 95% right now. So as soon as we get to that threshold, we kind of pulled back a little bit of the concessions and see what does that velocity look like. And we've had a couple of strong leasing weeks. So I think the teams are dialing it back. But we do expect concessions will remain in place in those expansion markets throughout the year because the levels of supply is going to continue to increase, which means we're most likely going to see these concessions stay. As long as they stay within the realm of reasonableness in this 4- to 8-week range on the new lease-ups, I think we're okay. That's kind of how we've modeled it. \nUnknown Analyst: Follow-up question, maybe at a higher level for Mark. You talked about this in your prepared remarks, turnovers at historic lows is a real affordability benefit for the rental product versus homeownership. Just curious if you could share any high-level thoughts on how you see this dynamic evolving in the near to medium term? Could this in theory be a durable demand and profitability tailwinds over the next cycle? \nMark Parrell: Yes. I think 2 of the biggest structural advantages to the rental housing business and the apartment business are what you just identified, the fact that home ownership is just tough. And that's for a lot of reasons. So many people are locked in with the real low rates on mortgages. It makes it very attractive to stay in place even if they might move or downsize. So that will slow things down in that market. \n I think the amount of production by the homebuilders is just a lot lower than it was pre-GFC. I think the cost of ownership, including things like insurance, are significantly higher. And I think all of that together makes rental housing a lot more attractive, and that's likely to be a persistent benefit. \n And embedded in that is just a lack of supply. So even though Michael just talked about some of the impacts of supply in these expansion markets for us and for people that own in the Sunbelt, that's certainly a pretty profound impact for the next couple of years. It still means that the U.S. as a whole is undersupplied in housing. And I think at 1.5 million units a year of owned and rental housing supplied, the same as the number was in 1960 for a population twice as big, you can see the opportunity there if you own like we do, 80,000 well-positioned nice units to rent in some of the higher growth parts of the country. \n So I think those are huge secular tailwinds to our business and are likely to persist. And that's why, again, we want to stick with our strategy of having balance, being in the 12 best markets, these expansion markets, for 20%, 25% of NOI, and the remainder in these established markets where our higher-end resident wants to be and take advantage of the supply imbalances, and frankly, the preference that we think is going to be pretty persistent for rental housing. \nOperator: And we'll take a question from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. \nLinda Yu Tsai: Where are renewals going out in May? \nMichael Manelis: This is Michael. So I'll just give you a sense. So renewals right now are out in the marketplace for the next 90 days, for the next 3 months. Very consistent right now, the quotes are running between 6.5% and 7%. And that gives us a lot of confidence that we expect to achieve somewhere right around that 5% on the net effective side. \nLinda Yu Tsai: Thanks. And then just on bad debt, there's going to be a 30 basis, I guess, contribution. What's the cadence of like that is as you move through the year? \nRobert Garechana: Linda, it's Bob. We would expect to start seeing improvement in the second quarter because you saw Q4 to Q1 was relatively flat. But we're seeing some of the lead indicators, as Michael mentioned, in terms of the timing of the courts and other things, indicate that we should start to see some sequential improvement in Q2. And then we would expect it to continue on that process, although it can be volatile in Q3 and Q4 such that, by the end of the year, Q4 is maybe ends at, call it, 90 basis points of total revenue. That means for the full year, you're getting that 30 basis points of improvement. \nLinda Yu Tsai: Helpful. And then one last one. On the NYC housing laws, do you view that as more of a net benefit or a detractor for your apartments in that region? \nMark Parrell: Yes. I'm going to answer your question very precisely because I take it to mean impact on Equity Residential, and I'd say the impact on Equity Residential is pretty modest, pretty insignificant. That's because about 40% of our units are either called luxury units under the law, meaning the rents are at higher levels, or that we own newer buildings, buildings built in 2009 or later. \n And for the other units, for us to get over an 8% or 10% renewal increase, which is what the law would limit, 2023 was a great year in New York, so just looking backwards, but it wasn't that great. And it would be more impactful to us in a year like late 2021 or 2022 when we were trying to recover from the pandemic and rents were going up more quickly on renewal and we were taking away concessions. That market is not that kind of market right now. So I would expect right now for it not to be terribly significant to us. \n And again, a great benefit, I think, in trying to encourage supply, which I noted in my remarks. I just think rent control in general does not encourage more supply into the market. So we got to work through that in New York. But I do think having some certainty here for everyone involved is a plus. \nOperator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mark Parrell for closing comments. \nMark Parrell: Thank you all for your time and your interest in Equity Residential. Have a good day. \nOperator: Thank you and that does conclude today's conference.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Manelis",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. \n This morning, I will review our first quarter 2024 operating performance and our positioning as we start the leasing season. \n We're off to a very good start thus far. As Mark mentioned, demand remains good across all of our markets, supported by a continuing solid job market and high employment in our affluent renter target demographic. One of the real highlights of the quarter was our turnover, which is the lowest we have ever seen. Our focus on customer satisfaction, harnessing data and leveraging our centralized renewal team to drive results is definitely having an impact here. \n In the first quarter, we renewed more than 61% of our residents, which is one of the highest percentages that we have seen. A special shout-out to New York, Boston and Seattle, who set their own high marks and greatly contributed to this result. \n Our first quarter same-store revenue growth exceeded our original expectations, including very good performance in San Francisco and Seattle, which I will discuss in a moment. This positions us very well for the year, but we acknowledge that this is just the beginning of a critical primary leasing season. Our efforts to build occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2023, coupled with continued strong demand and high resident retention, have resulted in both slightly above average rent growth since the beginning of the year and a 50-basis point quarterly sequential gain in physical occupancy. At 96.5% occupied this month, which is one of our highest reported occupancies in April, we have a lot of confidence that we will be able to continue to grow rates through the leasing season. The high percentage of residents renewing that I previously mentioned is also a big factor in this strength. \n In terms of market same-store revenue growth, the East Coast markets in Southern California are producing leading growth, as we expected, with San Francisco, Seattle and the expansion markets following in that order. As we think about these markets' performance relative to our expectations, New York and Washington, D.C. are running ahead of expectations, while Boston and Southern California and the expansion markets are in line. San Francisco and Seattle are also running ahead, but remember, these markets have been historically volatile. So we remain cautiously optimistic that we will hold on to the gains in these markets for the remainder of the year. \n Now a little more color on the individual markets before closing out with expenses and commentary in other income and initiatives. Starting in Boston, year-to-date revenue performance is in line with the expectations. City of Boston is currently 97% occupied and we have very little competitive supply to deal with. Concession use is little to none in this market. And overall, we continue to expect Boston to deliver some of the best full year revenue growth in the portfolio. \n As I mentioned, New York is performing well, with both strong demand and pricing power. The market is over 97% occupied and has very little competitive new supply. So far, we seem to have moved past the rent fatigue we saw in the market in late 2023 and expect good things from this market in '24. \n Hats off to Washington, D.C. as this market is outperforming our revenue growth expectations even after a strong 2023. We're benefiting from a very solid employment picture here, particularly in the defense sector which is driving consistent, stable high occupancy and real strength in our retention. We see good results across the whole market, but The District has recently begun lagging our suburban assets, likely due to nearby supply. Overall, we still expect Washington, D.C. to deliver a good amount of new supply in 2024 with nearly 13,000 competitive units. So we do anticipate the pressure to continue to grow as the year progresses. \n In Los Angeles, we see good demand, but not a lot of pricing power at the moment due to the additional units being brought back to the market through the eviction process. Our portfolio is 96% occupied, and we continue to make progress on the delinquency and bad debt situation, which should be a tailwind for growth in 2024. Time frames for processing evictions have recently improved from 9 months to 6 months, which should help us make more progress going forward. But they still do remain nearly twice as long as they used to be. That being said, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement. \n Rounding out the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County are continuing to be very strong performers. The general lack of housing is keeping occupancies high. Home ownership costs are also high here, which makes renting in these markets the more attractive option. San Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year, with limited pressure at a few of our Irvine locations. \n Now for the markets that may be of most interest: San Francisco, Seattle and the expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Atlanta and Austin. For the 2 West Coast markets, remember that we entered the year with relatively modest expectations but potential for upside. So far both markets are doing better than we expected, but it's early and both remain show-me stories as we saw periods of stability and pullback in 2023. \n In San Francisco, we are well occupied but would like to see continued improvements in pricing power. The South Bay, East Bay and Peninsula continue to perform better than our Downtown portfolio. The situation here remains the same as the market lacks the catalysts, either job growth or more robust return-to-office policies, to create true pricing power. Concessions remain prevalent in the Downtown submarket, but are being issued at a lower rate than they were in the fourth quarter, consistent with what you would seasonally expect. \n In Seattle, we carried strength from December into the early part of the year, leading to improved occupancy and the ability to move up rental rates, which is evident in our new lease growth for the quarter. That being said, we do expect a fair amount of competitive new supply in the market in 2024, which could temper growth. The East Side is performing better than the City of Seattle, and our Redmond assets are performing very well despite having some direct pressure from a new lease-up. Overall, the downtowns of both markets are showing real improvement in the quality of life, and the local political situation continues to get much more constructive as a focus on bringing these cities back to the thriving environments they were prior to the pandemic remains front and center with both policymakers and citizens. Recent primary elections in San Francisco were very encouraging as voters supported candidates who are focused on addressing safety and the quality-of-life challenges. \n Finally, some commentary on our expansion markets. Strong demand and a favorable regulatory environment continue to confirm our positive long-term outlook for these markets. Unfortunately, however, in the near term, we are seeing the pressures from high levels of new supply being delivered in 2024. Market occupancies are lower than our established markets and concessions are prevalent. So far, concession usage at stabilized asset properties in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver are running at about 30% of applicants getting about 4 to 6 weeks. And in Austin, it's 60% of applicants getting about 6 weeks. Operating conditions are challenging across all of these markets, but Dallas appears to be more resilient, followed by Denver, Atlanta and then Austin. The job growth numbers in both Austin and Dallas are some of the highest in the country, which is clearly aiding in the absorption of some of the new supply. But the volume of deliveries is high and going to continue to grow throughout the year. \n With regards to bad debt and delinquency, the first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As I mentioned, we continue to see improvements in the time it is taking to process evictions in L.A., which is where the majority of our delinquent residents are, which is resulting in a decrease in the number of long-standing delinquent residents that we have. This is an encouraging sign and continues to support our view that we will see overall improvement in bad debt net contribute 30 basis points to our same-store revenue for the full year. \n Now let me hit on some highlights on expenses. Our 1.3% growth in the quarter was better than expected and driven by a decrease in both utilities and repairs and maintenance, coupled with pretty flat on-site payroll expense growth. On the utility expense, we primarily benefited from lower commodity pricing. We also intend to take advantage of federal and local incentive programs to continue to accelerate our sustainability efforts and moderate future utility growth. For example, we have 26 future solar installations planned, in addition to our 55 active systems, which will help reduce our future overall assumption. \n Our repairs and maintenance expense decrease was driven primarily by lower turnover costs and, to a lesser degree, maintenance expense, which was unusually elevated in the prior year. Once again, our disciplined approach to expense management has continued to pay off. On the innovation front, as we have previously discussed, we will be focused on a number of initiatives to drive both revenue growth and operating efficiencies. \n Specific to other income, our expectation remains unchanged that this will be a contributor of 30 basis points to our full year same-store revenue growth. During the quarter, we delivered 60 basis points, which was slightly ahead of our original expectations and mostly due to faster implementation of our parking revenue optimization program. \n In addition to our efforts around other income, we have been very focused on areas of opportunity like leveraging artificial intelligence into our business process. As early adopters of these AI interactions, we are thrilled with the performance of these tools. Over the past year, our AI leasing assistant, Ella, has engaged with just over 600,000 customer inquiries, set 2 million responses addressing prospect questions, and booked over 80,000 appointments. Leveraging this type of automation at the top of our demand funnel has been incredibly effective, allowing us to be nimble with increasing initial traffic demand without impacting our remaining on-site employees' ability to provide high-touch customer interactions when needed. We're excited to share that in the coming quarter we will begin testing an AI resident assistant, helping existing residents 24/7 with common questions about their community service and even their account statements. \n I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation and enhancing customer service. As we sit here today, we're 96.5% occupied and continue to see strength in our renewal process, which positions us very well to capture the pricing power opportunities that the peak leasing season will bring. \n With that, I turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Eric, this is Michael. So yes, I think one of the things you need to remember is that, relative to the first quarter in 2023, we are issuing more concessions right now. So that does impact a little bit of what you see in that new lease change. But clearly, when you just think about the normal rent seasonality curve, pricing trend or asking rents in the marketplace, we're seeing that sequentially build. And you're seeing that sequential improvement in kind of the new lease stats for April over March. So I think what you should expect for the next several months working our way probably even through the middle of the third quarter is that we will sequentially build new lease change up, and we will see that stability in kind of the renewal, achieved renewal increase performance. So you're right to call out that it's a little lower than norm, but right now we like the sequential improvement that we're seeing. Yes. And I think I called this out even on the first -- or the call in January, that we made a strategic decision to increase the concession use, build up that occupancy in the fourth quarter, and really have been just pulling back the concession use as we worked our way through the first quarter. The most pronounced reduction actually came out of San Francisco. I think the offset to that reduction is that we also started to utilize some concessions in LA. So when you think about the sequential change from the fourth quarter through the first quarter, our concession use ticked down a little bit but not as much as what it would have been if we didn't start increasing some of the usage in the L.A. market.\n Right now, about 50% of the concessions that we're using are concentrated in Seattle and San Francisco, with a large majority of those sitting in those downtown areas. Both of those markets are below where they were in January. And I'll tell you, we've had a really strong couple of leasing weeks. So I know the teams right now for the last several weeks have been strategically looking at where they can continue to dial back the concession use. Yes, John, this is Michael. So really, from the affordability standpoint, I wouldn't say we have any concerns at all. I mean we're not seeing a material shift. We still sit at about 20% rent-to-income ratios. And the range is fairly tight, running between like 18.5% to 24%. And the Southern California markets are sitting up at that higher range and they really historically have always been up at that level. \n So I'm not concerned about us hitting that point where the affordability index. I think what we saw in a market like New York where you had such robust rent growth through the peak leasing season last year, you hit that point where kind of you felt like you hit a rent fatigue level. We're not seeing any of that right now in the portfolio, but it's still pretty early into the leasing season. So I'm more looking at that absolute rent level than anything around the affordability of our resident base. Yes. It's a great question. So this is Michael. So I look at those markets right now and I think, clearly, we did see some marginal improvement with the migration patterns. We're still running with a slightly higher percent of new residents coming to us from within the MSA, meaning we're just trading around within the MSA. But we are marginally seeing some improvement, but we are elevated still from those historical norms. And I think we're going to remain elevated until you see the catalyst of either job growth or specific to like Downtown San Francisco really seeing kind of a more robust return-to-office policy. \n So in terms of the demand, it's not really like the migration factors that are doing it. I still think you see some folks coming from further out near or in, and that was a little bit of the catalyst that we saw. And you also get a different sense of vibrancy. I mean we talked about this now for over a year. Every quarter, the cities, those metro areas seem to start feeling better and better. And you're seeing that play out. \n So right now, our positioning -- we've got both markets sitting up at 96% occupied. It gives us a lot of confidence to keep pressuring whether we're raising the absolute rate, holding back the concession, we're seeing the sequential build in our net effective rent. And that's what we're looking for. As long as the velocity holds, we're going to do really well through the peak leasing season. But we've seen these markets before kind of have fits and starts. So I think it's just too early to call that these are wins for the year. Yes. Josh, this is Michael. Yes, they're absolutely different. And again, this remains the story about kind of the City of Seattle and Downtown San Francisco is where we see kind of the least amount of pricing power, kind of lower occupancy. So the suburban portfolios are clearly outperforming the urban, and that's a trend we've seen for a while in those markets. \n The only thing I would call out in San Francisco is that you do have some supply coming back to the South Bay and it is back-half loaded. So you do need to see kind of that demand pick up because you have like 4,000 units coming back to that submarket just later on this year. But again, it's doing -- it's performing very well right now. We saw it absorb 4,000 units a couple of years ago. So it's nothing that we're concerned, but it's still something that we're watching for. Dennis, this is Michael. So in my prepared remarks, I kind of gave you some clustering around the expansion markets concession use. Right now, for us, I would kind of cluster Denver, Atlanta and Dallas together with about 25% to 30% of our applications receiving right around anywhere between 4 to 6 weeks. \n Austin is a little bit of the outlier and it's running about 60% of our applications with almost 6 weeks of concessions. But again, we only have 3 assets in Austin, so I don't think it's kind of overly indicative of what may be happening in the broader market. \n I'll tell you, we've been watching the new lease-ups and the concessions that we see. And right now, they really seem to be in line with what you would expect. There's nothing like out of the norm that's running anywhere between 4 and 8 weeks across all of those markets. And that's kind of one of those positive signs for us. \n Relative to the first quarter, I'll tell you, we've ticked down a little bit of our concession use. Most all of these markets have occupancies above 95% right now. So as soon as we get to that threshold, we kind of pulled back a little bit of the concessions and see what does that velocity look like. And we've had a couple of strong leasing weeks. So I think the teams are dialing it back. But we do expect concessions will remain in place in those expansion markets throughout the year because the levels of supply is going to continue to increase, which means we're most likely going to see these concessions stay. As long as they stay within the realm of reasonableness in this 4- to 8-week range on the new lease-ups, I think we're okay. That's kind of how we've modeled it. This is Michael. So I'll just give you a sense. So renewals right now are out in the marketplace for the next 90 days, for the next 3 months. Very consistent right now, the quotes are running between 6.5% and 7%. And that gives us a lot of confidence that we expect to achieve somewhere right around that 5% on the net effective side."

            "name": "Mark Parrell",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2024 results and outlook for the year. \n I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance and how we see 2024 operations playing out. And then we will take your questions. \n We are pleased with our first quarter performance, which was ahead of January expectations and reflects the strong demand for the lifestyle our well-located apartment properties provide as well as little new competitive supply across most of our established markets. Our same-store revenues increased 4.1% in the quarter, and our same-store expenses rose only 1.3%, which led to same-store NOI growth of 5.5% and an increase in our NFFO per share of 6.9%. \n So overall, a very solid start to the year across all categories, with the company well positioned to capture increasing seasonal demand as we head into our prime leasing season. As is our practice, we have not revised our operating or FFO guidance, and we'll make adjustments as we get deeper into our primary leasing season. \n Digging under the hood a bit, the durability of the employment picture for our target affluent renter demographic is a continuing bright spot in our business as is the cost of owned housing. Unemployment for the college educated, a very sizable percentage of our residents, remains at around 2%, considerably lower than the overall average, supporting demand. This demographic, which is well employed in the growth engines of our economy, including technology, financial services and other professional and business services, continues to grow in both our established and expansion markets. \n We also see a little competition from owned housing as the high cost of homes, combined with elevated financing costs and rapidly rising insurance, real estate tax and maintenance costs combine to make rental housing a very attractive option for many people. Social factors that we've discussed on prior calls like smaller households and delayed marriage and childbearing add to the attractiveness of rental housing. \n In the quarter just ended, the percentage of our residents leaving us to buy homes was 7.8%, a continuation of all-time lows. Strong demand and high single-family housing costs are consistent conditions across both our coastal established markets that represent 95% of our company's NOI and our new expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Denver and Austin, that collectively represent 5% of our NOI. \n But on the apartment supply side, we see 2 very different pictures playing out in our established coastal markets versus our expansion markets. With the exception of Seattle and Central D.C. in our established coastal markets, we see the terrific demand I just mentioned being met with generally little new supply, leading to solid rent growth. Across our 4 expansion markets, we see robust demand as well, but it is being met by an overwhelming wave of new supply, leading to declining rent levels, high concessions and occupancy pressure. We expect this pressure to accelerate as units continue to deliver in these oversupplied markets, especially once the prime leasing season concludes and demand seasonally declines. \n Switching to expenses, Michael is going to go over all that with you in a moment. But I wanted to take a second to thank our teams across the company for their amazing work on expense management. We are very pleased to have produced a sector-leading 3.1% average growth rate of same-store expenses over the last 5 years. Our teams have embraced innovation and a customer service mindset and are not afraid of change, and it shows in these numbers. Well done, team. \n On the investment side, we are seeing properties that we would be interested in acquiring, well-located newer properties in our expansion markets in the suburbs of Seattle and Boston trade at high prices and in very low volume compared to pre-pandemic levels. Investment sales activity in the first quarter was over 60% below average pre-pandemic levels. Estimates from my colleagues who attended the recent ULI conference indicate that there is over $200 billion of dry powder looking to invest in North American real estate, with a significant portion focused on apartments. Recent data points from the pending AIRC transaction and apartment portfolio and one-off deals are similarly supportive of much higher values than the public market is currently suggesting. \n While this is a huge positive signal about the underlying value of our company, it has slowed our portfolio rebalancing efforts. And while pricing in most of the apartment transaction market is strong, buyer interest is not yet fully evident for some of the large urban West Coast assets that we want to dispose of as part of our strategic rebalancing. We expect that to change as these submarkets continue to show improved operations and better quality of life conditions. \n In the meantime, with the lack of actionable acquisition opportunities, we saw value in our own stock. So we continue to strategically deploy disposition proceeds from the sale of older inferior properties in our portfolio into repurchases of our stock. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $38.5 million of our own common shares at a weighted average share price of about $59 per share. Since we began this activity in the fourth quarter of 2023, we have repurchased approximately $87.5 million of our shares in what we see as an attractive valuation level of a bit below $58 per share. We are using the remaining disposition dollars to drive down our already low leverage, which will create more internal debt dry powder for when opportunities do emerge. We are going to continue to be disciplined in our transaction activities with a focus on growing cash flow over the long term.  \n With regard to external growth, we are on track to deliver 6 newly completed joint venture developments in 2024. These 6 properties, 3 located in Dallas-Fort Worth, 2 located in Denver and 1 located in suburban New York, will be delivered at a weighted average stabilized yield north of 6% and will contribute meaningfully to our normalized FFO starting in 2025 given their completion and lease-up timing. The 3 Dallas-Fort Worth developments are the first completed projects to come out of our partnership with Toll Brothers. With some of the other equity residential executives, I recently visited all 6 of these development projects, and I'm inspired by the enthusiasm on display from our lease-up teams and excited about adding these high-quality assets to our portfolio. \n Before I turn it over to Michael, I wanted to make a quick comment on the new housing laws that were passed over the weekend in New York, though I know we are still digesting the law and its implications. The law allows for renewal increases of CPI plus 5% up to 10%, and provides for vacancy decontrol on the types of units we generally own in New York, which allows rents to move to market when a new resident moves in, and that's similar to the rent laws that were passed a few years ago in California. \n Overall, new price controls on an already undersupplied good, in this case, rental housing, is not an effective way to attract private capital to help solve the housing supply problem in New York State. However, there are also tax incentives in the new law for new rental construction subject to a new higher wage scale required for labor on larger buildings as well as permanent affordability rules. There are also some language on zoning reforms and some rules that aim to make office-to-residential conversions easier. \n While the rent control provisions are not helpful, we commend the governor and the legislature for focusing on a supply-based solution similar to recent legislation passed in such politically disparate states as Florida and California. We think focusing on supply, not heavy-handed regulation, has been recognized on both sides of the aisle as the long-term solution. While the new law adds to the complexity of operating in New York, a good portion of our portfolio in New York City is exempt either due to being built during or after 2009 or meeting the luxury exemption thresholds. We'll be happy to discuss all this further in Q&A. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Yes, I'm just going to elaborate. It's Mark, Steve, I'd add a little bit. Again, we do see that improvement in Downtown San Francisco, but it's not yet the job growth we probably need to drive rents. But we're 14% or so below rent levels that we're pre-pandemic. So there's definitely room here. Incomes have gone up, as we've talked about on the calls. \n The crime statistics in the city of San Francisco generally have really improved compared to last year and compared to pre-pandemic levels. And as Michael said, politically, we think the March 2024 primary was a real watershed moment. We think the citizens really took it upon themselves on both public safety and other matters to really take back their city. So we're excited about some of the progress there. \n The AI revolution is a big driver potentially for San Francisco, the city and the Bay Area more widely. Our numbers indicate that the Bay Area is getting 13x more funding than the next metro area in terms of AI investment. Now that's very significant. \n Now those jobs aren't that many yet. I mean they are a few hundred. They're not the thousands. So we're not seeing that job growth yet that we really need to drive our numbers. But we are seeing that network effect where companies like OpenAI was incubated at UC Berkeley and it opted to stay in San Francisco. Some of these incubator firms have moved back in to San Francisco from the city, from the suburbs. So that's all really positive. \n In Seattle, I just want to give a plug for our friends in the Northwest, I mean this enormous $700 million project, their version of the Big Dig, to take the Alaskan Way highway and put it underground and really activate the waterfront is really significant. It's driving tourism, it's driving activation slowly but surely in Downtown Seattle. \n Seattle's problem is really going to be the supply issues. There's just a fair bit of supply. But we do see activity levels improving. And again, politically, the city council and the mayor are much more focused in Seattle on public safety and quality of life because that's what their constituents have told them to be focused on. \n So again, we're pretty excited. And I guess we'd make the statement that we continue to see Seattle and San Francisco as when, not if, stories. And the when could be this year if things continue as they are, but we need to see a little few more months of continued good results in a market that, again, can give you a head fake once in a while. Steve, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. I mean we are still in active litigation, as you suggested in your comment or your question. So there's not a lot I can say. Just to give you a little background, this has been a case that's been going on for 10 years. About the amount of late fees, we just got a ruling from a judge that was adverse to our interest, so we adjusted the reserve. We are considering our appeal options. So to your point about adjustments, they could go up or down depending on our actions. \n Also the judge didn't give us a number. He gave us a methodology, and we're working out with claimant's council what that means. So we can charge late fees, it's just the amount that's an issue. So we need to figure that out. So there could certainly be additional adjustments. I wouldn't expect them to be terribly significant upward. But if we win an appeal, I guess there could be a downward adjustment. But this is going to go on for a little while yet, I would think. Thanks for the question, Michael. It's Mark. We generally look at this at the end of each quarter. And because we have so much disproportionate activity in the second quarter, that it makes sense to us that that would be the time to really look hard at this. It's a really volatile world, even more so than usual, both in the economic terms and every other term you could think of. So to us, it makes some sense to wait. We've got a few markets that feel like they're poised to recover, but Seattle and San Francisco specifically. And those have been a little bit -- markets with a little bit of volatility as well. \n So I guess I don't know what to say about whether you get the low end of the guidance or the high end of the guidance, but right now we're clearly pointed to the high end of the rev number and the lower end of the expense range. But this is just 1 quarter and there's a lot of time to go. And again, we feel very optimistic and very excited about the fundamentals of the business, and we'll report back in July and tell you where we are. Yes, we can now. Go ahead, Haendel, we can hear you. Just to elaborate, it's Mark. We don't expect overheads to be higher or different than our guidance range. It's just the cadence of it is a little different where, for a variety of reasons, the first and second quarter are more similar than usual. And you should expect a real decline in quarters 3 and 4. So we'll update that all in July, but we don't have any expectation that overhead is net higher. It's just the drop between the quarters is occurring between quarters 3 and 2, not between quarters 1 and 2 as has often been the case. Yes. That's -- I'm going to pull a little bit. It's Mark, on the comment Alex just made. I think when people saw the AIRC print, there was enthusiasm. I think when people felt like that, combined with the thought that maybe rates were going to go down in the relative near term, and you had some certainty on sort of the financial markets and such, that that was a positive thing for stability and for kind of closing that bid-ask spread that's existed for a while that Alex talked about for several quarters. \n And I think when the treasury sold off, when you saw rates really, that inflation print was high, and you have a 460-plus tenure, all of a sudden that threw that all back into play again. So I would say right now, we continue to struggle to see a great deal of product offered. I think the obvious evident enthusiasm for apartments in the private space, and we hope soon in the public space more so, is powerful. But I think there's still a bit of -- a pretty big difference between seller and buyer expectations, that I think was the gap was closing a little and now I think the gap remains. \n And Alex, how would you expound? Yes. That's really an outstanding question. I think the really good news here is that both sides, whether it's Governor DeSantis in Florida, whether it's Governor Newsom in California or in New York or Governor Healey up in Massachusetts, everyone's thinking about supply as a solution. Where in 2018 when all the tumult happened started on rent control with the California Ballot Initiative, it was all about price controls, which obviously are not going to improve supply. So I think it's really a positive that everyone is trying to address supply in different ways, with different levels of effectiveness. I think the industry has done a good job. I give a lot of credit to Barry Altshuler who is our lead regulatory guy on that and many other people in the industry who pushed that supply argument, and we're seeing the results of that, and you're right to recognize it.  \n But I also would say that places like New York, California, continue to need to work on being an attractive place to live and for businesses to locate. They need to be able to more effectively compete against places like Texas that are more attractive than they used to be in terms of amenities to our residents, our demographic, as well as to business leaders who just want to expand their operations in places where it's less complex and less expensive to do business. \n So I do say we remain open. I think New York is something we'll continue to think on. Right now, our opinion is you need to have some regulatory reforms away from housing just to make public safety better in some of those places and both to sort of encourage employers to relocate or to stay located in those markets. But I definitely see this as progress for sure. Yes. I think 2 of the biggest structural advantages to the rental housing business and the apartment business are what you just identified, the fact that home ownership is just tough. And that's for a lot of reasons. So many people are locked in with the real low rates on mortgages. It makes it very attractive to stay in place even if they might move or downsize. So that will slow things down in that market. \n I think the amount of production by the homebuilders is just a lot lower than it was pre-GFC. I think the cost of ownership, including things like insurance, are significantly higher. And I think all of that together makes rental housing a lot more attractive, and that's likely to be a persistent benefit. \n And embedded in that is just a lack of supply. So even though Michael just talked about some of the impacts of supply in these expansion markets for us and for people that own in the Sunbelt, that's certainly a pretty profound impact for the next couple of years. It still means that the U.S. as a whole is undersupplied in housing. And I think at 1.5 million units a year of owned and rental housing supplied, the same as the number was in 1960 for a population twice as big, you can see the opportunity there if you own like we do, 80,000 well-positioned nice units to rent in some of the higher growth parts of the country. \n So I think those are huge secular tailwinds to our business and are likely to persist. And that's why, again, we want to stick with our strategy of having balance, being in the 12 best markets, these expansion markets, for 20%, 25% of NOI, and the remainder in these established markets where our higher-end resident wants to be and take advantage of the supply imbalances, and frankly, the preference that we think is going to be pretty persistent for rental housing. Yes. I'm going to answer your question very precisely because I take it to mean impact on Equity Residential, and I'd say the impact on Equity Residential is pretty modest, pretty insignificant. That's because about 40% of our units are either called luxury units under the law, meaning the rents are at higher levels, or that we own newer buildings, buildings built in 2009 or later. \n And for the other units, for us to get over an 8% or 10% renewal increase, which is what the law would limit, 2023 was a great year in New York, so just looking backwards, but it wasn't that great. And it would be more impactful to us in a year like late 2021 or 2022 when we were trying to recover from the pandemic and rents were going up more quickly on renewal and we were taking away concessions. That market is not that kind of market right now. So I would expect right now for it not to be terribly significant to us. \n And again, a great benefit, I think, in trying to encourage supply, which I noted in my remarks. I just think rent control in general does not encourage more supply into the market. So we got to work through that in New York. But I do think having some certainty here for everyone involved is a plus. Thank you all for your time and your interest in Equity Residential. Have a good day."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Robert Garechana",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Derrick. It's Bob. I'll take that. Let me start because there's a few pieces driving this, but let me start on the same-store revenue front with the residential rental component. Our assumption for residential rental income is that we anticipate a year that is pretty normal, meaning that sequentially, we expect the blended rates to continue to get better until they seasonally decline in Q4. And so you're going to see that normal kind of robust growth pattern as you work your way sequentially through. \n On the other income front, which also drives the same-store revenue piece, that's a little bit lumpier. So we expect to see bad debt improvement and increased income from initiatives later in the year as well. So that will all help growth as you kind of continue on sequentially as well. \n And then the nonresidential side, which you saw some lumpiness in the first quarter that we disclosed in a footnote on the bottom of Page 10, that is going to be a little bit of a drag when you get to the back half of the year. But when you get to the full holistic year, it doesn't really impact same-store revenue overall. \n So normal kind of seasonal trajectory. Given the comp period, when you put it in the blender, when you look at quarter-over-quarter, we would expect the quarter-over-quarter to be lower in the back quarters of the year than they are in the first quarter. Yes. Also pretty typical. We certainly had a very good first quarter on the expense side, better than what we anticipated as we kind of highlighted in the disclosure. And we didn't adjust guidance at all. So we do expect that it's -- while it's early, we're being a little bit cautious on the expense side. So we're hopeful that we can do better than the midpoint of our guidance range, but we'll see. \n But from a growth trajectory standpoint, remember that Q2 and Q3 are always usually the higher growth rate periods because you have more turnover going on in the portfolio because you're in the leasing season. So you expect those growth rates to be higher. And then the only other thing I would highlight is 4Q had a difficult comp period. 2023 fourth quarter growth rates were really low, and so we have a little bit of a harder comp period in the fourth quarter. But we're off to a really good start on expenses, and so we're cautiously optimistic there. Yes. Let me -- Haendel, it's Bob. Let me clarify real quick. So relative to expectations, we had in our guidance expectations as we called out the straight-line receivable reversal as it relates to nonresidential. So there's no change to expectations. \n The other thing I would point out is that the benefit in the first quarter actually has no relation to the Rite Aid lease that we talked about last year. So let me describe what it is. You may recall that during the pandemic, we actually took a large write-off of the straight-line receivable related to a variety of tenants, which converted those nonresidential tenants to a cash basis of accounting. Under the accounting literature that, over time, when your outlook on collectibility changes, you convert them back to an accrual basis level of accounting. So you put that straight line receivable back on the books. \n As you can imagine, given the nature of the tenancy and the nature of that space in the retail, we're very cautious to ensure that there was our collectibility view change. So we had a pretty high hurdle rate in terms of determining that we thought that these leases would be collectible, and we did so in the first quarter, but that was intended and anticipated in guidance. So what you saw was a return of that receivable balance. We don't expect there to be much more there in the quarterly cadence for nonresidential. And so that's kind of what that nature was specifically. \n Since you mentioned Rite Aid, I will just say one quick thing on Rite Aid because that is a rather large space. So that space, the lease was terminated associated with Rite Aid, but we have re-leased it. So we have an active lease with a very high credit quality tenant. We're in the process of putting TI dollars into that. And once those TI dollars are completed, which should happen later this year, at that point, we'll turn the space over and we can begin revenue recognition on that lease specifically. And that's the update on Rite Aid. But otherwise, there's nothing -- there's no relationship with Rite Aid at this point. Yes. Good question. So as you saw from our full year guidance, we didn't adjust our full year guidance, but we did give -- provide for the first time NFFO guidance for the second quarter, and continue to maintain what is probably a little bit of a cautious outlook still. But there are a couple of callouts that I would say that are inherent in the Q2 NFFO guidance, that range that we provided, that are a little bit different than what you would have normally seen sequentially between Q1 and Q2, which I think is what you're getting at, Haendel. \n The core business continues to do what we would expect it to do as Michael just outlined. So the core kind of residential NOI business is growing the way that it would normally grow, but we won't have that sequential benefit from the straight-line receivable that I just described. So that's a little bit of drag on the sequential component. Overhead is also not declining as quickly sequentially as what it has done in historical periods for a few puts and takes. And finally, there is a little bit of transaction noise because we are front-end loaded on the disposition side. Oftentimes, when we do dispositions, we put those proceeds into 1031 accounts, which are interest-bearing cash accounts, but they don't earn as much interest as the NOI loss. That's a temporary dilution that we incur. And so that's putting a bit of a drag on the sequential Q1 to Q2 numbers. We typically don't provide that degree of guidance. But I would tell you in terms of the actual same-store kind of revenue piece, what I would tell you is that, sequentially, what you normally see between -- in same-store revenue is call it $0.02 to $0.03 -- or NOI, sorry, is call it $0.02 to $0.03 of sequential improvement in NOI between Q1 and Q2. And that's pretty much where we are on the residential side. But we're losing, call it, about $0.01 from the nonresidential piece. We're also losing about $0.01 from the overhead kind of sequential piece along with a handful of other things in the transaction activity that we mentioned. And that's why you're only seeing $0.01 improvement sequentially. \n Keep in mind that the leasing activity that you execute in the second quarter typically has a bigger effect on revenue in the third quarter because those leases are ratably reset during the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps from a color perspective. Yes. As you mentioned, Jamie, the balance sheet is in phenomenal shape. I mean from an absolute leverage standpoint, it's very low. But you're also highlighting something that I think is worth noting, which is we have very little interest rate exposure because we don't have a maturity or any refinancing needs until the middle of 2025. And even when you look further out, there is a modest kind of maturity piece. \n So I think when you look at use of proceeds, probably in the menu of choices, debt paydown is the last one, to be frank. And we'd be more interested on the capital allocation front, whether it's acquiring assets or otherwise, even buying back shares just from a standpoint of whatever presents a better value proposition because we don't have any maturity issues and we have very limited exposure to rates. Linda, it's Bob. We would expect to start seeing improvement in the second quarter because you saw Q4 to Q1 was relatively flat. But we're seeing some of the lead indicators, as Michael mentioned, in terms of the timing of the courts and other things, indicate that we should start to see some sequential improvement in Q2. And then we would expect it to continue on that process, although it can be volatile in Q3 and Q4 such that, by the end of the year, Q4 is maybe ends at, call it, 90 basis points of total revenue. That means for the full year, you're getting that 30 basis points of improvement."

One is -- and we talked a little bit about this last quarter, is leaning in more on some ROI projects, specifically renovations, some solar installations, some smart rent installations as well, and EV chargers. So there's some things that we can toggle up and down. They have ROIs on them, and they're discretionary. So that's in the mix. \n There's also an element of catch-up from the pandemic. Those are projects that we just couldn't get to because we didn't want to disrupt our residents who were staying at home at that time. And so there's a little bit of catch-up there. So we're going to have a couple of more years of that, we think. So I think this 3,800-ish number is pretty good. Yes. Josh, it's Alex. In Seattle, we're 60% urban and 40% suburban. In San Francisco, it's the opposite of that. So we have a broader suburban exposure there. Michael, it's Alex. We're going to slow down the dispositions until we see better visibility into the acquisition side of the market. And it did feel like 2 or 3 weeks ago we were getting there, that there were -- buyers and sellers were kind of finding common ground at around 5 to 5.25. But then the inflation report came in hot, hotter than expected, and that really kind of threw everything backwards to where we were a quarter ago, where there's a pretty good spread right now, the tenure, I think, is over 4.6 today. And so we're just trying to figure out what the cap rate environment is for acquisitions. And so we'll just temper the dispose until we get a better sense of that. Yes, John, this is Alex. One thing that hasn't changed, although the rate environment is confusing to many investors, is the amount of product that's delivering, particularly in the expansion markets that we're excited about. And a lot of that just isn't capitalized to be owned for the long term. I mean it was merchant built in many cases. And we're eager to pursue that. We just need to come up with pricing that makes sense in the current rate environment. \n And there's some other owners of more stable properties that also were seeing some debt challenges, and we just expect more opportunities where, as Bob has mentioned, really well poised to take advantage of them. We just need the right price given the rate environment."
