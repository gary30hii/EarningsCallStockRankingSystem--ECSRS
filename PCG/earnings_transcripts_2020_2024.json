At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to, Matt Fallon, Senior Director, Investor Relations, PG&E. Mr. Fallon, please go ahead.\nMatt Fallon: Good morning. Thank you for participating in PG&E's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining us today are Patti Poppe, our Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Foster, Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer. I want to remind you that our discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, which are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations, and information currently available to Management. Some of the important factors that could affect the Company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's fourth quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures and can be found online along with other information at investor.pgecorp.com. We also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. With that, let's move on to the person you all want to hear from, Patti Poppe.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. I am so delighted to be with you for my very first PG&E earnings call today. I've been here almost two months, and have learned a lot by engaging with my coworkers, and many external stakeholders. All highlights today, our 2020 results, our 2021 and long-term outlook and what I've learned so far from careful listening, and importantly, what we're doing about it right now. We delivered solid Q4 non-GAAP core earnings of $0.21 per share in the fourth quarter, and $1.61 for the full year. We're affirming non-GAAP core earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per fully diluted share for 2021. In addition, we're rolling forward our five-year plan, which takes us through 2025. I'm happy to report that we successfully executed the sale of our transmission tower wireless licenses, delivering on our goal to reduce our 2021 equity needs. Our 2021 equity needs are now down to a range of zero to $400 million. We have visibility on our investments and we're increasing the quality of the plan and our guidance. Today, we're introducing a 2021 to 2025, non-GAAP core EPS CAGR of 10%. As we bring our new leadership team into place, we're building a clear sky playbook based on a lean operating system and delivering a regionalized hometown experience. We're evaluating our work plan focused on what's best longer-term for our customers. We're already acting on all of this and we're happy to share more with you today. You'll hear more about this in future quarters as well. Chris will provide an update and more details on the financials in just a minute. First, a recap of 2020, it was a challenging year, and I am so impressed with how our PG&E team stepped up. I'd like to take a second just to thank Bill Smith for serving as our interim CEO, and Michael Lewis for his tireless efforts serving as Interim Utility President. My co-workers made great progress on many fronts under their leadership, and I'll quickly touch on a few. The team continued to make progress on wildfire risk reduction, while also significantly improving the execution of our public safety power shutoff events through better coordination, and support for our customers and our communities. My co-workers successfully resolved key regulatory cases. And while no one could have predicted the impact of COVID-19, the team has stood up for the challenge delivering energy to our friends, families, and neighbors. I spent a good portion of my first weeks listening, listening to you listening to our customers, policymakers, regulators, co-workers, shareholders, and many, many more. What you've said is direct and you've communicated both disappointment and encouragement. Thank you for your honest feedback. I've also spent time engaging with our federal monitor and our operational observer from the governor's office. We want what they want, a safer system. We've embraced their feedback and have continued to implement improvements to our wildfire mitigation work with an unwavering focus to reduce the risk of utility ignited wildfires. One such example includes our evolution from a 2020 Wildfire Mitigation Plan that was primarily activity based, focused on miles completed for our key wildfire safe measure, such as enhanced vegetation management and system hardening. We're moving to a 2021 Wildfire Mitigation Plan that is risk focused, addressing the highest risk areas for mitigation on our top most priority, informed by enhanced predictive wildfire risk models. We've developed and implemented machine learning capabilities, enabling an evolution from static to dynamic risk models. These models are informed by fire ignition probability and potential wildfire consequence, considering fast burning fuels, predictive fire behavior, and buildings and population density impacts. Additionally, we're leveraging state-of-the-art remote sensing capabilities to obtain an understanding of both the fuel type and condition that contribute to a fire spread in our high-risk areas. While we continue to perform the longer-term work of enhanced vegetation management and system hardening using a risk informed approach, our PSPS event implementation remains an important tool of last resort to keep our customers safe. We'll continue to focus on improving the PSPS program for our customers and our communities, keeping in mind that preventing electric equipment caused wildfires and associated damage is the highest priority. For 2020, I'm happy to share that our enhanced weather forecasting, our generation islanding capabilities, and sectionalizing devices, many of which were installed in 2020 led to more targeted PSPS events in 2020 versus 2019 for similar weather conditions. We identified a number of reported damages and hazards to our equipment from high wind conditions during six PSPSP events in 2020. Any one of these instances could have potentially caused a wildfire if our system had not been proactively de-energized. In addition, our weather stations along with our high-definition cameras and satellite detection capabilities enable us to determine when high fire risk has dissipated. And when we can begin safely restoring power. These factors along with our increased aerial surveillance helped us reduce patrol and restoration times by nearly 40% in 2020. We were also able to improve our notification accuracy for impacted customers in advance of the PSPS events from levels below 90% in 2019 to 99.5% in 2020. This was enabled through the deployment of an innovative records and information management integration platform where we are partnering with Palantir to quickly and seamlessly consolidate data for our electric assets and customers from separate and disparate data sets. This has been a game changer for us and we're expanding this technology solution to serve as the core enabling technology for building our centralized data systems, bringing together physical, operational, lifecycle and environmental data elements to drive data informed decisions for our wildfire mitigation programs and beyond. The substantial improvements in 2020 over 2019 in our PSPS event implementation were noticed by many, and yet, we are still dissatisfied. And we've already begun implementing improvements for our 2021 Wildfire Mitigation and PSPS programs. In fact, during my first few weeks on the job, I had the opportunity to see the team in action during a very unusual January PSPS event. The team quickly sprang into action, enabling a cross functional focus on an end-to-end process. I saw our emergency response playbook in action, and it was good. The strong gusty winds we forecasted and our assessment of the dry fuels and potential fire spread risk in localized areas of our service territory, led us to shut off power to keep our customers safe, while the dangerous weather passed. Let me be clear about this point. The goal is to prevent damage and destruction from our equipment. And we'll choose to protect our customers and our communities even when that means utilizing PSPS. I was impressed that we have the technology to pinpoint our highest risk areas and target the specific sections of our system to prevent potential wildfires that would hurt people. Now moving into 2021, we will embrace the triple bottom line mindset of serving people, our planet and California's prosperity. This mindset will find an intersection between the need to safely deliver energy and meet the clean energy aspirations of Californians. I'm optimistic that there is a bright path forward with a triple bottom line enabled by a laser like focus on performance. Here are my initial observations and priorities to get us moving as we start 2021. We have a best-in-class emergency response playbook. And we're going to complement that by writing the PG&E clear sky playbook. So, we can predictably deliver every day, not just during and after a crisis. I'm putting together a team of senior leaders that's developing that clear sky playbook underpinned by a lean operating system that predictably delivers on our commitments and outcomes. We're bringing the best of a functional organizational design, standard, processes and scale to deliver a regionalized hometown experience for the communities and customers we serve. And finally, our system requires substantial capital investment and our customers deserve more discipline cost performance. We'll adopt better processes that improve our safety, quality, delivery and cost. Our work will deliver for customers and our investors. On my first day at PG&E, I went to Paradise in Butte County, to see the devastation caused from wildfires. I met with my co-workers who live in the community whose own lives were forever impacted by the Camp Fire. We're so grateful to those who have the strength and the courage to represent PG&E through the rebuilding efforts. When I reflect on when PG&E first developed our skills in disaster response, I go back to San Bruno. I visited the city of San Bruno a couple weeks ago, and I met with our co-workers who served their community there. They express the disappointment they felt that day and the helplessness of not being the heroes for the very first time. It was frustrating not being able to deliver as our Bluecrew strives to do delivering an essential service safely to our customers every day. PG&E has learned to respond to the challenges of emergencies and have developed a world class playbook for emergency response. My passion is to capture that capability and focus to establish a clear sky playbook. Playbook to deliver disaster prevention, the basics of the building blocks for a safe, reliable, affordable, clean and resilient system. [Indiscernible] before processes that cause delays and leave our frontline teams having to explain to customers why we can't deliver as promised, our daily performance is sometimes a mystery to the organization. We learn about issues when the customer tenaciously escalates their frustrations and then we jump to respond. We must enable our co-workers in the field to become problem preventers and solvers, not victims of poor processes. Improving the reliability of our day-to-day work will move us away from being just an emergency response company we need and we'll implement a clear sky lean operating system to effectuate this change, because it works. We're assembling the team to do just that. Adam Wright is our new Chief Operating Officer. Adam joins PG&E after serving for 18 years at Berkshire Hathaway and for the past three years as President and CEO of MidAmerican Energy. Adam brings a strong track record of operational performance at Mid-American and he'll focus on safety, standardizing practices and promoting excellent execution across the board. Adam's hand on approach has already started to show its value. I love how he leads with his heart and his mind. We need that. Marlene Santos is our new Chief Customer Officer. Marlene joins us after an impressive career at NextEra Energy, most recently serving as President of Gulf Power. Marlene led the integration effort of the acquisition of Gulf Power, and she was able to deploy a best-in-class operating system to a new organization which delivered meaningful results for the customers of Gulf Power. We're counting on Marlene to help us do the same here at PG&E. Julius Cox is our Chief Human Resources Officer and leader of our Shared Services and Supply Chain, a team charged with ensuring PG&E has the people, skills, resources and tools to meet customers' expectation. Prior to joining PG&E, Julius served as Chief Human Resource Officer AEP and Chief Transformation Officer at Dynegy. Joe Foreline, is our new SVP of Gas Operations. Joe joins PG&E after 35 years at PSEG, serving most recently as Vice President of Gas Operations and prior to that as Vice President of Customer Solutions. We're really excited for Joe to leverage his experience to enhance our focus on both gas operations and customer service. This team is coming for the mission and more are on their way. They all had great jobs and they were not looking to leave. I call them each and they answered the call to serve. These clear eyes and fresh legs, combined with the 25000 dedicated, resilient and smart PG&Eneers that I found here, will be the necessary ingredients to turn this company into a winning team. We're focusing on meeting and exceeding the expectations of those we are privileged to serve, our friends, our families and our neighbors. The new team will establish a regionalized daily heartbeat, that puts decision making where it belongs, closest to our customers and communities. I visited crews in many areas across our service area and the themes are clear, we're showing up in our home towns like a big company with a big company bureaucracy, and that needs to change. There are advantages to the scale of a big company, and we'll leverage them to the best of functional expertise, high quality standards, and that will be delivered by our regional cross-functional teams. Our customers don't need to feel that big company mindset, they need to feel like their hometown is the only one that matters. Our hometown team can deliver for them by being empowered to solve the problems they see with the cross-functional team on which they work. Our clear sky lean playbook will be essential in transforming our culture, our processes and our outcomes. Now, you might ask Patti, that all sounds great, but how will that deliver financial results? Well, this brings me to my final observation. We can accelerate the path to better financial health at PG&E by fixing the operational results we deliver. Our regulators, our legislators, our customers, my co-workers, and, yes, you, our investors can believe in PG&E again. Everyone can believe when we deliver, when we keep our promises, when we do what we say, we will do. There's a playbook for a great utility and we'll be writing ours here at PG&E. More to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned earlier, we made substantial progress against the goals we set forth in 2020, including on the financial and regulatory front. I'll hit a few highlights, then go into more detail. We met our EPS guidance planning at $1.61 for the year. We reduced our equity needs to a range of zero to $400 million, reducing our prior range of $450 million to $750 million as a result of our successful non-core asset sale. We also made progress on our longer-term savings goal, including achieving over $300 million in savings from a combination of contracted work savings and from monetizing excess renewable energy credits in 2020. And we closed our critical regulatory cases that provide multi-year financial clarity. I plan to cover our 2020 results and regulatory updates first, then focus on 2021 and beyond. I'll walk through new term targets and favorable updates to our 2021 financing needs as well as our longer-term financial plan. And we see improvements in our prior projection, getting us to a 10% earnings per share growth CAGR. As I mentioned, we met our earnings guidance for 2020 and are maintaining the 2021 range we set out of $0.95 to a $1.05. Let's start with 2020. Slide 9 shows our result for both the fourth quarter and the year. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the year came in at $2 billion. GAAP earnings including non-core items are also shown here. The non-core items listed here are also consistent with the full year 2020 guidance range and includes a $60 million net charge in the fourth quarter is all related wildfire cost, after applying insurance receivables. Moving to Slide 10. This shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $441 million or $0.21 in the fourth quarter of last year. The largest driver of the quarter-over-quarter change was an increase in shares outstanding from our July 1st equity raise. Additionally, we saw decrease in EPS resulting from unrecoverable interest expense, the timing of nuclear refilling outages, inspection cost and some small miscellaneous items. The decreases were partially offset by growth array-based earnings and the impact of charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to interest on pre-petition payables and short-term debt and the timing of the 2020 general rate case cost recovery. I will now shift to covering a few significant updates on the regulatory front, specifically 2020 for the progress we saw help cement our multi-year earnings per share growth visibility. I'll start with FERC. In December, FERC approved our transition owner 2020 settlement, establishing formula rate, a dollar return equity of 10.45% and a capital structure that's 49.75% equity through 2023. FERC also completed the review of our AFEDC waiver filing, allowing us to apply the 49.75% equity ratio on AFEDC back to May of 2019. At the CPUC, there are number of proceedings in play, including our Wildfire Mitigation Plan filing that Patti covered. I'll focus now on four additional key filings. Our 2020 general rate case, two securitization cases and our upcoming 2023 general rate case filing. As a reminder, our 2020 GRC received a final decision in December. The revenue requirement approved in our 2020 GRC mirrors the amount from our initial settlement agreement. Importantly, the final decision authorizes two-way balancing accounts for vegetation management, wildfire mitigation and liability insurance premium cost. We will implement new rates as authorized in the final decision starting next month. In the rate neutral securitization proceeding, we filed an alternative in mid-January that recognize concerns raised during the proceeding. This alternative is consistent with our goals of ensuring we can accelerate payments to the Fire Victims Trust, meeting our commitment to pursuing a transaction structure that is expected to be rate neutral and maintaining our credit treatment so this cost-efficient transaction can be effectuated with maximum benefit of the utility and its customers. In alternative filing, instead of contributing $1.8 billion in 2021 to the customer credit trust, we proposed to contribute $1 billion in 2021 and $1 billion in 2024. Additionally, we proposed that the CPUC could conduct proceeding in 2040 to determine whether an additional shareholder funded contribution is needed to keep the structure rate neutral. Any additional contribution will be capped at $775 million. We are confident based on our modeling that the risk of this additional one-time payment 20 years from now has a low probability of occurring. The proceeding is currently scheduled for proposed decision in April and a commission decision in May. Yesterday, we also filed our first AB 1054 related securitization request at the CPUC. This is the first tranche of what it's likely to be free and totals roughly $1.2 billion. This reflects the work we've completed thus far and it forecasts the expenditures for 2021, relative to the total $3.2 billion of qualified spend. We expect to receive a decision on the financing application in late June, and that could bring us to market as early as Q3. Finally, we're scheduled to file our 2023 general rate case by the end of June. This case will be different from previous general rate cases for two reasons. First, we will incorporate not just selective distribution but also gas transmission and storage which was previously a separate case. Second, this case will cover four years, 2023 through 2026 rather than three years providing certainty over longer horizon. Our substantial investments to reduce risk of wildfires and enhance public safety will continued to be highlight in this case. Moving forward to 2021 guidance on Slide 11. We have adjusted non-GAAP core earnings to $2.1 billion to $2.25 billion from $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion for the year and maintain our prior EPS guidance of approximately $0.95 to $1.05 per share. This non-GAAP core earnings target is $300 million to $425 million below our authorized level with a range mostly comprised of interest expense of $300 million to $325 million. We anticipate net below the line and spend above authorized will be substantially lower than 2020 as we carry out additional efficiency measures in 2021, bringing a range of zero to $100 million there. Also noted here is the assumption underlying 2021 guidance that we received authorization the second quarter for our securitization request. It is designed to be rate neutral to customers as originally filed. Moving to non-core earnings guidance which is broken out on the same slide. We've made a couple of adjustments to these items. Our range for bankruptcy and legal costs guidance increased to a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects two items. First, based on current discussions with the Fire Victims Trust and input from the IRS, we expect to elect grantor trust treatment for the shares issued to the Fire Victim Trust. Grantor trust treatment would result in a deduction equal to the fair value of the shares held by the Fire Victim Trust when ultimately sold by the trust, instead of when the shares were placed into the trust. Accordingly, there would be a $1.3 billion charge when the grantor trust election is made reflecting the elimination of the existing deferred tax asset and then income recognized over time as the Fire Victim Trust sell their shares in future periods. Similarly, we would anticipate gains in future periods as shares are sold by the trust. Given we have until April to complete this review, should we elect the grantor trust treatment, it would result in a charge in that scenario in Q1. The second element of bankruptcy and legal costs to note is exit financing costs reflecting temporary utility debt that increased from $60 million pretax to a range of $95 million to $135 million. This reflects our updated assumption of rate neutral securitizations starting in the second quarter, and assumes two tranches. We also anticipate a range of $10 million to $20 million in legal and other costs related to the 2019 Kincade Fire that are recorded in the period incurred and separate from the claim's accrual. Additionally, for investigation remedies, we have lowered our forecast to roughly $110 million. This $30 million decrease is permanent. And we will apply it towards the wildfire OII spend requirement. Our full year guidance for the net securitization inception charge, amortization of the wildfire fund contribution and prior period net regulatory recoveries remain unchanged. Next, I'll cover our updated 2021 equity needs. As you can see on Slide 11, we've updated the range to reflect equity needs of zero to $400 million for the year. This substantial reduction reflects the cash impact in 2021 of our non-core license transaction that was announced earlier this month. I'm also pleased to share that we close the transaction as well and have received the vast majority of the initial proceeds. This lower equity range benefits our shareholders, including the fire victim trust and reducing dilution. As Patti touched on, we have updated our five-year plan as well with projections from 2021 through 2025 that you can see on Slide 12 through 14. Here we are showing incremental positive updates. Our non-GAAP core earnings growth is driven by 8.5% rate base growth. This is underpinned by focusing on the key investments that reduce risk and improve service to our customers, primarily in our wildfire mitigation and gas system needs. We also continue to be focused on holding company debt reduction to improve our balance sheet off over time. We anticipate paying down over $2 billion over the next three years and further reducing the holding company debt balance down to approximately $1 billion in 2025. Together these factors fuel our non-GAAP core earnings growth of over 10% and we are guiding to 10% non-GAAP core EPS growth. This includes an assumption of some equity needs following 2021, which stem from increases in our capital spend, and would follow our capital structure. We plan to provide more specifics on equity needs for each year when we issue our annual four-year guidance. As a team, we are determined to execute well on both the operational and financial plans we set out that benefit all elements of the triple bottom line and drive prosperity for our state and investors. With that, I'll turn it back over to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Chris. The path to reestablish PG&E is simple, the implementation is our challenge, will meet the challenge and here's how. We have a best-in-class emergency response playbook and we'll build on it by writing the PG&E clear sky playbook. I'm putting together a team of senior leaders that are ready writing and implementing that lean playbook that can predictably deliver our commitments and our outcomes. We're building the best of centralized functions, standards, processes and scale and we'll deliver a regionalized hometown experience for the communities and customers we serve. And finally, our system requires substantial capital investment, and our customers deserve more discipline cost performance. We'll adopt better processes that improve our safety, quality, delivery and cost. As a result, our work will deliver for our customers and for our investors. These initial priorities are the steps on the path to a new era at PG&E, focused on people, planet, and prosperity with laser like focus on performance. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator instructions] Richard Ciciarelli with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. It's Julien here. Thanks for the time and opportunity. And I should add...\nPatti Poppe: Hey Julien, nice to hear your voice.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Likewise, I should have my congratulations to you, Patti, as well as the portion of the management team here. It's a pleasure, congrats, all. But with this, can we speak a little bit more about equity and ability to reduce them that further? So, a couple different questions within this. Securitization, can you speak to what's reflected in your updated expectations here? And then secondly, just want to be very explicit about the asset sales here and that contributing to your narrowed range here as well, if you don't mind.\nChris Foster: Sure, Julien this is Chris. Hi. Happy to take that one. I think there's really two factors to think about. First, let's start with the underlying assumption. Embedded within the zero to $400 million guidance is the as filed original case that we put forward to the CPUC. Should the alternative we filed be approved, it could further reduce that equity need, which would take us down potentially is that low into the range, again, zero to $400 million. That's because we have spaced out the two contributions, a billion dollars in 2021 and a billion dollars in 2024. As it relates to the Tower's transaction, that definitely helped us to bring down the original high end of $700 million - excuse me, $750 million, to where we are today at $400 million. We consistently articulated as you know upon completion of that transaction, we will be focused on reducing our financing needs overall. And it certainly heavily contributed to our equity needs reduction.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then secondly, Patti if I can put it back to you here. Obviously, short time here thus far, but the safety certification process, I suppose this is going to be an annual conversation here. But when we think about this, going forward, and just getting these on a timely basis, how do you think about improving that process to just give folks and all stakeholders visibility on that, if you don't mind?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, this is actually an area Julien that I'm pretty excited about. And I feel good about our ability to build a transparent system. So, anybody and anyone who wants to can be aware of the status of our wildfire mitigation plans, it's a perfect application of our clear sky playbook is to prepare and prevent disaster. And so, we're actually leveraging our lean playbook, we've got four basic plays, and we're going to apply them to our wildfire mitigation plan. We're actually in the process, we've already initiated building out a control center at our San Ramon facility, where we'll be able to observe the progress, monitor problem, solve, establish standards, continuously improve. I am finding, we've got some incredibly talented people here, they just need a process, we need a system to make visible our commitments. And that enables us to make and meet our commitments. And so, the work that we're going to do, I think, will give the commission the visibility that they need. We welcome their partnership. We welcome their oversight, the policymakers have a lot at stake with our success. And they've shared that with me. And so, our job is to make it easy for them to regulate us, easy for them to monitor us. Because I can tell you this, no one's going to be looking closer at us than us. And so, we're going to be watching our performance. And we're going to be utilizing our clear sky playbook to do just that. And that should make those filings and that process much more streamlined, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys. Best of luck.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you.\nOperator: Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Fleishman: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Patti. Congrats.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Good to hear your voice. Yes. So, I guess one question, so it sounds like in the past the long-term growth rate was the net income growth and now it's an EPS growth. So, to degree that you do need future equity in the plan because your investment is higher that's some of that's embedded in the growth [Indiscernible].\nPatti Poppe: That's of course is embedded, and that's what made us feel pretty confident about our forward look on EPS, and shifting today, EPS oriented long-term growth target. But Chris, why don't you add a couple points on that?\nChris Foster: Sure thing, Patti. That's right, Steve. As you think about the growth that's embedded in our rate base update, there's over $2 billion an additional investment there. And so, what we've what we put forward is an EPS growth rate that absolutely includes future equity needs through that time period.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. And then secondly, just on the back last year when there was the uncertainty over the wildfire safety certificate, there was also some mention by the commission of the kind of enhanced oversight process. Is there any update on that? And that obviously hasn't happened. So, should we view that as a good sign or is that still kind of a potential event to watch?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, Steve, we have not had official notification or close out of the letter that was sent at the end of last year on enhanced enforcement. So, honestly, Steve, I don't think we'd be surprised if that action happened. The first step is just a corrective action plan. And frankly, that's what we're building out. We've been working very closely with the wildfire staff at the commission to make sure that our plans meet expectations. But it's certainly within the realm of possibility that the commission might take that step. And frankly, we welcome it. I don't see that as a bad thing, Steve. It all comes down to this. Look, we've got to do what we said we're going to do. Our plan for 2021 wildfire mitigation is good. It has enhanced over 2020. 2020 was better than 2019. We're using more technology, we're doing more fire prevention with our enhanced vegetation management, with our better visibility. We're using technology tools that are honestly impressive. I'm impressed by them. And we're reducing the impact PSPS events. So, all of that being said, we have confidence in our plan. We welcome additional oversight. I wouldn't be concerned if additional oversight and the enhanced enforcement was initiated because the commission has a job to do. And we welcome the visibility. And as I said, we're building out our lean operating system to really drive home the performance of that wildfire mitigation plan, and it'll provide all the visibility and transparency that's required.\nSteve Fleishman: Great, congrats again, Patti. Thanks.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Ryan Levine with Citi. Your line is open.\nRyan Levine: Hi, everybody. One for Patti. Is this new clear sky playbook you fully written at this point, or is it more in the initial drafting stages? Is there a timeline that you expect this playbook to be fully written?\nPatti Poppe: That's a great question. One of the things that excites me, is this team I'm building, in addition to very impressive talent I'm finding here at PG&E, we're going to have the best of the best influencing this playbook. So certainly, people know that I have a lean orientation and lots of experience. So, I have a point of view on this matter. But we're hiring some really talented people. Marlene Santos is going to bring a playbook. And so, trust me, we're going to lean into that next era playbook of Marlene's. Berkshire Hathaway has a playbook and Adam brings that with them. And so, we will be looking for the best of the best lean operating system that matches the PG&E needs and addresses what we need to address here most. But I will say the basic plays of our lean operating system will include visual management, operating reviews, problem solving and standards. It's clear to me and my - already and just the two months I've been here that those plays are essential to us being able to keep our promises and do what we say we're going to do. And so, the kind of the framework of the playbook is written. But we'll have the best of the best, certainly adding to that playbook and making sure that it reflects the specific needs of the PG&E team. So, in terms of, on your question on timing, we expect to have the fundamentals of the playbook written by midyear. But we'll be always continually updating and improving our playbook. But that's the spirit of lean operating system, we're never going to be satisfied. Right. We could have best ever performance and still be dissatisfied. And so, that playbook will ever be an evolution. And so, I wouldn't suggest that there's a finish line to it, but we will be getting better every day.\nRyan Levine: And then, in terms of the wildfire mitigation plan that came out earlier this month. Was there any changes to that you wanted to call out in terms of your forecast time horizon for any more meaningful opportunities around that effort that you could envision to evolve in the coming years?\nPatti Poppe: Well, I'll hone in on the work. And I'll let Chris weigh in just a second on the financial implications. But the work itself, the big change for 2021 over 2020 is the risk orientation of the plan. 2020, we've got a lot of work done, we did a lot of vegetation management and system hardening. But it was more based on volume of work. And what we're transitioning in 2021 to which I think will really meet the needs of both the system and certainly a lot of the observers that we have is that we're transitioning to a risk prioritized system. And so, it's really important that we prioritize the work that we're doing to maximize the amount of risk we reduce every single year. And so, we're targeting a 20% reduction of the highest risk areas of the system. And so, we're going to be focused on that as well as additional technology, additional weather stations, additional cameras, our weather meteorology system is really very advanced, and we're going to continue to advance it. And so, more to come on all on the work. And that's a big change for 2021 but in terms of the financials, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Foster: Sure, thanks, Patti. Hi, Ryan. The way I would think about this, as we've got the three-year wildfire mitigation plan fully embedded in our five-year forecast from the financial side. What we're able to do though, as we improve the plan and see the work plan longevity here. What we're able to do is work with our colleagues to reduce costs and be more efficient along the way. I mentioned this a little bit earlier. But we have been able through improved contracting, already been able to take out a few $100 million out of the business. And so, as we improve the ability to take out the riskiest miles every year that Patti's referencing, the work plan will be tighter year over year as well. But at this stage, ultimately, all three years of what was filed here back in February is currently reflected in the five-year plan.\nRyan Levine: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys. And congratulations, Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning Jonathan.\nJonathan Arnold: Just a quick one on, you've obviously assembled an impressive group of new leaders. Are we done with that process or is there still more to come?\nPatti Poppe: I'm sorry, Jonathan, can you repeat your question?\nJonathan Arnold: Yeah. Just curious on the leadership team, if you're pretty much done with what you're planning there, or there's more to come?\nPatti Poppe: Thank you. No, we're not done. There's more to come. And I think you'll like what you see. We still have an engineering role, which we've highlighted as an important role, I think for PG&E, because we've spent so much time responding to crisis, that I think there's been a loss of the ability to focus on the horizon, to get focused on the future of the clean energy transformation and how that clean energy transformation overlaps with the need for wildfire prevention. And I think, there's a really exciting opportunity where new technologies with the right engineering team can mitigate our multiple risks, supply shortages in the summer, wildfire mitigation, as well as our clean energy transformation. And so, we're definitely we've got some great names coming. I'm not going to, we've broken up news today. We'll be sharing the additional news here in the coming weeks of additional talent that's joining the team.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay, great. Thank you and maybe more for Chris. I guess, Chris could you perhaps just explain, it may be a reminder, just this the charge to do with the grantor trust a bit more and maybe focus on the implications for cash and timing and the like? And if there's any sort of knock-on impact on financing needs? And if recall that, you'd wanted to - you've been wanting to elect the grantor trust, so, my assumption is that, this is an outcome that, although there's going to be an upfront charge, it would be helpful.\nChris Foster: Sure, Jonathan, thanks for the question. Happy to take it too and I appreciate it because definitely, I want to simplify this. This is ultimately good tax planning for the company. The bottom line is, if we are able to elect the grantor trust construct, which we're on a good path, we've noted here today that we've had current ongoing discussions with the Fire Victim Trust and from IRS. So, we believe it's likely we'll be able to make that election. What would happen, there is no impact to financing needs. And let me unpack that a little bit. So, PG&E will be required to take that $1.3 billion noncash charge reversing the deferred tax asset we created. And that's ultimately just an advantage that we gain here, right, because now, the advantage of the grantor trust is, we're able to experience the benefit of the share price appreciation that would occur. So, we'll reverse that charge as soon as we recognize income in future period, which depends on the price at which the Fire Victim Trust sells the stock. So, should we elect the grantor trust, which we'll do by April, there are no financing changes, we will benefit from a tax standpoint, and the Fire Victim Trust would benefit as well from the construct from a tax planning purpose?\nJonathan Arnold: Great. And that's probably, we kept it simple. Thank you.\nOperator: Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, Patti, and team congrats to everybody on your new roles. My question is a little more longer term and trying to think about the work that company will do to help the state achieve its goals and vice versa. Anytime, I've seen a regulated utility succeed over the long-term. And succeed is probably defined in terms of providing reliable, safe, low cost, clean power whereas low cost as possible. It also comes with supportive policymaking and regulation. Those two things tend to go hand in hand. When you look at how California policies set up and align right now, and the things that are in place, but also the things that might be on your wish list, things that maybe aren't in place today, but could exist tomorrow, whether it's policy, whether it's regulation or something else, what would be on that wish list?\nPatti Poppe: Well, good morning. Thank you for asking the question. A couple of things. First, one thing I will share. As a newcomer to the California scene, I have been pleasantly surprised by the regulatory environment and the construct. I think, outside of California, I told myself things about what was true here and now that I am here. There's some really good components of our regulatory construct multiyear general rate cases with attrition adjustments. Many of you know that I have not - I have long advocated for annual filings, because you need flexibility and adjustment. But as I see the California construct, we have these long-term rate cases and filings and outcomes that provide long-term certainty to revenue. But we still have balancing accounts that allow for that flexibility to adjust and adapt as needs and conditions for our customers change. And I like that a lot. That's a good part of the construct, the decoupling the pass-throughs costs associated with commodity procurement. All of these elements make for a pretty solid regulatory construct, when we do what we said we would do. And so, it comes back to that whole thing. So, my wish list, Michael, truly is that we are reliable again, and our word stands. And so that's the focus of our efforts, it's the focus of our attention. Now, to your point about the long-term aspirations of policymakers here around clean energy and affordable energy. You may be aware that the commission held a non-bond event yesterday, and I was very optimistic about what I heard from that event. There's a real recognition that there's a risk that the entire clean energy transition, the cost of it is born in a residential electric bill. And that, in many ways is basically a regressive tax. Its tax policy borne out in electric bills. And the good news is, that was part of the conversation yesterday that we need to make sure that we have holistic cost sharing for the clean energy transition. And frankly, if we do our job, right, we can help reduce costs. And certainly, the unit cost of energy should go down as electrification takes hold both in buildings vehicles. So, I do think, if I had a wish list outside of my own wish list that we do what we say we're going to do, the rest of my wish list would be that we as California come together and find a holistic set of solutions that meet the expectations of our citizens. I find the ambitions inspiring, and we do it together as a state and that we don't finger point and sub optimize, but rather we work together to come for a great outcome, the best outcome for Californians, which frankly, then can be a role model for the rest of the world.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Yep, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Patti, just want to say thanks for all the observations, congratulations as well, but maybe just kind of taking a step back just as far as what brought you to this position that you felt compelled to take it and just as you look at PCG versus your experience at CMS, just wondering if it makes sense to contrast what you see here? Or maybe just ask more directly as the CMS way the right fit for PCG? Or could the clear sky playbooks look different?\nPatti Poppe: Well, first of all, a little shout out to all my friends at CMS. They know I love them. And I think about them all the time. I was compelled by the mission here at PG&E. And this is what I'm finding, both in the people who are here, the people who stayed, they say when the going gets tough, the tough get going. And this team has got going. I mean, this PG&E team that I have met is resilient and strong and they are here and they have stayed, and I'm proud of them and grateful for them for their endurance. The additional team members we're bringing along and the reason I am here is because we felt compelled by this cause that the people of California need PG&E to be strong. We need PG&E to have the capability to answer the call that the citizens and the policymakers are defining. And so, when I thought about both the citizens of California, and I thought about the people who work at PG&E, at the end of the day, Jeremy, I just couldn't turn away. And I think people know, I had a pretty good gig back there in Michigan. But to sit and not do my part, just didn't feel like an acceptable choice. So, I came out, and I'm happy to report again, that people are coming with me. And it's really, it's a mission worth serving. Now, I'll also say that it won't be the CMS playbook. It will be the PG&E playbook. We have to write our own based on the current conditions and needs of the system. And but the lean concepts are universal. And they weren't written at CMS, had they were written 100 years ago. Deming wrote some of the early fundamentals and lots of companies have implemented them. And I've seen it implemented well, and I've seen it implemented poorly. And we're going to implement it well. I do think my years of experience do bring visibility and perspective about what good looks like when we talk about a lean implementation. And so, the team and I here are writing that playbook. And we're going to implement it. And I'm highly confident that it will provide the certainty and the transparency and the ability to deliver outcomes, not just activity, but outcomes for the sake of the people that we serve.\nJeremy Tonet: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for that. And maybe just a separate question on the SBA agreement. Just if you could walk us through what happens if, god forbid, there was a cause of a fire from the telco asset. Just how would that work exactly there?\nChris Foster: Sure. So, in terms of the agreement, the way to think about it, Jeremy's at a high level, in all situations, PG&E retains the ability to have appropriate and safe access to its facilities. That's everything from pole loading, ensuring that any new facilities that are cited, are done so only in a situation where we know ahead of time that the additional weight is appropriate. It also means that if there's impacts to the facilities, certainly in that situation, it would be evaluated for a liability at that stage. But ultimately, where we're focused is and this is really the impetus behind the agreement was to ensure that going forward, PG&E maintain the flexibility to manage our assets as we need to do and that flexibility remains with this agreement.\nJeremy Tonet: Great. I'll stop there. Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Patti Poppe for final remarks.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Jack. Well, thanks everyone for the discussion today. It really was good to be with all of you. We are looking forward to staying in touch in the coming months and certainly most importantly, restoring your trust and your confidence in the PG&E team. Thanks again for joining us today.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned earlier, we made substantial progress against the goals we set forth in 2020, including on the financial and regulatory front. I'll hit a few highlights, then go into more detail. We met our EPS guidance planning at $1.61 for the year. We reduced our equity needs to a range of zero to $400 million, reducing our prior range of $450 million to $750 million as a result of our successful non-core asset sale. We also made progress on our longer-term savings goal, including achieving over $300 million in savings from a combination of contracted work savings and from monetizing excess renewable energy credits in 2020. And we closed our critical regulatory cases that provide multi-year financial clarity. I plan to cover our 2020 results and regulatory updates first, then focus on 2021 and beyond. I'll walk through new term targets and favorable updates to our 2021 financing needs as well as our longer-term financial plan. And we see improvements in our prior projection, getting us to a 10% earnings per share growth CAGR. As I mentioned, we met our earnings guidance for 2020 and are maintaining the 2021 range we set out of $0.95 to a $1.05. Let's start with 2020. Slide 9 shows our result for both the fourth quarter and the year. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the year came in at $2 billion. GAAP earnings including non-core items are also shown here. The non-core items listed here are also consistent with the full year 2020 guidance range and includes a $60 million net charge in the fourth quarter is all related wildfire cost, after applying insurance receivables. Moving to Slide 10. This shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $441 million or $0.21 in the fourth quarter of last year. The largest driver of the quarter-over-quarter change was an increase in shares outstanding from our July 1st equity raise. Additionally, we saw decrease in EPS resulting from unrecoverable interest expense, the timing of nuclear refilling outages, inspection cost and some small miscellaneous items. The decreases were partially offset by growth array-based earnings and the impact of charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to interest on pre-petition payables and short-term debt and the timing of the 2020 general rate case cost recovery. I will now shift to covering a few significant updates on the regulatory front, specifically 2020 for the progress we saw help cement our multi-year earnings per share growth visibility. I'll start with FERC. In December, FERC approved our transition owner 2020 settlement, establishing formula rate, a dollar return equity of 10.45% and a capital structure that's 49.75% equity through 2023. FERC also completed the review of our AFEDC waiver filing, allowing us to apply the 49.75% equity ratio on AFEDC back to May of 2019. At the CPUC, there are number of proceedings in play, including our Wildfire Mitigation Plan filing that Patti covered. I'll focus now on four additional key filings. Our 2020 general rate case, two securitization cases and our upcoming 2023 general rate case filing. As a reminder, our 2020 GRC received a final decision in December. The revenue requirement approved in our 2020 GRC mirrors the amount from our initial settlement agreement. Importantly, the final decision authorizes two-way balancing accounts for vegetation management, wildfire mitigation and liability insurance premium cost. We will implement new rates as authorized in the final decision starting next month. In the rate neutral securitization proceeding, we filed an alternative in mid-January that recognize concerns raised during the proceeding. This alternative is consistent with our goals of ensuring we can accelerate payments to the Fire Victims Trust, meeting our commitment to pursuing a transaction structure that is expected to be rate neutral and maintaining our credit treatment so this cost-efficient transaction can be effectuated with maximum benefit of the utility and its customers. In alternative filing, instead of contributing $1.8 billion in 2021 to the customer credit trust, we proposed to contribute $1 billion in 2021 and $1 billion in 2024. Additionally, we proposed that the CPUC could conduct proceeding in 2040 to determine whether an additional shareholder funded contribution is needed to keep the structure rate neutral. Any additional contribution will be capped at $775 million. We are confident based on our modeling that the risk of this additional one-time payment 20 years from now has a low probability of occurring. The proceeding is currently scheduled for proposed decision in April and a commission decision in May. Yesterday, we also filed our first AB 1054 related securitization request at the CPUC. This is the first tranche of what it's likely to be free and totals roughly $1.2 billion. This reflects the work we've completed thus far and it forecasts the expenditures for 2021, relative to the total $3.2 billion of qualified spend. We expect to receive a decision on the financing application in late June, and that could bring us to market as early as Q3. Finally, we're scheduled to file our 2023 general rate case by the end of June. This case will be different from previous general rate cases for two reasons. First, we will incorporate not just selective distribution but also gas transmission and storage which was previously a separate case. Second, this case will cover four years, 2023 through 2026 rather than three years providing certainty over longer horizon. Our substantial investments to reduce risk of wildfires and enhance public safety will continued to be highlight in this case. Moving forward to 2021 guidance on Slide 11. We have adjusted non-GAAP core earnings to $2.1 billion to $2.25 billion from $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion for the year and maintain our prior EPS guidance of approximately $0.95 to $1.05 per share. This non-GAAP core earnings target is $300 million to $425 million below our authorized level with a range mostly comprised of interest expense of $300 million to $325 million. We anticipate net below the line and spend above authorized will be substantially lower than 2020 as we carry out additional efficiency measures in 2021, bringing a range of zero to $100 million there. Also noted here is the assumption underlying 2021 guidance that we received authorization the second quarter for our securitization request. It is designed to be rate neutral to customers as originally filed. Moving to non-core earnings guidance which is broken out on the same slide. We've made a couple of adjustments to these items. Our range for bankruptcy and legal costs guidance increased to a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects two items. First, based on current discussions with the Fire Victims Trust and input from the IRS, we expect to elect grantor trust treatment for the shares issued to the Fire Victim Trust. Grantor trust treatment would result in a deduction equal to the fair value of the shares held by the Fire Victim Trust when ultimately sold by the trust, instead of when the shares were placed into the trust. Accordingly, there would be a $1.3 billion charge when the grantor trust election is made reflecting the elimination of the existing deferred tax asset and then income recognized over time as the Fire Victim Trust sell their shares in future periods. Similarly, we would anticipate gains in future periods as shares are sold by the trust. Given we have until April to complete this review, should we elect the grantor trust treatment, it would result in a charge in that scenario in Q1. The second element of bankruptcy and legal costs to note is exit financing costs reflecting temporary utility debt that increased from $60 million pretax to a range of $95 million to $135 million. This reflects our updated assumption of rate neutral securitizations starting in the second quarter, and assumes two tranches. We also anticipate a range of $10 million to $20 million in legal and other costs related to the 2019 Kincade Fire that are recorded in the period incurred and separate from the claim's accrual. Additionally, for investigation remedies, we have lowered our forecast to roughly $110 million. This $30 million decrease is permanent. And we will apply it towards the wildfire OII spend requirement. Our full year guidance for the net securitization inception charge, amortization of the wildfire fund contribution and prior period net regulatory recoveries remain unchanged. Next, I'll cover our updated 2021 equity needs. As you can see on Slide 11, we've updated the range to reflect equity needs of zero to $400 million for the year. This substantial reduction reflects the cash impact in 2021 of our non-core license transaction that was announced earlier this month. I'm also pleased to share that we close the transaction as well and have received the vast majority of the initial proceeds. This lower equity range benefits our shareholders, including the fire victim trust and reducing dilution. As Patti touched on, we have updated our five-year plan as well with projections from 2021 through 2025 that you can see on Slide 12 through 14. Here we are showing incremental positive updates. Our non-GAAP core earnings growth is driven by 8.5% rate base growth. This is underpinned by focusing on the key investments that reduce risk and improve service to our customers, primarily in our wildfire mitigation and gas system needs. We also continue to be focused on holding company debt reduction to improve our balance sheet off over time. We anticipate paying down over $2 billion over the next three years and further reducing the holding company debt balance down to approximately $1 billion in 2025. Together these factors fuel our non-GAAP core earnings growth of over 10% and we are guiding to 10% non-GAAP core EPS growth. This includes an assumption of some equity needs following 2021, which stem from increases in our capital spend, and would follow our capital structure. We plan to provide more specifics on equity needs for each year when we issue our annual four-year guidance. As a team, we are determined to execute well on both the operational and financial plans we set out that benefit all elements of the triple bottom line and drive prosperity for our state and investors. With that, I'll turn it back over to Patti. Sure, Julien this is Chris. Hi. Happy to take that one. I think there's really two factors to think about. First, let's start with the underlying assumption. Embedded within the zero to $400 million guidance is the as filed original case that we put forward to the CPUC. Should the alternative we filed be approved, it could further reduce that equity need, which would take us down potentially is that low into the range, again, zero to $400 million. That's because we have spaced out the two contributions, a billion dollars in 2021 and a billion dollars in 2024. As it relates to the Tower's transaction, that definitely helped us to bring down the original high end of $700 million - excuse me, $750 million, to where we are today at $400 million. We consistently articulated as you know upon completion of that transaction, we will be focused on reducing our financing needs overall. And it certainly heavily contributed to our equity needs reduction. Sure thing, Patti. That's right, Steve. As you think about the growth that's embedded in our rate base update, there's over $2 billion an additional investment there. And so, what we've what we put forward is an EPS growth rate that absolutely includes future equity needs through that time period. Sure, thanks, Patti. Hi, Ryan. The way I would think about this, as we've got the three-year wildfire mitigation plan fully embedded in our five-year forecast from the financial side. What we're able to do though, as we improve the plan and see the work plan longevity here. What we're able to do is work with our colleagues to reduce costs and be more efficient along the way. I mentioned this a little bit earlier. But we have been able through improved contracting, already been able to take out a few $100 million out of the business. And so, as we improve the ability to take out the riskiest miles every year that Patti's referencing, the work plan will be tighter year over year as well. But at this stage, ultimately, all three years of what was filed here back in February is currently reflected in the five-year plan. Sure, Jonathan, thanks for the question. Happy to take it too and I appreciate it because definitely, I want to simplify this. This is ultimately good tax planning for the company. The bottom line is, if we are able to elect the grantor trust construct, which we're on a good path, we've noted here today that we've had current ongoing discussions with the Fire Victim Trust and from IRS. So, we believe it's likely we'll be able to make that election. What would happen, there is no impact to financing needs. And let me unpack that a little bit. So, PG&E will be required to take that $1.3 billion noncash charge reversing the deferred tax asset we created. And that's ultimately just an advantage that we gain here, right, because now, the advantage of the grantor trust is, we're able to experience the benefit of the share price appreciation that would occur. So, we'll reverse that charge as soon as we recognize income in future period, which depends on the price at which the Fire Victim Trust sells the stock. So, should we elect the grantor trust, which we'll do by April, there are no financing changes, we will benefit from a tax standpoint, and the Fire Victim Trust would benefit as well from the construct from a tax planning purpose? Sure. So, in terms of the agreement, the way to think about it, Jeremy's at a high level, in all situations, PG&E retains the ability to have appropriate and safe access to its facilities. That's everything from pole loading, ensuring that any new facilities that are cited, are done so only in a situation where we know ahead of time that the additional weight is appropriate.

But ultimately, where we're focused is and this is really the impetus behind the agreement was to ensure that going forward, PG&E maintain the flexibility to manage our assets as we need to do and that flexibility remains with this agreement."

            "name": "Patti Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. I am so delighted to be with you for my very first PG&E earnings call today. I've been here almost two months, and have learned a lot by engaging with my coworkers, and many external stakeholders. All highlights today, our 2020 results, our 2021 and long-term outlook and what I've learned so far from careful listening, and importantly, what we're doing about it right now. We delivered solid Q4 non-GAAP core earnings of $0.21 per share in the fourth quarter, and $1.61 for the full year. We're affirming non-GAAP core earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per fully diluted share for 2021. In addition, we're rolling forward our five-year plan, which takes us through 2025. I'm happy to report that we successfully executed the sale of our transmission tower wireless licenses, delivering on our goal to reduce our 2021 equity needs. Our 2021 equity needs are now down to a range of zero to $400 million. We have visibility on our investments and we're increasing the quality of the plan and our guidance. Today, we're introducing a 2021 to 2025, non-GAAP core EPS CAGR of 10%. As we bring our new leadership team into place, we're building a clear sky playbook based on a lean operating system and delivering a regionalized hometown experience. We're evaluating our work plan focused on what's best longer-term for our customers. We're already acting on all of this and we're happy to share more with you today. You'll hear more about this in future quarters as well. Chris will provide an update and more details on the financials in just a minute. First, a recap of 2020, it was a challenging year, and I am so impressed with how our PG&E team stepped up. I'd like to take a second just to thank Bill Smith for serving as our interim CEO, and Michael Lewis for his tireless efforts serving as Interim Utility President. My co-workers made great progress on many fronts under their leadership, and I'll quickly touch on a few. The team continued to make progress on wildfire risk reduction, while also significantly improving the execution of our public safety power shutoff events through better coordination, and support for our customers and our communities. My co-workers successfully resolved key regulatory cases. And while no one could have predicted the impact of COVID-19, the team has stood up for the challenge delivering energy to our friends, families, and neighbors. I spent a good portion of my first weeks listening, listening to you listening to our customers, policymakers, regulators, co-workers, shareholders, and many, many more. What you've said is direct and you've communicated both disappointment and encouragement. Thank you for your honest feedback. I've also spent time engaging with our federal monitor and our operational observer from the governor's office. We want what they want, a safer system. We've embraced their feedback and have continued to implement improvements to our wildfire mitigation work with an unwavering focus to reduce the risk of utility ignited wildfires. One such example includes our evolution from a 2020 Wildfire Mitigation Plan that was primarily activity based, focused on miles completed for our key wildfire safe measure, such as enhanced vegetation management and system hardening. We're moving to a 2021 Wildfire Mitigation Plan that is risk focused, addressing the highest risk areas for mitigation on our top most priority, informed by enhanced predictive wildfire risk models. We've developed and implemented machine learning capabilities, enabling an evolution from static to dynamic risk models. These models are informed by fire ignition probability and potential wildfire consequence, considering fast burning fuels, predictive fire behavior, and buildings and population density impacts. Additionally, we're leveraging state-of-the-art remote sensing capabilities to obtain an understanding of both the fuel type and condition that contribute to a fire spread in our high-risk areas. While we continue to perform the longer-term work of enhanced vegetation management and system hardening using a risk informed approach, our PSPS event implementation remains an important tool of last resort to keep our customers safe. We'll continue to focus on improving the PSPS program for our customers and our communities, keeping in mind that preventing electric equipment caused wildfires and associated damage is the highest priority. For 2020, I'm happy to share that our enhanced weather forecasting, our generation islanding capabilities, and sectionalizing devices, many of which were installed in 2020 led to more targeted PSPS events in 2020 versus 2019 for similar weather conditions. We identified a number of reported damages and hazards to our equipment from high wind conditions during six PSPSP events in 2020. Any one of these instances could have potentially caused a wildfire if our system had not been proactively de-energized. In addition, our weather stations along with our high-definition cameras and satellite detection capabilities enable us to determine when high fire risk has dissipated. And when we can begin safely restoring power. These factors along with our increased aerial surveillance helped us reduce patrol and restoration times by nearly 40% in 2020. We were also able to improve our notification accuracy for impacted customers in advance of the PSPS events from levels below 90% in 2019 to 99.5% in 2020. This was enabled through the deployment of an innovative records and information management integration platform where we are partnering with Palantir to quickly and seamlessly consolidate data for our electric assets and customers from separate and disparate data sets. This has been a game changer for us and we're expanding this technology solution to serve as the core enabling technology for building our centralized data systems, bringing together physical, operational, lifecycle and environmental data elements to drive data informed decisions for our wildfire mitigation programs and beyond. The substantial improvements in 2020 over 2019 in our PSPS event implementation were noticed by many, and yet, we are still dissatisfied. And we've already begun implementing improvements for our 2021 Wildfire Mitigation and PSPS programs. In fact, during my first few weeks on the job, I had the opportunity to see the team in action during a very unusual January PSPS event. The team quickly sprang into action, enabling a cross functional focus on an end-to-end process. I saw our emergency response playbook in action, and it was good. The strong gusty winds we forecasted and our assessment of the dry fuels and potential fire spread risk in localized areas of our service territory, led us to shut off power to keep our customers safe, while the dangerous weather passed. Let me be clear about this point. The goal is to prevent damage and destruction from our equipment. And we'll choose to protect our customers and our communities even when that means utilizing PSPS. I was impressed that we have the technology to pinpoint our highest risk areas and target the specific sections of our system to prevent potential wildfires that would hurt people. Now moving into 2021, we will embrace the triple bottom line mindset of serving people, our planet and California's prosperity. This mindset will find an intersection between the need to safely deliver energy and meet the clean energy aspirations of Californians. I'm optimistic that there is a bright path forward with a triple bottom line enabled by a laser like focus on performance. Here are my initial observations and priorities to get us moving as we start 2021. We have a best-in-class emergency response playbook. And we're going to complement that by writing the PG&E clear sky playbook. So, we can predictably deliver every day, not just during and after a crisis. I'm putting together a team of senior leaders that's developing that clear sky playbook underpinned by a lean operating system that predictably delivers on our commitments and outcomes. We're bringing the best of a functional organizational design, standard, processes and scale to deliver a regionalized hometown experience for the communities and customers we serve. And finally, our system requires substantial capital investment and our customers deserve more discipline cost performance. We'll adopt better processes that improve our safety, quality, delivery and cost. Our work will deliver for customers and our investors. On my first day at PG&E, I went to Paradise in Butte County, to see the devastation caused from wildfires. I met with my co-workers who live in the community whose own lives were forever impacted by the Camp Fire. We're so grateful to those who have the strength and the courage to represent PG&E through the rebuilding efforts. When I reflect on when PG&E first developed our skills in disaster response, I go back to San Bruno. I visited the city of San Bruno a couple weeks ago, and I met with our co-workers who served their community there. They express the disappointment they felt that day and the helplessness of not being the heroes for the very first time. It was frustrating not being able to deliver as our Bluecrew strives to do delivering an essential service safely to our customers every day. PG&E has learned to respond to the challenges of emergencies and have developed a world class playbook for emergency response. My passion is to capture that capability and focus to establish a clear sky playbook. Playbook to deliver disaster prevention, the basics of the building blocks for a safe, reliable, affordable, clean and resilient system. [Indiscernible] before processes that cause delays and leave our frontline teams having to explain to customers why we can't deliver as promised, our daily performance is sometimes a mystery to the organization. We learn about issues when the customer tenaciously escalates their frustrations and then we jump to respond. We must enable our co-workers in the field to become problem preventers and solvers, not victims of poor processes. Improving the reliability of our day-to-day work will move us away from being just an emergency response company we need and we'll implement a clear sky lean operating system to effectuate this change, because it works. We're assembling the team to do just that. Adam Wright is our new Chief Operating Officer. Adam joins PG&E after serving for 18 years at Berkshire Hathaway and for the past three years as President and CEO of MidAmerican Energy. Adam brings a strong track record of operational performance at Mid-American and he'll focus on safety, standardizing practices and promoting excellent execution across the board. Adam's hand on approach has already started to show its value. I love how he leads with his heart and his mind. We need that. Marlene Santos is our new Chief Customer Officer. Marlene joins us after an impressive career at NextEra Energy, most recently serving as President of Gulf Power. Marlene led the integration effort of the acquisition of Gulf Power, and she was able to deploy a best-in-class operating system to a new organization which delivered meaningful results for the customers of Gulf Power. We're counting on Marlene to help us do the same here at PG&E. Julius Cox is our Chief Human Resources Officer and leader of our Shared Services and Supply Chain, a team charged with ensuring PG&E has the people, skills, resources and tools to meet customers' expectation. Prior to joining PG&E, Julius served as Chief Human Resource Officer AEP and Chief Transformation Officer at Dynegy. Joe Foreline, is our new SVP of Gas Operations. Joe joins PG&E after 35 years at PSEG, serving most recently as Vice President of Gas Operations and prior to that as Vice President of Customer Solutions. We're really excited for Joe to leverage his experience to enhance our focus on both gas operations and customer service. This team is coming for the mission and more are on their way. They all had great jobs and they were not looking to leave. I call them each and they answered the call to serve. These clear eyes and fresh legs, combined with the 25000 dedicated, resilient and smart PG&Eneers that I found here, will be the necessary ingredients to turn this company into a winning team. We're focusing on meeting and exceeding the expectations of those we are privileged to serve, our friends, our families and our neighbors. The new team will establish a regionalized daily heartbeat, that puts decision making where it belongs, closest to our customers and communities. I visited crews in many areas across our service area and the themes are clear, we're showing up in our home towns like a big company with a big company bureaucracy, and that needs to change. There are advantages to the scale of a big company, and we'll leverage them to the best of functional expertise, high quality standards, and that will be delivered by our regional cross-functional teams. Our customers don't need to feel that big company mindset, they need to feel like their hometown is the only one that matters. Our hometown team can deliver for them by being empowered to solve the problems they see with the cross-functional team on which they work. Our clear sky lean playbook will be essential in transforming our culture, our processes and our outcomes. Now, you might ask Patti, that all sounds great, but how will that deliver financial results? Well, this brings me to my final observation. We can accelerate the path to better financial health at PG&E by fixing the operational results we deliver. Our regulators, our legislators, our customers, my co-workers, and, yes, you, our investors can believe in PG&E again. Everyone can believe when we deliver, when we keep our promises, when we do what we say, we will do. There's a playbook for a great utility and we'll be writing ours here at PG&E. More to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris. Thank you, Chris. The path to reestablish PG&E is simple, the implementation is our challenge, will meet the challenge and here's how. We have a best-in-class emergency response playbook and we'll build on it by writing the PG&E clear sky playbook. I'm putting together a team of senior leaders that are ready writing and implementing that lean playbook that can predictably deliver our commitments and our outcomes. We're building the best of centralized functions, standards, processes and scale and we'll deliver a regionalized hometown experience for the communities and customers we serve. And finally, our system requires substantial capital investment, and our customers deserve more discipline cost performance. We'll adopt better processes that improve our safety, quality, delivery and cost. As a result, our work will deliver for our customers and for our investors. These initial priorities are the steps on the path to a new era at PG&E, focused on people, planet, and prosperity with laser like focus on performance. Operator, please open the line for questions. Hey Julien, nice to hear your voice. Yeah, this is actually an area Julien that I'm pretty excited about. And I feel good about our ability to build a transparent system. So, anybody and anyone who wants to can be aware of the status of our wildfire mitigation plans, it's a perfect application of our clear sky playbook is to prepare and prevent disaster. And so, we're actually leveraging our lean playbook, we've got four basic plays, and we're going to apply them to our wildfire mitigation plan. We're actually in the process, we've already initiated building out a control center at our San Ramon facility, where we'll be able to observe the progress, monitor problem, solve, establish standards, continuously improve. I am finding, we've got some incredibly talented people here, they just need a process, we need a system to make visible our commitments. And that enables us to make and meet our commitments. And so, the work that we're going to do, I think, will give the commission the visibility that they need. We welcome their partnership. We welcome their oversight, the policymakers have a lot at stake with our success. And they've shared that with me. And so, our job is to make it easy for them to regulate us, easy for them to monitor us. Because I can tell you this, no one's going to be looking closer at us than us. And so, we're going to be watching our performance. And we're going to be utilizing our clear sky playbook to do just that. And that should make those filings and that process much more streamlined, Julien. Thank you. Good morning, Steve. That's of course is embedded, and that's what made us feel pretty confident about our forward look on EPS, and shifting today, EPS oriented long-term growth target. But Chris, why don't you add a couple points on that? Yeah, Steve, we have not had official notification or close out of the letter that was sent at the end of last year on enhanced enforcement. So, honestly, Steve, I don't think we'd be surprised if that action happened. The first step is just a corrective action plan. And frankly, that's what we're building out. We've been working very closely with the wildfire staff at the commission to make sure that our plans meet expectations. But it's certainly within the realm of possibility that the commission might take that step. And frankly, we welcome it. I don't see that as a bad thing, Steve. It all comes down to this. Look, we've got to do what we said we're going to do. Our plan for 2021 wildfire mitigation is good. It has enhanced over 2020. 2020 was better than 2019. We're using more technology, we're doing more fire prevention with our enhanced vegetation management, with our better visibility. We're using technology tools that are honestly impressive. I'm impressed by them. And we're reducing the impact PSPS events. So, all of that being said, we have confidence in our plan. We welcome additional oversight. I wouldn't be concerned if additional oversight and the enhanced enforcement was initiated because the commission has a job to do. And we welcome the visibility. And as I said, we're building out our lean operating system to really drive home the performance of that wildfire mitigation plan, and it'll provide all the visibility and transparency that's required. Thanks, Steve. That's a great question. One of the things that excites me, is this team I'm building, in addition to very impressive talent I'm finding here at PG&E, we're going to have the best of the best influencing this playbook. So certainly, people know that I have a lean orientation and lots of experience. So, I have a point of view on this matter. But we're hiring some really talented people. Marlene Santos is going to bring a playbook. And so, trust me, we're going to lean into that next era playbook of Marlene's. Berkshire Hathaway has a playbook and Adam brings that with them. And so, we will be looking for the best of the best lean operating system that matches the PG&E needs and addresses what we need to address here most. But I will say the basic plays of our lean operating system will include visual management, operating reviews, problem solving and standards. It's clear to me and my - already and just the two months I've been here that those plays are essential to us being able to keep our promises and do what we say we're going to do. And so, the kind of the framework of the playbook is written. But we'll have the best of the best, certainly adding to that playbook and making sure that it reflects the specific needs of the PG&E team. So, in terms of, on your question on timing, we expect to have the fundamentals of the playbook written by midyear. But we'll be always continually updating and improving our playbook. But that's the spirit of lean operating system, we're never going to be satisfied. Right. We could have best ever performance and still be dissatisfied. And so, that playbook will ever be an evolution. And so, I wouldn't suggest that there's a finish line to it, but we will be getting better every day. Well, I'll hone in on the work. And I'll let Chris weigh in just a second on the financial implications. But the work itself, the big change for 2021 over 2020 is the risk orientation of the plan. 2020, we've got a lot of work done, we did a lot of vegetation management and system hardening. But it was more based on volume of work. And what we're transitioning in 2021 to which I think will really meet the needs of both the system and certainly a lot of the observers that we have is that we're transitioning to a risk prioritized system. And so, it's really important that we prioritize the work that we're doing to maximize the amount of risk we reduce every single year. And so, we're targeting a 20% reduction of the highest risk areas of the system. And so, we're going to be focused on that as well as additional technology, additional weather stations, additional cameras, our weather meteorology system is really very advanced, and we're going to continue to advance it. And so, more to come on all on the work. And that's a big change for 2021 but in terms of the financials, I'll turn it over to Chris. Good morning Jonathan. I'm sorry, Jonathan, can you repeat your question? Thank you. No, we're not done. There's more to come. And I think you'll like what you see. We still have an engineering role, which we've highlighted as an important role, I think for PG&E, because we've spent so much time responding to crisis, that I think there's been a loss of the ability to focus on the horizon, to get focused on the future of the clean energy transformation and how that clean energy transformation overlaps with the need for wildfire prevention. And I think, there's a really exciting opportunity where new technologies with the right engineering team can mitigate our multiple risks, supply shortages in the summer, wildfire mitigation, as well as our clean energy transformation. And so, we're definitely we've got some great names coming. I'm not going to, we've broken up news today. We'll be sharing the additional news here in the coming weeks of additional talent that's joining the team. Well, good morning. Thank you for asking the question. A couple of things. First, one thing I will share. As a newcomer to the California scene, I have been pleasantly surprised by the regulatory environment and the construct. I think, outside of California, I told myself things about what was true here and now that I am here. There's some really good components of our regulatory construct multiyear general rate cases with attrition adjustments. Many of you know that I have not - I have long advocated for annual filings, because you need flexibility and adjustment. But as I see the California construct, we have these long-term rate cases and filings and outcomes that provide long-term certainty to revenue. But we still have balancing accounts that allow for that flexibility to adjust and adapt as needs and conditions for our customers change. And I like that a lot. That's a good part of the construct, the decoupling the pass-throughs costs associated with commodity procurement. All of these elements make for a pretty solid regulatory construct, when we do what we said we would do. And so, it comes back to that whole thing. So, my wish list, Michael, truly is that we are reliable again, and our word stands. And so that's the focus of our efforts, it's the focus of our attention. Now, to your point about the long-term aspirations of policymakers here around clean energy and affordable energy. You may be aware that the commission held a non-bond event yesterday, and I was very optimistic about what I heard from that event. There's a real recognition that there's a risk that the entire clean energy transition, the cost of it is born in a residential electric bill. And that, in many ways is basically a regressive tax. Its tax policy borne out in electric bills. And the good news is, that was part of the conversation yesterday that we need to make sure that we have holistic cost sharing for the clean energy transition. And frankly, if we do our job, right, we can help reduce costs. And certainly, the unit cost of energy should go down as electrification takes hold both in buildings vehicles. So, I do think, if I had a wish list outside of my own wish list that we do what we say we're going to do, the rest of my wish list would be that we as California come together and find a holistic set of solutions that meet the expectations of our citizens. I find the ambitions inspiring, and we do it together as a state and that we don't finger point and sub optimize, but rather we work together to come for a great outcome, the best outcome for Californians, which frankly, then can be a role model for the rest of the world. Yep, thank you. Good morning, Jeremy. Well, first of all, a little shout out to all my friends at CMS. They know I love them. And I think about them all the time. I was compelled by the mission here at PG&E. And this is what I'm finding, both in the people who are here, the people who stayed, they say when the going gets tough, the tough get going. And this team has got going. I mean, this PG&E team that I have met is resilient and strong and they are here and they have stayed, and I'm proud of them and grateful for them for their endurance. The additional team members we're bringing along and the reason I am here is because we felt compelled by this cause that the people of California need PG&E to be strong. We need PG&E to have the capability to answer the call that the citizens and the policymakers are defining. And so, when I thought about both the citizens of California, and I thought about the people who work at PG&E, at the end of the day, Jeremy, I just couldn't turn away. And I think people know, I had a pretty good gig back there in Michigan. But to sit and not do my part, just didn't feel like an acceptable choice. So, I came out, and I'm happy to report again, that people are coming with me. And it's really, it's a mission worth serving. Now, I'll also say that it won't be the CMS playbook. It will be the PG&E playbook. We have to write our own based on the current conditions and needs of the system. And but the lean concepts are universal. And they weren't written at CMS, had they were written 100 years ago. Deming wrote some of the early fundamentals and lots of companies have implemented them. And I've seen it implemented well, and I've seen it implemented poorly. And we're going to implement it well. I do think my years of experience do bring visibility and perspective about what good looks like when we talk about a lean implementation. And so, the team and I here are writing that playbook. And we're going to implement it. And I'm highly confident that it will provide the certainty and the transparency and the ability to deliver outcomes, not just activity, but outcomes for the sake of the people that we serve. Thanks, Jeremy. Thanks, Jack. Well, thanks everyone for the discussion today. It really was good to be with all of you. We are looking forward to staying in touch in the coming months and certainly most importantly, restoring your trust and your confidence in the PG&E team. Thanks again for joining us today."

The presentation also includes the reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures and could be found online along with other information at investor.pgecorp.com. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that was filed with the SEC earlier today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there in our Q2, 10-Q and in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\nBill Smith: Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I cover the priorities for the quarter, I want to express our sympathy for all of those impacted by the devastating wildfires we\u2019ve experienced in California. It\u2019s been a history and very challenging wildfire season for our customers. We\u2019ve seen over 4 million acres burned in California with nearly 3 million acres burned in our service area. We thank the Governor\u2019s office, CAL FIRE, California Office of Emergency Services and all the first responders for their tireless efforts in keeping out new lease safe. We continue to focus on executing a series of important changes at PG&E. These changes will help us live up to the commitments made as a part of our chapter 11 emergency plan including our efforts to improve our operations and safety outcomes, reduce risk and enhance our customer focus. This morning I\u2019ll touch on three key areas of focus for PG&E. First, improvements to our wildfire mitigation plan; second, our operational updates and third, our executive leadership recruitment progress. Chris will then cover our financial updates and key regulatory cases. Looking at our wildfire mitigation plan, our highest priorities remain mitigating ignition risk, enhancing our situational awareness and implementing public safety power shutoff or PSPS advance. We will initiate these events when absolutely necessary to protect public safety. As you can see on slide 4, we continue to be on track or ahead of our 2020 targets for system hardening, enhanced vegetation management and installation of weather stations and high definition cameras. Our efforts over the last quarter have our weather station and camera installations back on track. We will respond -- judge all such request for information in the monitor report PG&E\u2019s unit vegetation management inspections next week share the monitoring the court's goals in ensuring we operate in a safe and reliable grid. While we acknowledge there are some areas where our comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan that we stood up in 2019 could improve, we do see some of the results somewhat differently than the letter provided by the monitor. We are unable to comment any further ahead of our response which will be filed on November 3rd. There is one aspect of the wildfire mitigation program that I'll give a detailed update on and that's our Public Safety Power Shutoff or PSPS program. We have done a lot since 2019 to increase cooperation with local authorities by hiring additional talent with emergency planning expertise. We also prioritize better communications with our customers this wildfire season. The technology improvements that will help us achieve our program goals are highlighted on slide 5. As we have in prior years, we'll continually evaluate conditions that include wind speed, humidity levels and fuels moisture among other factors. When conditions warrant we will implement power shut-offs as a last resort to keep our customers and communities safe. We have taken steps to minimize the impact of these events on our customers and we've executed five events so far this year. We have made our events smarter through leveraging technology, smaller by implementing sectionalizing devices as well as temporary generation and shorter by increasing our post event inspection capabilities. We've engaged with our communities and our customers to implement changes that incorporate their feedback while we have improved in 2020 versus 2019 in making these events less disruptive we continue to learn from each event. To make our program smarter we collect fuels moisture data and incorporate it into our fire spread modeling. This data is an important indicator along with wind speeds and assessing fire conditions in real time. We utilize the fuels data along with forecasting work we do in collaboration with the national weather service to determine where we need to implement a PSPS event. Our next priority to improve the program is to make the impacted customer footprint smaller. We have pre-positioned temporary generation in regions that are prone to shut-off events. We installed 600 sectionalizing devices which were in place by the end of August. In addition, we've added an Islanding configuration at the Humboldt Bay and Caribou generating stations which allow almost 70,000 customers to stay online. Those customers would have been shut-off in 2019. This one example of how we've implemented lessons learned from previous wildfire season. These actions allowed us to meet our goal of the one-third reduction in customers impacted in our first events. In order to make outages shorter we've increased our aerial patrol abilities through additional helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. We now have access to more than 60 helicopters to help us meet our goal of a 50% faster restoration time versus 2019. I'd like to touch on a couple of other areas of PSPS implementation where we've increased our focus in 2020. This includes our coordination with county and city emergency managers and our outreach to customers. In December, we started holding town hall listening sessions with city managers, first responders and residents. At these sessions PG&E senior leaders listened to the local stakeholders and started working on plans to improve coordination for the 2020 PSPS events. Our team then held subsequent discussions where we worked through local plans for these events based on the information we learned in the listening sessions. As an example of change made resulting from these listening sessions, we increased the local presence of PG&E personnel who coordinate with emergency managers. These important employees serve as a single point of contact for individual counties and cities during a power shutoff event. On the customer side, we've also made significant changes in response to lessons learned in 2019. We conducted webinars focused on wildfire safety initiatives in the counties we serve. We ask questions and receive valuable feedback which we've used to address the concerns and needs of our customers on a county by county basis. We've worked hard on three specific areas related to customer engagement during PSPS events. The first is our notification system. The second is our website and the third is customer resources provided by PG&E. With regard to our notification system we work to notify customers with an initial watch notification message as early as 48 hours prior to event. The PSPS watch will be upgraded to a warning when forecasted conditions show that a safety shutoff will be necessary. Warning notifications are sent approximately 4 to 12 hours in advance of an event. These messages also include an expected restoration time. Outage and restoration information is updated throughout the event. We improved our messaging and direct response to customers\u2019 feedback from last year. Second, on our website improvements we have moved pge.com from our data centers to the cloud where we tested the site to levels well beyond the demand we saw during our peak usage in 2019. Our enhanced web capability allows for customers to look up shutoff times and estimated restoration times by address. This information is available as early as two days before an event occurs. Also, we increased the number of our community resource centers during PSPS events. In our first event this year we had 50 community resource centers available for analogy impacting 172,000 customers. By comparison in 2019 we had 80 centers for 1 million customers impacted. These centers provide a place for customers to go during power shutoffs and are equipped with charging stations, bottled water and other necessities. All of these locations comply with COVID safety protocols. We expect to have incremental opportunities to leverage technology to improve our wildfire mitigation plans and our PSPS implementation. We continue to incorporate feedback from our community leaders and our customers to improve these events. With respect to updates and next steps on wildfire filings, as we indicated before we anticipate a decision on our safety certification request at the CPUC by the end of this month. We believe, we provided all the necessary information and we hope to see that outcome any day now. As a reminder the prior certification we received last year remains in place. Looking forward, we will take the learnings from our wildfire mitigation plans as well as our PSPS adjustments and will reflect them in our 2021 wildfire mitigation plan filing. Last week the wildfire safety division gave all three IOUs a February deadline for that submission. One additional note on operations we were notified earlier in the month that Cal fire has taken possession of PG&E equipment as a part of their ongoing investigation into the cause of the Zogg fire which was west of Redding, California. Given the early stage of the investigation and the fact that we haven't had an opportunity to review the assets retained by CAL FIRE there is limited additional information to provide today. We are fully cooperating with CAL FIRE in its investigation and will provide more information on the Zogg fire at the appropriate time. In addition on Monday we filed a response to Judge Alsup's request for information on the Zogg fire. We will not comment any further as to we do not want to get ahead of the CAL FIRE investigation. While our electric operations are certainly an area of focus given our effort to mitigate wildfire risk I also want to highlight the continued good work done by our gas operations team. One of the major initiatives to make our gas system safer is to enable in-line inspections. This method is preferable to traditional hydrostatic testing in a couple of ways. It eliminates the need for a line to be taken out of service for testing and it's safer than hydrostatic testing which can compromise the strength of the pipe. In terms of day-to-day operations our gas odor average response times and our third-party dig-in rates are at the upper end of industry standards. These are two areas of focus to ensure we provide safe and reliable gas delivery. I want to mention two facilities that we opened in 2017 that have helped us improve our gas operations. These centers were opened in direct response to comprehensive evaluation of our operations. First, in 2017 we opened the center for gas safety which has expansive lab space that allows us to test new technologies. Second, we opened our gas safety academy. Here we offer gas operations team a training space that simulates various gas emergencies we encounter in our territory. These two centers were open to ensure that we have given our operations team the necessary technology and training facilities to drive continuous improvement. We will look to the practices we have implemented our gas business and our wild fire mitigation efforts to continue to inform our path forward while we accomplished a lot in increasing safety and reducing risk we continue to work hard to improve. The last item I'd like to cover is the progress we're making on open executive leadership roles. We remain on track to name a new CEO as well as a President Utility by the end of the year. We've also kicked off a national search for a CFO. All three of these key singular leadership searches are being supported by the same firm that will help with the alignment of abilities and backgrounds. We are fortunate to have Chris Foster taking the lead as interim CFO. Chris is leading a very strong finance department while we conduct our search for a permanent CFO. These leaders will build off a few recent hires that are very exciting. Those include Francisco Benavides our Chief Safety Officer, Sumeet Singh our Chief Risk Officer and Ajay Waghray as our Chief Information Officer. These three recent additions to the PG&E team reflect our commitment to change. We will continue to operate with a focus on safety and risk while continuously looking for new ways to implement technology to increase efficiency. To build on that a bit, I'd like to share a recent initiative that we've kicked off. We are taking a focused look at our operations. We will look to operate more efficiently and improve our relationship with our customers by creating an enterprise approach to asset management adopting consistent work management practices and implementing tools to measure track and monitor our customer experience. We'll have more to share on this initiative as we move into 2021. In closing I want to express my appreciation for all PG&E frontline employees. Our employees are navigating a difficult operating environment and they continue to execute on safety risk reduction and reliability programs across electric and gas systems. With that I'll turn it over to Chris to cover our financials and some key regulatory cases. Chris?\nChris Foster: Thank you Bill and good morning everyone. I plan on covering four items which are highlighted as the key takeaways on 53. First we are on track and reaffirming the five-year earnings guidance we set last quarter. This is reflective of the consistent growth we anticipate over the coming years. Second, I'll provide an update on our insurance coverage, the impact of COVID and our financing needs. Third, I'll highlight meaningful progress on our regulatory cases that provide additional revenue clarity. Lastly, I'll briefly cover the third quarter results. Starting with our earnings guidance elements, they're highlighted on slide 10. We've updated our GAAP earnings guidance range slightly for 2020 to reflect a loss between $1 and $1.06 per share. We are reaffirming non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance as well as our earnings factors for both 2020 and 2021. Specifically in 2020, we are guiding to non-GAAP core earnings of $2 billion for the year or approximately a $1.62 - $1.63 per share. This is based on weighted average shares of roughly 1.25 billion in 2020. The drivers of variants from earning our authorized return remain unchanged. Also noted here are the key assumptions underlying 2020 guidance. This includes receiving a final decision in the 2020 general rate case in the fourth quarter. Our guidance is also consistent with the TO20 formula rate settlement and assumes Fed\u2019s approval of our separate AFUDC waiver request reflected in this settlement in the fourth quarter. I'll come back to these regulatory items to provide more color. Moving to non-core earnings guidance which is broken out on the same slide. We've made a couple of adjustments to these items. Our range for bankruptcy and legal costs increased $30 million to the range of $2.66 billion to $2.7 billion. The increase to the range reflects a final adjustment required to the fair value of the equity backstop fee based on the share price at the beginning of July. Additionally, for investigation remedies and cost recovery we have lowered the forecasted spend from $300 million to $230 million for the year. Roughly 30 million of this decrease is permanent and we will apply it towards the wildfire OII spend requirement. The remaining difference is timing items that will impact 2021 non-core spend. We have increased the guidance for 2019 10-K fire related costs by $20 million to approximately $170 million for the year. During the third quarter, we received information from potential claimants including insurance segregation claims that led to an increase in our accrual from $600 million to $625 million pre-tax. As it relates to the concave fire, we continue to not have access to Cal fire's investigative report or the evidence they have collected. We've also included a pickup of $50 million for the category prior period net regulatory recoveries. This category includes three items. First, we've included revenues related to the 2011 GTS capital audit consistent with previous guidance. This quarter we've also added a pickup for the 2019 impact of our modified AFUDC filing partially offsetting the first two items are prior year revenue reductions that are associated with FERC's recent order on TO18 and the TO20 settlement now pending with FERC. Our full year guidance for the amortization of the wildfire fund contribution remains the same. Moving to 2021 guidance on slide 11. We continue to see non-GAAP core earnings of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion for the year or approximately $0.95 to a $1.05 per share. This non-GAAP core earnings target is $275 million to $425 million below our authorized levels. This range is mostly comprised of interest expense of $275 million to $325 million. Additionally, net below the line and spend above authorized will taper off as we carry out additional efficiency measures. This includes revisiting contracted work such as contracts for wildfire mitigation and brings us to our range of $0 million to $100 million there. Next I'll cover updates on our non-core asset sales, insurance coverage and the impact of COVID-19 and the effect of these items on our financing needs. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we are considering selling a set of small non-core assets. We remain early in the process there, but we have made some progress on that front. If successful in 2021, the impacts from such a transaction could reduce the high end of our $450 million to $750 million forecasted equity range for the year. We've also filed an application with the CPUC for approval to sell our San Francisco office complex fulfilling the commitment we set out in our plan every organization. Based on an illustrated sale price of $1 billion shown in our application a benefit of $600 million would flow back to customers. We are looking at 2021 for the likely timing of the sale.  Moving to our wildfire insurance. We have made progress in accessing over $100 million of additional coverage since the second quarter. That puts the wildfire liability insurance component of our overall insurance portfolio at up to $868 million in coverage for the period. With regard to the impact of COVID-19, we continue to experience higher uncollectible costs during the year as well as incremental operating costs. Roughly $90 million has been recorded to memorandum accounts created to track code related costs for collection in future periods. When combining the impact of higher insurance costs, the timing of the general building office sale and the timing of recovery for COVID-19 costs, we foresee a short-term cash needing the fourth quarter that we anticipate will be met with short-term debt. We do not see these items changing our equity needs. I will now shift to covering a few significant updates on the regulatory front. We've made progress in a few areas that keep us on the path to achieving the guidance ranges we set out last quarter. I'll start with FERC. Two weeks ago, we filed a settlement in the transmission owner 2020 rate case that is subject to approval by FERC. We are pleased with the outcome and the support of the broad set of settling parties. There are few elements to the settlement that I'll highlight. First we establish an all-in return on equity of 10.45% and a capital structure that is 49.75% equity. These factors remain in place through 2023. The settlement establishes our first formula rate case that brings clarity with the annual expense throughout process and additionally the settlement outlines a modified AFUDC waiver filing with FERC that if approved will allow us to apply a higher equity ratio on AFUDC back to May of 2019. That is being reviewed by FERC staff on a separate track and we assume completion of that review by the end of Q4. I'll now shift to the cases of the CPUC. Last week we received a proposed decision on our 2020 generate case. The outcome is largely similar to the multi-party settlement released we reached last December and does not impact our 2020 or 2021 earnings guidance. The total $9.1 billion revenue requirement was unchanged. The proposed decision does include changes to the cost recovery process for liability insurance, vegetation management and wildfire mitigation capital and expense. Specifically the proposed decision would require us to file separate applications for the recovery of costs above 130% of the authorized amount. It also proposed reductions to the authorized wildfire mitigation capital costs. These are considered (\"AB\") 1054 related capital spend and are at the magnitude of roughly $900 million over two years. These amounts were already excluded from our rate based forecast so we do not anticipate a change in our rate based projection. The timing of this proposed decision should keep us on track for a final decision by the end of the year which aligns well with the previous statutory deadline of December 13th set forth by the CPUC in June. We've also sought recovery for roughly $1.3 billion of 2017 through 2019 costs through our recent wildfire mitigation and catastrophic events or WMCE filing at the CPUC. Related to these costs we received a decision in our SEMA case last week that allows us to recover roughly $450 million beginning in December. Now the wildfire mitigation catastrophic events or WMCE filings becomes the path to recover the remaining costs. On our securitization filing, hearings begin in December at the CPUC and based on the procedural schedule we anticipate the case could wrap up in the second quarter of 2021 with a securitized debt offering closely following. We will also be separately preparing our (\"AB\") 1054 related securitization filing after we receive the final decision in the 2020 generate case. Looking forward a last area I'd like to touch on due to the broad public policy focus in California is vehicle electrification. The transportation sector remains the largest emitter of greenhouse gases accounting for roughly 40% of the total for the state. So the need for emission reductions in this sector is as part of meeting our statewide carbon reduction goals is clear. Our customers\u2019 excitement for electric vehicles continues to be reflected in consistent adoption levels. More than 300,000 electric vehicles plug into PG&E's grid representing one out of every five electric vehicles nationwide and we see additional growth due to the increasingly competitive space among OEMs. Our current CPUC approved EV charging infrastructure portfolio is one of the largest of any utility in the United States. At this time, we have installed roughly 3,500 ports as part of our phase one for electric vehicle charge network filing at the CPUC and as an indicator of our customers\u2019 interest this program is more than three times oversubscribed. The Governor recently issued an executive order for zero emission passenger vehicles by 2035 and medium heavy duty vehicles by 2045 and in support of the state's clean energy goals we anticipate submitting a 10-year transportation liferification plan by early 2022.  Now I'd like to transition to our third quarter financial result. Slide 13 shows our results for the third quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the year came in at $1.6 billion and is consistent with our full year guidance. GAAP earnings including non-core items are also shown here. The non-core items are consistent with the full year 2020 guidance I mentioned. Moving on slide 14 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $590 million or $1.11 in the third quarter of last year and $461 million or $0.22 this year. The primary drivers were an increase in shares outstanding from our July 1st equity rate interest expense as well as two timing items that are each expected to reverse. The first is the 2020 generate case costs recovery and second is the timing of taxes. With the full quarter behind us after the bankruptcy, we're now very focused on executing well on the operational and financial plan we set out. We have a strong earnings projection ahead of us that are supported by regulatory outcomes that I discussed and we are excited for the long-term opportunities provided from our state's focus on clean energy technology. With that operator could you please open the lines for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes to the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Byrd your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is open. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning. Can you hear me now? \nBill Smith: Yes we can hear you Julien. Good morning.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Thank you. So perhaps if I can go back here thank you for all the details, can we talk about the wildfire certification process and just your expectations here? I mean clearly both of your peers have it, certainly you had articulated some forthcoming deadlines here on obtaining it. Any specific context that you would provide to us and thinking about nuances as to delays or otherwise as to the process itself just given where we stand today and have a follow-up?\nChris Foster: Sure Julien. No problem. Again I think as Bill laidout, we have filed all the information that we think is relevant that the commission was seeking at this stage. We filed that on July 29th. So we do still anticipate a decision from the commission by the end of the month. What I would offer just in terms of context around it because I think there's been a little bit of confusion is maybe a couple ways to think about it. First it's important to keep in mind that while the commission's -- that decision the prior safety certificate remains in place. If we run into a scenario where the commission were not to approve you'd have a couple of things occurring. First we would have the ability to continue to have access to the AB 1054 wildfire fund but we would lose the protections of the shareholder liability cap and the improved prudency construct. So just wanted to provide that. We don't anticipate that being the outcome Julien, but I just wanted to provide that as a way for to help you think about what the other scenario could look like.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Excellent. Thank you. If I can go back can you talk a little bit about the scenarios here with the Zogg fire, I know it's difficult to speak to it at this point in time but can you speak a little bit to the context and the decision making around PSPS and I know you all provided this context earlier but can you give a little bit more as to the events as to why you did not engage in PSPSP in that specific context there? Again how that fits into the certification framework as well?\nChris Foster: Sure Julien. This is Chris. I think the safety certificate we would consider largely separate and apart. There was a fairly straightforward set of criteria that the commission was evaluating as it related to the certificate itself. If you look at the situation in terms of the data points around the Zogg fire, there were three different weather stations that were in the general vicinity which is what we shared with Judge Alsup in our filing this week and there I think what you saw is generally speaking the sustained winds were roughly 15 miles per hour in that area with gusts at certain publicly owned weather stations at up to around I think 32 miles an hour. That deviates from what we have in terms of our own planning. As you know our public safety power shutoff approach consists of a number of different considerations from relative humidity to the moisture in the fuels in the ground to wind speeds as well. The wind speeds in those areas did not meet the general requirements that we have in place. You could consider those as roughly 25 miles per hour in terms of sustained winds and generally speaking an exceedance of 45 miles per hour in terms of purposes when we typically consider shutting off an area that customers are being served by.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Thank you for that clarification. Lastly, sorry for another one but if I can squeeze it in just on insurance I obviously the market is dynamic. You've obtained more here. Going forward in the next year what are your options around different avenues here if you can just elaborate very quickly the intent of which that it may not necessarily perpetuate as it has this year?\nChris Foster: Sure. I guess I would start with I have to acknowledge it's been a pretty dramatic year as Bill talked about in terms of statewide impacts from the August heat, storm, fires and other elements. So it's obviously Julian the market's going to continue to evolve I think from a cost recovery standpoint we do think that we have achieved what is reasonable in terms of insurance coverage before this year. In terms of next year, I think there are probably a few things at play. Our understanding as we read the statute is that AB 1054 does contemplate the wildfire safety administrator the entity that oversees the wildfire fund to contemplate a level of coverage for the industrial utilities in the state. Absent any kind of explicit guidance there we'd be looking at it next year to determine what would be the most cost effective coverage options for our customers everything from multi-year plan components, some different structures to the insurance itself as well as certainly trying to compete as best we can for the best price possible for customers. So at this stage for this year, we do have a total of a billion five in comprehensive coverage, 868 million of that is for wildfire coverage at a total cost of the one five which comes to roughly $ 860 million.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for that. Appreciate all the time. \nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \nSteve Fleishman: Hi, excuse me, good morning. Just I guess a question on the fire victim fund. Have you gotten any indication from them on their intentions in terms of the shares they own and any plans for basically what the plans are for those shares going forward?\nBill Smith: Hi, good morning Steve. We haven't at this point. What you'll see in our queue is that we did point out that as of October 20th the information the company has is that the trust has not sold any shares. So that really is the update on that for. I think at this stage obviously given the fire victims trust is a substantial shareholder of the company we do our best to communicate openly with them as well to help make sure that they're aware of events around the company but at this stage can't really speculate on how they're thinking about share issuances in the future.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Can you clarify whether they were blacked out at all or anything or just not?\nChris Foster: No, sure Steve, I think it's a fair question the dynamics there that you should think about going forward are that the registration rights agreement that we do have with the trust provides for blackout periods some demand rights provisions and other things but largely those attributes would not be really in the public domain. Those would be exchanges of information between the company and the fire victims\u2019 trust. Certainly at this stage our interests are very aligned and so we would want to collaborate with the trust as appropriate should they undertake an unwritten offering.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, second question just and this is I don't know how well you can answer this but we've had a lot of events this season and you've done several PSPS and obviously most of them work very well. We do have this Zogg event, but then a lot of successful events in terms of avoiding issues. So could you, is there any color you can give on just kind of political regulatory feedback you're getting on your activities so far?\nBill Smith: Hi Steve. This is Bill Smith. Thanks for the question. I think that generally speaking people understand the nature of the challenge that we are facing and feedback has been relatively good from our key stakeholders. No one likes to see us have to do this, but I've seen in fact some articles that kind of recognize that this is about public safety and I think as unfortunate as this season has been if you look at the early part of the season and the number of wildfires we had that had, nothing to do with utilities of any kind I think it showed the public in general that this is a much broader issue than PG&E. And I think the state of California has said something approaching 9,000 fires so far this year. So I think there's a better acceptance this year of the nature of the challenge. We've been getting some pretty good feedback from all the key stakeholders that were executing well and I would like to say that in the events that we've had this year while we're still doing some of the final tallies from this latest event. But there have been well over a hundred cases where we found debris and other things into our lines that had we not taken the proactive steps to implement a PSPS could have or would have likely started a fire. So I think that obviously you point out the Zogg issue we've got to learn more about that but I would say generally speaking what we're doing is working and I think people appreciate that it's for their safety and the safety of the communities.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Just one last quick one, just on the management hires that you're working on. I know can't probably give specifics but just given that these are obviously three very important roles, could you give us some color on the types of people you're looking at for these different roles or at least are we going to know these people any color there would be helpful?\nBill Smith: Yes. Well without giving any detailed specifics, I think what I would say is we're looking for people with experience and a strong commitment to safety and operational effectiveness and basically operational excellence. So I'm really pleased at how that whole process is coming along. So just stay tuned, but it's come along quite well and very much according to our plan.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Your line is open. \nJonathan Arnold: Hi good morning guys. Quick question on the TO20 and just sort of how to think about this going forward. I see it looks from the slides as though you're sticking with the rule of thumb sort of guidance modeling assume the CPUC cap structure and return across the end. But one feature of the settlement here is that you're getting to learn on this hypothetical cap structure. So sort of curious whether there is some sort of help embedded within there versus how you were suggesting we approached this before or whether it could have fit just within the general tolerance?\nChris Foster: It's consistent Jonathan. Thanks for the question. I know that the TO20 case has some unique elements to it but at this stage the way, the thing that I would focus on is the assumption that we've called out. If you specifically look at our 2020 factors I think you'd want to focus on the AFUDC waiver because that's the piece at this stage. The other elements are fairly straightforward they're not changing relative to where we were before you. You'd want the AFUDC waiver piece to be handled by the FERC accounting staff reasonably and a general way to think about that if it's helpful Jonathan is you'd probably be looking at a $0.03 swing roughly depending on how that turns out but our assumption as we call out here implies that we think that we'll have that FERC accounting staff final view by the end of the year.\nJonathan Arnold: Actually I did want to follow up on that to understand that better. Does that have an ongoing earnings variance impact or it sounded like it might be more retroactive looking applying looking back but I'm not sure.\nChris Foster: It'd be looking back Jonathan.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. So that $0.03 you're talking about is just a swing factor in terms of what you would book as core earnings for 21 but ultimately doesn't really change the trajectory. Is that right? \nChris Foster: So just to be clear Jonathan, we called it out as an assumption in 2020 specifically so that's where we would anticipate the impact if it were to go in a different direction.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Without going in a different direction would that change the go forward earnings power or just impact with 2020? \nChris Foster: It would be an impact confined to 2020. \nJonathan Arnold: Okay. So that was it and I think just one thing on insurance I know you just gave us the total cost. Is there a data point on what you ended up paying for this incremental 100 million? \nChris Foster: No. There is not specifically Jonathan. I do appreciate the question because there's been quite a bit of focus on the wildfire component of the coverage itself. We haven't provided any additional color at this stage. I certainly imagine we'll continue that discussion at the CPUC as we examine cost recovery there at this stage. Again this overlaps with the 2020 generate case proposed decision that we have and we do hope the commission ultimately in their final decision could land at the place where in the language that's reflected in our settlement agreement.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Thank you very much Chris. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. \nMichael Lapides: Hi guys thank you for taking my question. Chris this one's probably for you, just curious there are lots of items that won't necessarily have a direct income statement impact but could lead to significant sources of cash inflow in the FEMA and [indiscernible] can you just walk us through those a little bit because some of these are starting to get pretty material and I'm just trying to think about things that would be kind of cash inflows for 2021/2022 that may be more cash flow statement versus income state drive stable drivers?\nChris Foster: Sure Michael. Good morning. I think if you look at it we call them out as well in our disclosures in the queue, but the way I think about it is you have multiple different memorandum accounts that have been stacking up. I want to say it's I could be off on this number. So I'm going to be generic, but I think it was roughly in the neighborhood to $2.5 billion to $3 billion having been building up. So I think that's where your focus is. Ultimately if you step back though these cost recovery mechanisms and the memorandum accounts are something we've been planning around for a few quarters. So I wouldn't think about it as implying there's any kind of change of the financing plan that sits behind it to support it because I think ultimately if you really start with FEMA for example, it's been a fairly straightforward cost recovery mechanism for the company for years. We were pleased to see that the interim rate relief request came through that accelerated some of those recoveries Michael, but otherwise as you see those broken out we would contemplate that traditional regulatory lag that exists for Californians that wouldn't necessarily be impacting any kind of future financing.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then last item can you guys think about the bill, what\u2019s going to happen customer bill over the next couple years. Can you talk just directionally what do you think the level of bill in place of inflation you anticipate over the next three to four years three to five years could you look at your plan?\nChris Foster: Sure. So stepping back a bit Michael I think it's a good question. We have substantial investments needed to mitigate wildfire risk. But in terms of the company's plan it's actually pretty straightforward. We have the combination of the GTNF, our cost of capital proceeding, the generate case and now that the TO20 case which really gives us a pretty good line of sight to what that's going to look like at least for the next three years and in most of those examples. As you start to look at that kind of three to five year range we're generally speaking looking at roughly four to just north of 4% average electric system bundled average rate impacts for our customers that puts us generally speaking in line with growth projections in our state. We are very fortunate to serve the area that we do and the economic diversity that exists here and I think there's another way we look at it as you can imagine as well. We also contemplate these growth rates as it relates to a percent of share of wallet for customers. We acknowledge that our customer base is very different from customers who may live in the central valley of California to northern California and those in the more moderate temperate areas in the coastal communities and so that's the range that we're generally speaking looking at for the next few years.\nMichael Lapides: And finally are there any major cost savings areas where you think you could offset some of that bill inflation? \nBill Smith: Thanks. This is Bill. I think there are a lot of areas. I wouldn't say there's a given major place, but there are a lot of opportunities that we think that we can do from taking approach to some of our contracting efforts. When we started after the events of 2017 and 2018, there was a very aggressive attempt to get as many resources on the ground as we could. I think there are ways for us to come back and look at that more effectively. I think one of the things I'm excited about is the point that I made about an issue that we're kicking off around some of our operational process improvements. I think there are ways that we can get much more effective at what we do, reduce lost time, take cycle time out which reduces inventory needs a lot of things. So I think it's a broad range of areas that can help us get costs out of the business not any one or two individual items.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciated. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes the line of Jeremy [indiscernible] from JP Morgan Security. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi good morning. This is Rich on for Jeremy. Thanks for taking our questions. Just want to start off with circling back on the prior question. Could you provide a little bit more call around these enterprise-wide initiatives that you alluded to earlier maybe the magnitude of the impact of COVID over the next few years and how this fits with sort of driving earnings versus offsetting customer rates?\nChris Foster: Sure Jeremy. So there's a few different ways to look at it. I think stepping back what I think, you're interested in and I want to be sure I'm responsible are kind of categories as a way to contemplate this. Some categories would be earnings impacting others would be more specific to benefits to customers. As we look forward to the next few years, some of those categories we've talked about include things like renewable energy credits. Anytime you look at kind of the energy side of the business in that way, we're always searching for savings to make sure that we're cost competitive on behalf of customers. So I think benefits that you would see there would accrue to customers. We also continue to evaluate additional surplus property assets largely similar treatment there in a number of those cases where if there's a developed area there. Many of those benefits would also accrue back to customers. You can imagine that conversation is really evolving in real time as we look at the COVID-19 impacts and how to think about the future state of kind of the footprint of the company. Obviously that's the case with our future move as well to Oakland and moving our primary headquarters there as well. As we think about some of these other elements of work process improvement that Bill alluded to, I think you could see a split there, but ultimately we see that as being a driver for us going forward in terms of achieving cost savings that will allow us to in the future earn our authorized return as we've guided to in 2022.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you and then just given the current focus on the elections right now can you provide any early thoughts around your financial plan and sensitive issue corporate tax rates increase?\nBill Smith: Sure. Thank you Rich. Sorry, it's limited in short because of the NOLs that the company has I think if should there be a change and should there be a substantial change in terms of tax policy I think for at least PG&E you'll see limited impacts there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you very much. \nBill Smith: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is open. \nRyan Levine: Good morning. Can you, sorry, what's the non-core assets the company is starting to sell and can you remind us the sharing mechanism between ratepayers and shareholders on the potential proceeds? Any more color your picture on it?\nChris Foster: Sure Ryan. I appreciate the question and I'm really not able to be much more forthcoming than that. I think it's what emphasized there and where we were really last quarter\u2019s we are really doing the internal work right now to evaluate some small non-core assets that we're evaluating. If you step back and just think about different what I'll call asset classes which are you can think about different asset classes in different ways. One of which is the land that the company owns the physical footprint that we have in different areas. Some of which is developed, some of which is not. Generally speaking the benefits of the crew from any sale will differ depending on that treatment as one example. As you look across other different asset classes there could be opportunities where the gain on sale treatment is slightly different and so at this stage we are very focused on this effort. I do think we can continue to make progress but don't want to be too specific because I don't want to get ahead of our internal work in any kind of outreach we'd otherwise be doing at a later stage. \nRyan Levine: Thanks and then changing gears what assumptions change that drove the higher estimate and given that you haven't received the Cal fire report are there any additional information changes that you're anticipating that we may see further revisions at this current estimate? \nBill Smith: Sure Ryan. So this is really just an element of time passage and us getting better information over time. At this stage what we had referenced, we're having conversations as you can imagine with some of the different entities and in particular what we noted were the segregation claims themselves we have better data than we had before as you recall with prior, as you may recall with prior wildfires in prior years the California office of insurance had disclosed a greater level of granularity which provided one means by which to have additional input. In this situation we have now improved data as it relates to the segregation claims in particular and that allowed us to update our accrual at this stage. \nRyan Levine: Okay. Thank you. \nBill Smith: Thank you. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. \nMatt Putnam: Well thank you all for your interest in PG&E and thank you for joining us on the call today. If you have any follow-up questions please don't hesitate to reach out to investor relations. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Foster",
            "content": "Thank you Bill and good morning everyone. I plan on covering four items which are highlighted as the key takeaways on 53. First we are on track and reaffirming the five-year earnings guidance we set last quarter. This is reflective of the consistent growth we anticipate over the coming years. Second, I'll provide an update on our insurance coverage, the impact of COVID and our financing needs. Third, I'll highlight meaningful progress on our regulatory cases that provide additional revenue clarity. Lastly, I'll briefly cover the third quarter results. Starting with our earnings guidance elements, they're highlighted on slide 10. We've updated our GAAP earnings guidance range slightly for 2020 to reflect a loss between $1 and $1.06 per share. We are reaffirming non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance as well as our earnings factors for both 2020 and 2021. Specifically in 2020, we are guiding to non-GAAP core earnings of $2 billion for the year or approximately a $1.62 - $1.63 per share. This is based on weighted average shares of roughly 1.25 billion in 2020. The drivers of variants from earning our authorized return remain unchanged. Also noted here are the key assumptions underlying 2020 guidance. This includes receiving a final decision in the 2020 general rate case in the fourth quarter. Our guidance is also consistent with the TO20 formula rate settlement and assumes Fed's approval of our separate AFUDC waiver request reflected in this settlement in the fourth quarter. I'll come back to these regulatory items to provide more color. Moving to non-core earnings guidance which is broken out on the same slide. We've made a couple of adjustments to these items. Our range for bankruptcy and legal costs increased $30 million to the range of $2.66 billion to $2.7 billion. The increase to the range reflects a final adjustment required to the fair value of the equity backstop fee based on the share price at the beginning of July. Additionally, for investigation remedies and cost recovery we have lowered the forecasted spend from $300 million to $230 million for the year. Roughly 30 million of this decrease is permanent and we will apply it towards the wildfire OII spend requirement. The remaining difference is timing items that will impact 2021 non-core spend. We have increased the guidance for 2019 10-K fire related costs by $20 million to approximately $170 million for the year. During the third quarter, we received information from potential claimants including insurance segregation claims that led to an increase in our accrual from $600 million to $625 million pre-tax. As it relates to the concave fire, we continue to not have access to Cal fire's investigative report or the evidence they have collected. We've also included a pickup of $50 million for the category prior period net regulatory recoveries. This category includes three items. First, we've included revenues related to the 2011 GTS capital audit consistent with previous guidance. This quarter we've also added a pickup for the 2019 impact of our modified AFUDC filing partially offsetting the first two items are prior year revenue reductions that are associated with FERC's recent order on TO18 and the TO20 settlement now pending with FERC. Our full year guidance for the amortization of the wildfire fund contribution remains the same. Moving to 2021 guidance on slide 11. We continue to see non-GAAP core earnings of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion for the year or approximately $0.95 to a $1.05 per share. This non-GAAP core earnings target is $275 million to $425 million below our authorized levels. This range is mostly comprised of interest expense of $275 million to $325 million. Additionally, net below the line and spend above authorized will taper off as we carry out additional efficiency measures. This includes revisiting contracted work such as contracts for wildfire mitigation and brings us to our range of $0 million to $100 million there. Next I'll cover updates on our non-core asset sales, insurance coverage and the impact of COVID-19 and the effect of these items on our financing needs. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we are considering selling a set of small non-core assets. We remain early in the process there, but we have made some progress on that front. If successful in 2021, the impacts from such a transaction could reduce the high end of our $450 million to $750 million forecasted equity range for the year. We've also filed an application with the CPUC for approval to sell our San Francisco office complex fulfilling the commitment we set out in our plan every organization. Based on an illustrated sale price of $1 billion shown in our application a benefit of $600 million would flow back to customers. We are looking at 2021 for the likely timing of the sale.  Moving to our wildfire insurance. We have made progress in accessing over $100 million of additional coverage since the second quarter. That puts the wildfire liability insurance component of our overall insurance portfolio at up to $868 million in coverage for the period. With regard to the impact of COVID-19, we continue to experience higher uncollectible costs during the year as well as incremental operating costs. Roughly $90 million has been recorded to memorandum accounts created to track code related costs for collection in future periods. When combining the impact of higher insurance costs, the timing of the general building office sale and the timing of recovery for COVID-19 costs, we foresee a short-term cash needing the fourth quarter that we anticipate will be met with short-term debt. We do not see these items changing our equity needs. I will now shift to covering a few significant updates on the regulatory front. We've made progress in a few areas that keep us on the path to achieving the guidance ranges we set out last quarter. I'll start with FERC. Two weeks ago, we filed a settlement in the transmission owner 2020 rate case that is subject to approval by FERC. We are pleased with the outcome and the support of the broad set of settling parties. There are few elements to the settlement that I'll highlight. First we establish an all-in return on equity of 10.45% and a capital structure that is 49.75% equity. These factors remain in place through 2023. The settlement establishes our first formula rate case that brings clarity with the annual expense throughout process and additionally the settlement outlines a modified AFUDC waiver filing with FERC that if approved will allow us to apply a higher equity ratio on AFUDC back to May of 2019. That is being reviewed by FERC staff on a separate track and we assume completion of that review by the end of Q4. I'll now shift to the cases of the CPUC. Last week we received a proposed decision on our 2020 generate case. The outcome is largely similar to the multi-party settlement released we reached last December and does not impact our 2020 or 2021 earnings guidance. The total $9.1 billion revenue requirement was unchanged. The proposed decision does include changes to the cost recovery process for liability insurance, vegetation management and wildfire mitigation capital and expense. Specifically the proposed decision would require us to file separate applications for the recovery of costs above 130% of the authorized amount. It also proposed reductions to the authorized wildfire mitigation capital costs. These are considered (\"AB\") 1054 related capital spend and are at the magnitude of roughly $900 million over two years. These amounts were already excluded from our rate based forecast so we do not anticipate a change in our rate based projection. The timing of this proposed decision should keep us on track for a final decision by the end of the year which aligns well with the previous statutory deadline of December 13th set forth by the CPUC in June. We've also sought recovery for roughly $1.3 billion of 2017 through 2019 costs through our recent wildfire mitigation and catastrophic events or WMCE filing at the CPUC. Related to these costs we received a decision in our SEMA case last week that allows us to recover roughly $450 million beginning in December. Now the wildfire mitigation catastrophic events or WMCE filings becomes the path to recover the remaining costs. On our securitization filing, hearings begin in December at the CPUC and based on the procedural schedule we anticipate the case could wrap up in the second quarter of 2021 with a securitized debt offering closely following. We will also be separately preparing our (\"AB\") 1054 related securitization filing after we receive the final decision in the 2020 generate case. Looking forward a last area I'd like to touch on due to the broad public policy focus in California is vehicle electrification. The transportation sector remains the largest emitter of greenhouse gases accounting for roughly 40% of the total for the state. So the need for emission reductions in this sector is as part of meeting our statewide carbon reduction goals is clear. Our customers' excitement for electric vehicles continues to be reflected in consistent adoption levels. More than 300,000 electric vehicles plug into PG&E's grid representing one out of every five electric vehicles nationwide and we see additional growth due to the increasingly competitive space among OEMs. Our current CPUC approved EV charging infrastructure portfolio is one of the largest of any utility in the United States. At this time, we have installed roughly 3,500 ports as part of our phase one for electric vehicle charge network filing at the CPUC and as an indicator of our customers' interest this program is more than three times oversubscribed. The Governor recently issued an executive order for zero emission passenger vehicles by 2035 and medium heavy duty vehicles by 2045 and in support of the state's clean energy goals we anticipate submitting a 10-year transportation liferification plan by early 2022.  Now I'd like to transition to our third quarter financial result. Slide 13 shows our results for the third quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the year came in at $1.6 billion and is consistent with our full year guidance. GAAP earnings including non-core items are also shown here. The non-core items are consistent with the full year 2020 guidance I mentioned. Moving on slide 14 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $590 million or $1.11 in the third quarter of last year and $461 million or $0.22 this year. The primary drivers were an increase in shares outstanding from our July 1st equity rate interest expense as well as two timing items that are each expected to reverse. The first is the 2020 generate case costs recovery and second is the timing of taxes. With the full quarter behind us after the bankruptcy, we're now very focused on executing well on the operational and financial plan we set out. We have a strong earnings projection ahead of us that are supported by regulatory outcomes that I discussed and we are excited for the long-term opportunities provided from our state's focus on clean energy technology. With that operator could you please open the lines for questions? Sure Julien. No problem. Again I think as Bill laidout, we have filed all the information that we think is relevant that the commission was seeking at this stage. We filed that on July 29th. So we do still anticipate a decision from the commission by the end of the month. What I would offer just in terms of context around it because I think there's been a little bit of confusion is maybe a couple ways to think about it. First it's important to keep in mind that while the commission's -- that decision the prior safety certificate remains in place. If we run into a scenario where the commission were not to approve you'd have a couple of things occurring. First we would have the ability to continue to have access to the AB 1054 wildfire fund but we would lose the protections of the shareholder liability cap and the improved prudency construct. So just wanted to provide that. We don't anticipate that being the outcome Julien, but I just wanted to provide that as a way for to help you think about what the other scenario could look like. Sure Julien. This is Chris. I think the safety certificate we would consider largely separate and apart. There was a fairly straightforward set of criteria that the commission was evaluating as it related to the certificate itself. If you look at the situation in terms of the data points around the Zogg fire, there were three different weather stations that were in the general vicinity which is what we shared with Judge Alsup in our filing this week and there I think what you saw is generally speaking the sustained winds were roughly 15 miles per hour in that area with gusts at certain publicly owned weather stations at up to around I think 32 miles an hour. That deviates from what we have in terms of our own planning. As you know our public safety power shutoff approach consists of a number of different considerations from relative humidity to the moisture in the fuels in the ground to wind speeds as well. The wind speeds in those areas did not meet the general requirements that we have in place. You could consider those as roughly 25 miles per hour in terms of sustained winds and generally speaking an exceedance of 45 miles per hour in terms of purposes when we typically consider shutting off an area that customers are being served by. Sure. I guess I would start with I have to acknowledge it's been a pretty dramatic year as Bill talked about in terms of statewide impacts from the August heat, storm, fires and other elements. So it's obviously Julian the market's going to continue to evolve I think from a cost recovery standpoint we do think that we have achieved what is reasonable in terms of insurance coverage before this year. In terms of next year, I think there are probably a few things at play. Our understanding as we read the statute is that AB 1054 does contemplate the wildfire safety administrator the entity that oversees the wildfire fund to contemplate a level of coverage for the industrial utilities in the state. Absent any kind of explicit guidance there we'd be looking at it next year to determine what would be the most cost effective coverage options for our customers everything from multi-year plan components, some different structures to the insurance itself as well as certainly trying to compete as best we can for the best price possible for customers. So at this stage for this year, we do have a total of a billion five in comprehensive coverage, 868 million of that is for wildfire coverage at a total cost of the one five which comes to roughly $ 860 million. No, sure Steve, I think it's a fair question the dynamics there that you should think about going forward are that the registration rights agreement that we do have with the trust provides for blackout periods some demand rights provisions and other things but largely those attributes would not be really in the public domain. Those would be exchanges of information between the company and the fire victims' trust. Certainly at this stage our interests are very aligned and so we would want to collaborate with the trust as appropriate should they undertake an unwritten offering. It's consistent Jonathan. Thanks for the question. I know that the TO20 case has some unique elements to it but at this stage the way, the thing that I would focus on is the assumption that we've called out. If you specifically look at our 2020 factors I think you'd want to focus on the AFUDC waiver because that's the piece at this stage. The other elements are fairly straightforward they're not changing relative to where we were before you. You'd want the AFUDC waiver piece to be handled by the FERC accounting staff reasonably and a general way to think about that if it's helpful Jonathan is you'd probably be looking at a $0.03 swing roughly depending on how that turns out but our assumption as we call out here implies that we think that we'll have that FERC accounting staff final view by the end of the year. It'd be looking back Jonathan. So just to be clear Jonathan, we called it out as an assumption in 2020 specifically so that's where we would anticipate the impact if it were to go in a different direction. It would be an impact confined to 2020. No. There is not specifically Jonathan. I do appreciate the question because there's been quite a bit of focus on the wildfire component of the coverage itself. We haven't provided any additional color at this stage. I certainly imagine we'll continue that discussion at the CPUC as we examine cost recovery there at this stage. Again this overlaps with the 2020 generate case proposed decision that we have and we do hope the commission ultimately in their final decision could land at the place where in the language that's reflected in our settlement agreement. Sure Michael. Good morning. I think if you look at it we call them out as well in our disclosures in the queue, but the way I think about it is you have multiple different memorandum accounts that have been stacking up. I want to say it's I could be off on this number. So I'm going to be generic, but I think it was roughly in the neighborhood to $2.5 billion to $3 billion having been building up. So I think that's where your focus is. Ultimately if you step back though these cost recovery mechanisms and the memorandum accounts are something we've been planning around for a few quarters. So I wouldn't think about it as implying there's any kind of change of the financing plan that sits behind it to support it because I think ultimately if you really start with FEMA for example, it's been a fairly straightforward cost recovery mechanism for the company for years. We were pleased to see that the interim rate relief request came through that accelerated some of those recoveries Michael, but otherwise as you see those broken out we would contemplate that traditional regulatory lag that exists for Californians that wouldn't necessarily be impacting any kind of future financing. Sure. So stepping back a bit Michael I think it's a good question. We have substantial investments needed to mitigate wildfire risk. But in terms of the company's plan it's actually pretty straightforward. We have the combination of the GTNF, our cost of capital proceeding, the generate case and now that the TO20 case which really gives us a pretty good line of sight to what that's going to look like at least for the next three years and in most of those examples. As you start to look at that kind of three to five year range we're generally speaking looking at roughly four to just north of 4% average electric system bundled average rate impacts for our customers that puts us generally speaking in line with growth projections in our state. We are very fortunate to serve the area that we do and the economic diversity that exists here and I think there's another way we look at it as you can imagine as well. We also contemplate these growth rates as it relates to a percent of share of wallet for customers. We acknowledge that our customer base is very different from customers who may live in the central valley of California to northern California and those in the more moderate temperate areas in the coastal communities and so that's the range that we're generally speaking looking at for the next few years. Sure Jeremy. So there's a few different ways to look at it. I think stepping back what I think, you're interested in and I want to be sure I'm responsible are kind of categories as a way to contemplate this. Some categories would be earnings impacting others would be more specific to benefits to customers. As we look forward to the next few years, some of those categories we've talked about include things like renewable energy credits. Anytime you look at kind of the energy side of the business in that way, we're always searching for savings to make sure that we're cost competitive on behalf of customers. So I think benefits that you would see there would accrue to customers. We also continue to evaluate additional surplus property assets largely similar treatment there in a number of those cases where if there's a developed area there. Many of those benefits would also accrue back to customers. You can imagine that conversation is really evolving in real time as we look at the COVID-19 impacts and how to think about the future state of kind of the footprint of the company. Obviously that's the case with our future move as well to Oakland and moving our primary headquarters there as well. As we think about some of these other elements of work process improvement that Bill alluded to, I think you could see a split there, but ultimately we see that as being a driver for us going forward in terms of achieving cost savings that will allow us to in the future earn our authorized return as we've guided to in 2022. Sure Ryan. I appreciate the question and I'm really not able to be much more forthcoming than that. I think it's what emphasized there and where we were really last quarter's we are really doing the internal work right now to evaluate some small non-core assets that we're evaluating. If you step back and just think about different what I'll call asset classes which are you can think about different asset classes in different ways. One of which is the land that the company owns the physical footprint that we have in different areas. Some of which is developed, some of which is not. Generally speaking the benefits of the crew from any sale will differ depending on that treatment as one example. As you look across other different asset classes there could be opportunities where the gain on sale treatment is slightly different and so at this stage we are very focused on this effort. I do think we can continue to make progress but don't want to be too specific because I don't want to get ahead of our internal work in any kind of outreach we'd otherwise be doing at a later stage."

            "name": "Bill Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I cover the priorities for the quarter, I want to express our sympathy for all of those impacted by the devastating wildfires we've experienced in California. It's been a history and very challenging wildfire season for our customers. We've seen over 4 million acres burned in California with nearly 3 million acres burned in our service area. We thank the Governor's office, CAL FIRE, California Office of Emergency Services and all the first responders for their tireless efforts in keeping out new lease safe. We continue to focus on executing a series of important changes at PG&E. These changes will help us live up to the commitments made as a part of our chapter 11 emergency plan including our efforts to improve our operations and safety outcomes, reduce risk and enhance our customer focus. This morning I'll touch on three key areas of focus for PG&E. First, improvements to our wildfire mitigation plan; second, our operational updates and third, our executive leadership recruitment progress. Chris will then cover our financial updates and key regulatory cases. Looking at our wildfire mitigation plan, our highest priorities remain mitigating ignition risk, enhancing our situational awareness and implementing public safety power shutoff or PSPS advance. We will initiate these events when absolutely necessary to protect public safety. As you can see on slide 4, we continue to be on track or ahead of our 2020 targets for system hardening, enhanced vegetation management and installation of weather stations and high definition cameras. Our efforts over the last quarter have our weather station and camera installations back on track. We will respond -- judge all such request for information in the monitor report PG&E's unit vegetation management inspections next week share the monitoring the court's goals in ensuring we operate in a safe and reliable grid. While we acknowledge there are some areas where our comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan that we stood up in 2019 could improve, we do see some of the results somewhat differently than the letter provided by the monitor. We are unable to comment any further ahead of our response which will be filed on November 3rd. There is one aspect of the wildfire mitigation program that I'll give a detailed update on and that's our Public Safety Power Shutoff or PSPS program. We have done a lot since 2019 to increase cooperation with local authorities by hiring additional talent with emergency planning expertise. We also prioritize better communications with our customers this wildfire season. The technology improvements that will help us achieve our program goals are highlighted on slide 5. As we have in prior years, we'll continually evaluate conditions that include wind speed, humidity levels and fuels moisture among other factors. When conditions warrant we will implement power shut-offs as a last resort to keep our customers and communities safe. We have taken steps to minimize the impact of these events on our customers and we've executed five events so far this year. We have made our events smarter through leveraging technology, smaller by implementing sectionalizing devices as well as temporary generation and shorter by increasing our post event inspection capabilities. We've engaged with our communities and our customers to implement changes that incorporate their feedback while we have improved in 2020 versus 2019 in making these events less disruptive we continue to learn from each event. To make our program smarter we collect fuels moisture data and incorporate it into our fire spread modeling. This data is an important indicator along with wind speeds and assessing fire conditions in real time. We utilize the fuels data along with forecasting work we do in collaboration with the national weather service to determine where we need to implement a PSPS event. Our next priority to improve the program is to make the impacted customer footprint smaller. We have pre-positioned temporary generation in regions that are prone to shut-off events. We installed 600 sectionalizing devices which were in place by the end of August. In addition, we've added an Islanding configuration at the Humboldt Bay and Caribou generating stations which allow almost 70,000 customers to stay online. Those customers would have been shut-off in 2019. This one example of how we've implemented lessons learned from previous wildfire season. These actions allowed us to meet our goal of the one-third reduction in customers impacted in our first events. In order to make outages shorter we've increased our aerial patrol abilities through additional helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. We now have access to more than 60 helicopters to help us meet our goal of a 50% faster restoration time versus 2019. I'd like to touch on a couple of other areas of PSPS implementation where we've increased our focus in 2020. This includes our coordination with county and city emergency managers and our outreach to customers. In December, we started holding town hall listening sessions with city managers, first responders and residents. At these sessions PG&E senior leaders listened to the local stakeholders and started working on plans to improve coordination for the 2020 PSPS events. Our team then held subsequent discussions where we worked through local plans for these events based on the information we learned in the listening sessions. As an example of change made resulting from these listening sessions, we increased the local presence of PG&E personnel who coordinate with emergency managers. These important employees serve as a single point of contact for individual counties and cities during a power shutoff event. On the customer side, we've also made significant changes in response to lessons learned in 2019. We conducted webinars focused on wildfire safety initiatives in the counties we serve. We ask questions and receive valuable feedback which we've used to address the concerns and needs of our customers on a county by county basis. We've worked hard on three specific areas related to customer engagement during PSPS events. The first is our notification system. The second is our website and the third is customer resources provided by PG&E. With regard to our notification system we work to notify customers with an initial watch notification message as early as 48 hours prior to event. The PSPS watch will be upgraded to a warning when forecasted conditions show that a safety shutoff will be necessary. Warning notifications are sent approximately 4 to 12 hours in advance of an event. These messages also include an expected restoration time. Outage and restoration information is updated throughout the event. We improved our messaging and direct response to customers' feedback from last year. Second, on our website improvements we have moved pge.com from our data centers to the cloud where we tested the site to levels well beyond the demand we saw during our peak usage in 2019. Our enhanced web capability allows for customers to look up shutoff times and estimated restoration times by address. This information is available as early as two days before an event occurs. Also, we increased the number of our community resource centers during PSPS events. In our first event this year we had 50 community resource centers available for analogy impacting 172,000 customers. By comparison in 2019 we had 80 centers for 1 million customers impacted. These centers provide a place for customers to go during power shutoffs and are equipped with charging stations, bottled water and other necessities. All of these locations comply with COVID safety protocols. We expect to have incremental opportunities to leverage technology to improve our wildfire mitigation plans and our PSPS implementation. We continue to incorporate feedback from our community leaders and our customers to improve these events. With respect to updates and next steps on wildfire filings, as we indicated before we anticipate a decision on our safety certification request at the CPUC by the end of this month. We believe, we provided all the necessary information and we hope to see that outcome any day now. As a reminder the prior certification we received last year remains in place. Looking forward, we will take the learnings from our wildfire mitigation plans as well as our PSPS adjustments and will reflect them in our 2021 wildfire mitigation plan filing. Last week the wildfire safety division gave all three IOUs a February deadline for that submission. One additional note on operations we were notified earlier in the month that Cal fire has taken possession of PG&E equipment as a part of their ongoing investigation into the cause of the Zogg fire which was west of Redding, California. Given the early stage of the investigation and the fact that we haven't had an opportunity to review the assets retained by CAL FIRE there is limited additional information to provide today. We are fully cooperating with CAL FIRE in its investigation and will provide more information on the Zogg fire at the appropriate time. In addition on Monday we filed a response to Judge Alsup's request for information on the Zogg fire. We will not comment any further as to we do not want to get ahead of the CAL FIRE investigation. While our electric operations are certainly an area of focus given our effort to mitigate wildfire risk I also want to highlight the continued good work done by our gas operations team. One of the major initiatives to make our gas system safer is to enable in-line inspections. This method is preferable to traditional hydrostatic testing in a couple of ways. It eliminates the need for a line to be taken out of service for testing and it's safer than hydrostatic testing which can compromise the strength of the pipe. In terms of day-to-day operations our gas odor average response times and our third-party dig-in rates are at the upper end of industry standards. These are two areas of focus to ensure we provide safe and reliable gas delivery. I want to mention two facilities that we opened in 2017 that have helped us improve our gas operations. These centers were opened in direct response to comprehensive evaluation of our operations. First, in 2017 we opened the center for gas safety which has expansive lab space that allows us to test new technologies. Second, we opened our gas safety academy. Here we offer gas operations team a training space that simulates various gas emergencies we encounter in our territory. These two centers were open to ensure that we have given our operations team the necessary technology and training facilities to drive continuous improvement. We will look to the practices we have implemented our gas business and our wild fire mitigation efforts to continue to inform our path forward while we accomplished a lot in increasing safety and reducing risk we continue to work hard to improve. The last item I'd like to cover is the progress we're making on open executive leadership roles. We remain on track to name a new CEO as well as a President Utility by the end of the year. We've also kicked off a national search for a CFO. All three of these key singular leadership searches are being supported by the same firm that will help with the alignment of abilities and backgrounds. We are fortunate to have Chris Foster taking the lead as interim CFO. Chris is leading a very strong finance department while we conduct our search for a permanent CFO. These leaders will build off a few recent hires that are very exciting. Those include Francisco Benavides our Chief Safety Officer, Sumeet Singh our Chief Risk Officer and Ajay Waghray as our Chief Information Officer. These three recent additions to the PG&E team reflect our commitment to change. We will continue to operate with a focus on safety and risk while continuously looking for new ways to implement technology to increase efficiency. To build on that a bit, I'd like to share a recent initiative that we've kicked off. We are taking a focused look at our operations. We will look to operate more efficiently and improve our relationship with our customers by creating an enterprise approach to asset management adopting consistent work management practices and implementing tools to measure track and monitor our customer experience. We'll have more to share on this initiative as we move into 2021. In closing I want to express my appreciation for all PG&E frontline employees. Our employees are navigating a difficult operating environment and they continue to execute on safety risk reduction and reliability programs across electric and gas systems. With that I'll turn it over to Chris to cover our financials and some key regulatory cases. Chris? Yes we can hear you Julien. Good morning. Hi, good morning Steve. We haven't at this point. What you'll see in our queue is that we did point out that as of October 20th the information the company has is that the trust has not sold any shares. So that really is the update on that for. I think at this stage obviously given the fire victims trust is a substantial shareholder of the company we do our best to communicate openly with them as well to help make sure that they're aware of events around the company but at this stage can't really speculate on how they're thinking about share issuances in the future. Hi Steve. This is Bill Smith. Thanks for the question. I think that generally speaking people understand the nature of the challenge that we are facing and feedback has been relatively good from our key stakeholders. No one likes to see us have to do this, but I've seen in fact some articles that kind of recognize that this is about public safety and I think as unfortunate as this season has been if you look at the early part of the season and the number of wildfires we had that had, nothing to do with utilities of any kind I think it showed the public in general that this is a much broader issue than PG&E. And I think the state of California has said something approaching 9,000 fires so far this year. So I think there's a better acceptance this year of the nature of the challenge. We've been getting some pretty good feedback from all the key stakeholders that were executing well and I would like to say that in the events that we've had this year while we're still doing some of the final tallies from this latest event. But there have been well over a hundred cases where we found debris and other things into our lines that had we not taken the proactive steps to implement a PSPS could have or would have likely started a fire. So I think that obviously you point out the Zogg issue we've got to learn more about that but I would say generally speaking what we're doing is working and I think people appreciate that it's for their safety and the safety of the communities. Yes. Well without giving any detailed specifics, I think what I would say is we're looking for people with experience and a strong commitment to safety and operational effectiveness and basically operational excellence. So I'm really pleased at how that whole process is coming along. So just stay tuned, but it's come along quite well and very much according to our plan. Thanks. This is Bill. I think there are a lot of areas. I wouldn't say there's a given major place, but there are a lot of opportunities that we think that we can do from taking approach to some of our contracting efforts. When we started after the events of 2017 and 2018, there was a very aggressive attempt to get as many resources on the ground as we could. I think there are ways for us to come back and look at that more effectively. I think one of the things I'm excited about is the point that I made about an issue that we're kicking off around some of our operational process improvements. I think there are ways that we can get much more effective at what we do, reduce lost time, take cycle time out which reduces inventory needs a lot of things. So I think it's a broad range of areas that can help us get costs out of the business not any one or two individual items. Sure. Thank you Rich. Sorry, it's limited in short because of the NOLs that the company has I think if should there be a change and should there be a substantial change in terms of tax policy I think for at least PG&E you'll see limited impacts there. Thank you. Sure Ryan. So this is really just an element of time passage and us getting better information over time. At this stage what we had referenced, we're having conversations as you can imagine with some of the different entities and in particular what we noted were the segregation claims themselves we have better data than we had before as you recall with prior, as you may recall with prior wildfires in prior years the California office of insurance had disclosed a greater level of granularity which provided one means by which to have additional input. In this situation we have now improved data as it relates to the segregation claims in particular and that allowed us to update our accrual at this stage. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Foster, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations, PG&E Corporation. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Stephanie. And thanks to those of you on the phone, for joining us. Before I turn it over to Bill Smith, I want to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, which are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations, and information currently available to Management. Also joining us this morning are John Simon, Executive Vice President Law Strategy and Policy and Jason Wells, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of the important factors that could affect the Company's actual financial results are described in the second page of today's second quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes the reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures and could be found online along with other information at investor.pgecorp.com. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that was filed with the SEC earlier today. And the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-Q. With that, I'll hand it over to Bill.\nBill Smith: Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. We are excited to return to our traditional format. Today's call marks a milestone for us and we're excited to share our post emergence vision for the coming years. We've emerged from bankruptcy as a stronger company the complex legal matters are now resolved in major regulatory cases establishing our revenues are either approved or settled. We also have a good line of sight on a regulatory framework for the next three years, our financial plan displays strong growth and enables a path for the company to get back to investment grade. Our remarks today will focus on changes we made on governance, progress on our wildfire plan and preparations ahead of the 2020 wildfire season. I will conclude with an update on key regulatory matters. Jason, will then cover the financials, including updated guidance, kind of walk through the quarterly financial results. Our focus now turns to building on the many changes we've put in place in bankruptcy. We've set the foundation for an improved Company. At the same time, we will never forget the impacts to the communities we serve and those who lost their lives as a result of catastrophic wildfires in recent years. Our mandate is to rebuild the trust of our customers while delivering operational excellence. We'll do that by focusing on responsive customer service and system investments and focus on risk reduction, safety and reliability. Organizational changes to help deliver on this mandate are already well underway. First, at the Board level a 11 new directors were ceded at the start of this month. These Directors were carefully chosen based on their individual skills and backgrounds and are well suited to [indiscernible] our Company for years to come. One of our initial priorities as a Board is to hire the next permanent CEO and that process is ongoing. We've had recent changes that we've announced among our leadership ranks and I want to thank each of them for all their contributions to PG&E. With our emergence from Chapter 11, this is a natural inflection point for leaders to evaluate their future and the roles at the Company will continue to build our team through both internal development programs and external hires. A couple of recent additions to the team include Francisco Benavides, as our Chief Safety Officer and Sumeet Singh as our Chief Risk Officer. And I'm delighted to say we'll be announcing a CIO soon. We have a seasoned team in place that is well suited to execute on our operational improvement plans developed during the bankruptcy process. For example, the core electronic operations team members that manage our wildfire mitigation efforts and successfully achieved our goals during the last wildfire season remain in place. This group has consistently improved our tools and evolved our capabilities each year. I have confidence that this team and others will add to deepen the bench will lean on their extensive experience to manage the evolving wildfire through it. And we will take the necessary steps to keep our customers safe. If you go to Slide 3, of our presentation, you can see we're progressing well on our four key wildfire mitigation plan targets; I'll cover a few areas on the wildfire preparedness front; First, I'll touch on our operational work plan status. I will also showcase some of the technology, we continue to deploy to better understand our assets and reduce risk. Then I'll touch on our public safety power shut-off or PSPS program evolution. Knowing a number of the program goals are longer term in nature, we continue to stand ready to shut off power when extreme weather conditions present themselves. So, let's start with this year's mitigation work behind these numbers, annual work plan is on track to meet all of our 2020 targets. We had some supply chain issues early on in the stages of due to COVID-19 which slowed our progress on the installation weather stations in HD cameras. We resolve those issues and fully expect to meet the program goals. Turning to Slide 4, you'll see a snapshot of how we're making foundational investments in technology that we're excited about. On our enhanced inspection work, we're evaluating new programmable flight options to ensure greater consistency and efficiency of the drone inspections we do. We've also started partnership with one of the country's most advanced data analytics companies, we're working to migrate to predictive maintenance utilizing the enormous dataset we've collected from advanced visualization inspection tools. This year will likely add another 2.5 million images of our assets. We are utilizing machine learning tools to deploy computer vision models to compile asset inspection photos. This improves the quality and consistency of the analysis. All of this part is knowing our assets better and consistently improving our records and data. Stepping back with these early stage examples we're evaluating a range of different technologies much as we did with the methane leakage technology adopted by our gas business years ago. We are fortunate to be working with California-based companies on these emerging technologies that will reduce wildfire risk in our state. We've taken this partnership approach for years on the Clean Energy front. Our announcement yesterday that we're breaking ground on just on one of the world's largest battery energy storage systems with Tesla is just another example of that. There is one other aspect of the wildfire mitigation program that I'll give an update on, and that's our PSPS program. It's covered here on Slide 5. As we have in prior years we will continually evaluate conditions that include wind speed, humidity levels, fuel moisture and other factors when conditions warrant will implement power shutoffs for public safety purposes. We've taken steps to minimize the impact of these events on our customers, we're working hard to make the PSPS programs smaller, shorter and smarter. To make our PSPS program smarter, our team will be using new whether modeling as double the granularity of the data feeding our models. Our team will now use the improved insights to inform which circuits are considered for shutoff. The improved accuracy of the forecast should ultimately result in fewer customers being impacted. Our next priority to improve the PSPS program is to make the customer footprint smaller to address this, we are pre-positioning, about 460 megawatt of temporary generation, in order to meet critical community needs in areas that have a high probability of an outage. These will be strategically placed at over 60 substations, midfielder locations and secondary health facilities. We've also installed nearly 400 sectionalizing devices and plan to achieve our 2020 goal of 600 devices by the end of August, both solutions allow us to keep power on in more places where it's safe to do so. In combination, these elements are expected to allow us to reduce the number of customers impacted by one-third. In order to make the outages experienced by our customer shorter, we've increased our Aerial Patrol abilities through additional helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, by using infrared cameras we will be able to conduct controls into the evening, unlike last year where our post of it inspections were limited daylight hours. This greatly advances, our ability to meet our goal as a 50% faster restoration time this season. As I mentioned earlier part of the improved financial foundation for the company has improved clarity on our key regulatory cases, I'll touch on a few of those. First, I'll cover some updates at the CPUC, looking back to our previous gas transmission and storage rate case we overspent on capital and Salt recovery. Roughly $600 million of that spend we're subject to audit, which was completed in May would no disallowance is recommended. We are now authorized to seek recovery of [indiscernible] that and we anticipate a decision on that filing in Q2 of 2021. As a reminder, we've reached an all-party settlement in our 2020 general rate case, the Commission recently updated the procedural schedule and we expect a final decision by the middle of December. In our securitization filing this week of scoping memo was released by the Commission, pointing to hearings at the end of November. Given this update, we would anticipate resolution around the start of 2Q next year. We are required to have our safety certificate renewed each year in order to access that AB 1054 wildfire fund. Our 2020 safety certification request is currently with the Commission for review and our certificate from last year is valid while the review is underway. Moving to FERC in our transmission owner 20 case, we are currently in settlement discussions. But we do not know the timing of potential resolution. I'll close by touching on COVID-19 and workforce impacts. And I'd be remiss not to mention other challenges, our employees and customers face given the broader backdrop of the issues that are part of our larger national discussions. While we continue to make headway in the second quarter even with the challenges created by COVID-19. The recent uptick in COVID cases in California has resulted in the state reinstituting measures to protect against further spread, compared to what we reported in May. During the period from mid-May to July, we've seen a 3% reduction in electric load and a 4% reduction in core gas load on a weather adjusted basis versus 2019. We also experienced high -- cost in 2Q. These impacts have often there have been offset by a regulatory asset that was recorded to Memorandum Account created to track COVID related costs. Given the challenge of our current operating environment, I want to take a second to express my appreciation for all PG&E frontline employees who continue to execute on our risk reduction, safety and reliability programs across Gas and Electric Systems. Our workforce is also engaged in the broader discussion around diversity and inclusion. We are fortunate to serve a customer base with extreme diversity. As a company that has weather bankruptcy and still maintains a very low overall attrition rate, we're focused on this conversation with our employees and our [Technical Difficulty] over 50% of our hires in [Technical Difficulty] and we will maintain a history of investing in diversity, including eight consecutive years of [Technical Difficulty] supplier spend. With that I'll turn it over to Jason to cover the financials.\nJason Wells: Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. I plan on covering three items, some of which are highlighted here on the financial summary on Slide 6. First, given the clarity resulting from the emergence from Chapter 11 and the resolution of key regulatory proceedings. -- Now benefit from -- as -- wildfire fund as well as from -- lastly, I'll briefly cover our results for the quarter. Stepping back to the more traditional earnings format -- Chapter 11 emergence. We plan to provide a slightly longer view of our earnings potential and a greater level of detail than in the past. We've provided some of the basic assumptions impacting GAAP and non-GAAP core earnings for you on Slide 7. We've also provided a traditional, look at CapEx and rate base growth, the latter of which is growing at roughly 8% our assumption for rate -- order due to our anticipated timeline for cost recovery of the -- rate case audit results -- million. We now have that amount included in rate base and earning a return-on-equity in 2021, there was no impact to our capital forecast for the year. One item to note is that CapEx is reflective of the $3.2 billion in wildfire mitigation spend but does not earning equity -- under AB 1054. However, this amount is not included in these rate base projections. Moving to our earnings guidance elements. First, we are updating earnings core earnings per share guidance for 2020. Second, -- non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance and updating our potential equity needs for 2021. We do about if we now go to Slide 10 starting with 2020 earnings guidance, we have updated our earnings factors to reflect the anticipated non-GAAP core earnings of roughly $2 billion for the full-year. That translates into approximately a $1.60 to $1.63 per share based on anticipated average share count of 1.25 billion shares outstanding for the full-year. This non-GAAP core earnings -- levels and reflects a tightening of -- $350 million that we provided last quarter. We are also narrowing the range on both components of under earnings on our net below the line and spend above authorized we are adjusting the expense range $225 million. And that primarily reflects additional wildfire spend up of authorized. Second, unrecoverable interest expense will be consistent with the midpoint of our prior forecast range and results in a $125 million impact to earnings for the remaining six months of the year. Keep in mind that for 2020 some of the factors such as increased shares outstanding and interest expense from our exit financing are impacting over the last six months of the year. Additionally, the guidance assumes a final decision in the 2020 GRC this year, consistent with our all-party settlement. Moving to non-core earnings guidance. There are a number of elements that I'd like to update here. First, we have an updated range for [Technical Difficulty] to a range of $2.63 billion to $2.67 billion, which reflects the total equity backs up fees of $1.5 billion, a charge of $620 million [Technical Difficulty] for the reduction of the deferred share value for the equity contributed to the Fire Victims Trust. And total legal and professional service costs for the Chapter 11 proceeding. Second, the $300 million of investigation remedies and cost recovery has been updated to reflect the uncertainty in the tax deductibility for a small portion of the amount -- due to the wildfire and Locate and Mark OII. Third amortization of the wildfire fund contribution has decreased to roughly $300 million for 2020 reflecting an increase in the assume life of the trust, that I'll discuss further in my prepared remarks. Fourth due to the media notice provided by Cal Fire recently identifying PG&E's transmission line as the cause for the Kincade fire. We've also recorded an accounting charge that reflects the low end of the range we provided last quarter. A write-off of associated restoration costs any receivable for the associated insurance recovery. And finally, we've updated the pickup associated with the successful audit of the GT&S Capital. The $80 million reflects a recognition of the regulatory asset for recovery of the historical depreciation expense and cost of debt. The final decision approving cost recovery is now anticipated in 2021 and accounting rules limit the ability for recognizing a regulatory asset for the historical equity return until that final decision is received. Moving to 2021 earnings factors on Slide 11, we have made progress addressing the factors contributing to under-earning our allowed return-on-equity, resulting in an increase in our forecasted non-GAAP core earnings relative to the forecast included in our March disclosure state. We are initiating non-GAAP core earnings for 2021 in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This is roughly $50 million to $250 million more than our previous estimate in the March disclosure statement. Comparing this range to our authorized earnings this guidance results in between $275 million and $425 million below authorized levels, reflecting an update to net below the line spend above authorized levels of up to $100 million to $325 million in unrecoverable interest expense. We have line of sight to initial improvements relative to our disclosure statement in a few areas including lower unrecoverable interest costs and renegotiated third-party contracts that will result in more efficient execution of some of our inspection repairs on our electric system next year. 2021 is the first year we'll experience the full dilution from the exit financing and as a result, this translates into a range of non-GAAP core earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05. Our 2021 guidance incorporates the same inception assumptions as 2020 with the addition of approved securitization application in the first quarter. Non-core earnings guidance for 2021 includes a one-time upfront charge for securitization of $1.36 billion, amortization of the wildfire fund contribution of $330 million bankruptcy and legal cost of around $40 million to $80 million, $80 million of investigation remedies and cost recovery and pickup, about $140 million related to the deferred equity return on the successful audit of the GT&S capital given the final decision we expect next year. We're also providing an update to our potential equity needs in 2021 which are contingent on approval next year of our securitization application at the CPUC that Bill mentioned earlier. While we remain committed to achieving an investment-grade ratings across the enterprise and paying down roughly $1.7 billion and holding company debt in 2021 consistent with our March disclosure statement, we are lowering our projected equity need in 2021 to between $450 million and $750 million. This range includes the net impact from the Kincade fire accrual this quarter. I would also like to reaffirm that we also do not have any anticipated equity needs beyond 2021 for our five-year plan. There are a few factors that contribute to this overall reduction, including the improved earnings range I referenced earlier and a slight reduction in CapEx, we are projecting. Additionally, we continue to pursue the vesting of certain non-core assets that could generate additional proceeds, more cost effectively than issuing equity it would enable us to trend of the lower end of this revised equity range. Turning to Slide 12, we have confidence that 2022 and subsequent years will continue to reflect a roughly 8% rate base growth, I mentioned earlier and that rate base growth will be outpaced by earnings growth as we continue to pay down unrecoverable interest costs. As Bill covered the operational efforts we are making to mitigate fires along with a good execution, thus far on our operational work plans or financial risk has also been reduced as we head into the traditional start of fire season. We are now fully participating in the AB 1054 wildfire fund having made our roughly $5 billion contribution. As a reminder as participants in the fund a disallowance liability cap is in place and the new prudent manager regulatory framework applies. In terms of how this contribution has been reflected in our second quarter financial statements, we've recorded a regulatory liability of $6.7 billion, reflecting the discounted value of the total payments to be made to the wildfire fund. In addition, we recorded a wildfire contribution assets of $6.5 billion with a difference reflecting amortization expense for the period of time we had partial coverage under the fund prior to our emergence from Chapter 11. The total expenses amortized based on an expected life of 15-years, which is longer than the previous estimated life of 10-years, this change resulted from an adjustment to the model to better reflect relevant historical data in the effectiveness of the state's collective wildfire mitigation programs. We also establish our new liability insurance coverage, which runs from August 2020 through July 2021, total in slightly more than $1.4 billion. The wildfire liability insurance component provides up to $757 million in coverage for the period. The non-wildfire liability insurance provides up to $700 million for wildfire events. The total cost of this overall coverage is roughly $750 million. We will continue to pursue additional insurance coverage for the same policy period and weeks to come. We will seek recovery for all premiums associated with this coverage, either through the proposed two-way balancing account included in our pending 2020 general rate case settlement or through the existing Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account tracking mechanism. Now I would like to transition to our second quarter financial results. Slide 13, shows our results for the second quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings came in at $1.3 per share and is largely consistent with the disclosure statement forecast. GAAP earnings, including non-core items are also shown here. The non-core items are consistent with the discussion of the full-year 2020 guidance I mentioned. Moving on Slide 14 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison of non-GAAP core earnings per share of $1.10 in the second quarter of last year and $1.03 this year. The primary drivers related to the way in the 2020 GRC decision as well as an increase in interest on prepetition payables and short-term debt with no corresponding cost last year and wildfire mitigation costs that exceeded our authorized levels. These costs were partially offset by growth in rate base earnings and timing of taxes. To close this out. I just want to echo Bill's comments at the start of our call today. The clarity we have on a number of fronts, positions us very well from a governance operations and financial standpoint. We are focused on earning our authorized rate of return-on-equity lastly unrecoverable interest expense in 2022. And you can see that our five-year financial plan grows at roughly 10% earnings growth, which exceeds the 8% rate base growth we provided. When combined, we see a competitive total return. Even with our temporary suspension of the dividend, having a Chapter 11 case be in on our operational plans. Open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes, thanks. Hi, good morning and nice to have you all back, doing\u2026\nBill Smith: Good Morning Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: A couple of operational questions just on the wildfire preparation. The it's not the year just based on looking full-year that you're kind of how much you're on track or not. Could you just how you're progressing with those categories and\u2026\nBill Smith: Steve, this is Bill. I'd be glad to do that. We are really on chart on target with all of the -- as I mentioned a couple that we had a little bit of a delay. Starting on were related to weather stations and the HD cameras, those were impacted by some assembly issues at factories that were closed down temporarily in some things of that nature. But, we are on plan to be on target and get -- everything completed in some of these cases we're ahead of target. So for example on the veg management, we're actually running ahead of -- where we are on temporary generation, we're going to overshoot that target by about 50%. So we're doing very well. Overall, the two items that were a little bit delayed early on. We've got a recovery plan in place. So we feel very solid about getting all of this program executed as scheduled.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then just any comment on the departure of the Utility, CEO.\nBill Smith: No, I think, I think during an emergence like this, it's a lot of times people reevaluate what's going on and so this is not an expected situation we're situated with the leadership team we have in place and we're actively bringing in the next generation of leaders for the new PG&E. So, we're all set.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. And then just on the thinking about 2021 in the securitization assumptions, -- just do things change -- dramatically for some reason the securities. And is it or would it be kind of I think you have other alternatives and worst case but just Sumeet could you give maybe a little bit of color there.\nJason Wells: Sure, happy to do so. Steve, this is Jason. While we have confidence in the securitization application being improved. I mean I think it was a strong statement of support, by governor -- when he said it was in the best interest of the public to see that securitization application approved we did as a fallback measure as part of our plan of reorganization. We asked the CPUC to approve extension of that temporary debt the $6 billion -- we asked for a -- waiver to the capital structure in the event that securitization application is not approved, so from financing risk associated with the securitization application. I would say that the one impact if not approved, would be there would be incremental unrecoverable debt on that $6 billion in 2021 and beyond.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And I apologize, I have one last question, the grantor trust discussion that you mentioned in the release that kind of in terms of the Fire Victim Trust how you treat it. Could you maybe just give a little bit of a punchline on how to interpret that. And what that discussion means?\nBill Smith: Sure. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we took a $620 million charge this quarter to reduce the deferred tax asset associated with the stock that we issued to the Fire Victims Trust. We had originally recorded -- as asset based on the settlement value of $6.75 billion. As a result of -- then that original assume asset -- billion of value attributed to that trust. At that reduction in the deferred tax asset assumes that we maintain the tax reduction based on a qualified settlement fund which essentially the tax deduction is recognized at the time, but the stock is issued to the Fire Victim Trust, however, we are pursuing a different election for the deduction -- and that would be the cross-election actually allows us to deduct the value of the stock when it is sold, and so as the stock value increases over time it would allow us to recognize a larger tax deduction. There are a couple of technical to -- convert to that grant to our trust that we are we'd expect clarity on that likely around the end of the calendar year.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate all questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hi, good morning.\nBill Smith: Good Morning, Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: Thanks for that really thorough update on a lot of topics. Just a couple of items here. I guess from my end. Just in terms of the cost of wildfire insurance you laid out the amount of coverage. I was just curious, generally in terms of commentary in terms of just availability and cost of that. What's your general sense of sort of the magnitude in cost that you're seeing these days.\nBill Smith: No, we are certainly seeing tightening in the liability insurance market well, AB 1054 provides significant financial stability to the utility's, the fact that inverse still applies mean sort of the first dollar of loss falls on liability insurers and as a result we've seen sort of tightening capacity in that market and a significant increase in costs, as I mentioned in liability insurance at $757 of which relates to wildfire claims. The total cost of that program at $750 million, it's obviously a significant increase over what we were doing several years ago and I think it sort of reflective of what will be an ongoing trend of higher liability insurance costs going forward.\nStephen Byrd: Understood. That's helpful. And then I guess, stepping back, when you look at the overall business I guess I'm thinking a lot about optimization -- and then not related to wildfire risk, but just sort of cost optimization across the entire PG&E footprint, whether that be how do you go about procurement, looking at real estate that is owned is there a potential in your mind for a kind of a more thorough review now that sort of you've re-emerged and just looking across that the whole business in terms of here's where either operating costs, not related to safety, again, but just, other areas could be reduced or real estate could be monetized just thinking more broadly, are there such opportunities?\nBill Smith: Yes, Stephen. Thanks for the question. I think there are pretty extensive of opportunities available for the company. We are cognizant of maintaining the affordability of our service particularly as we continue to invest significantly in our gas and electric systems. I think you've touched on a couple of the programs that are at the forefront of the start of our work on cost optimization and that is selling underutilized assets, things like as you mentioned real estate could also include has included selling excess renewable energy credits. I also think you've touched on another opportunity that we see an opportunity for significant improvement around and that's our third-party spend the company spent about $10 billion annually with third-party suppliers, there was a number of contracts that we had to enter into over the last couple of years to incentivize crews to come out west to accelerate the work on our wildfire system, those contracts include premiums to attract that significant level of work that was needed on our system. However, what we are doing now with third-party suppliers is we are bundling that work and committing to longer term plans in order to bring the cost structure down over-time, we've seen a couple of really good examples in our vegetation management inspection programs and look forward to continuing to work with our third-party suppliers on the rest, sort of those elements. There is an opportunity for the company to redesign, some of our work management related capabilities, but our focus is on the upcoming fire season and so, we will grow into that sort of process redesign over the coming couple of years.\nOperator: You're next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, everyone.\nBill Smith: Good morning Jonathan.\nJonathan Arnold: And can I just ask on the timing of the CEO search process you I think you mentioned you were going to announce a new CIO soon, but any sense of just what the sort of likely time frame for the leadership announcement would be and then also on that topic do you anticipate still having a separate Utility and Co-CEO. It is, could be as a reminder on where you stand on that Governance question?\nBill Smith: Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Bill. The search is being launch for the CEO as we speak, so that process is underway. The target deadline is to have someone in that role permanent -- by the end of the year fortunately, there is no -- flexibility to be in the role as long as I need to be, but we're really looking for getting the next generation of the leadership team fully in place and get that flows. So, that team can start executing their plan going forward. So we think that it's reasonable to have that individual in place by the end of the year and that's still our target. But what's most important is finding the right person. So, there's nothing artificially imposing a deadline on that particular item. With regard to the Utility head. There is a requirement to have some separation between the corporation and the Utility. I don't think it will be a CEO per se, I think will likely go back to the way it had been for a number of years with the President of the Utility more if you think about it more of a President and Chief Operating Officer. That seems to make more sense, I think it's been a little bit confusing to a lot of constituents with the dual CEO title, but there are some requirements to keep separation between the Utility in the Corporation and we'll obviously continue to honor those.\nJonathan Arnold: Great, thank you, Bill. And then Matt just on one other question on the equity for the 2021 if I believe in the disclosure statement you sort of talked about that being one possibility, but you might also pay down debt a little slower, presumably, if you didn't like the price on the potential equity issuances that should we take what you're doing today more as a definitive statement that you plan to do this piece with equity or is it still possible you might choose not to.\nJason Wells: Jonathan, thanks for the question. I mean, I do think we retain that flexibility as we look at, there is equity needs. Right. Let me clarify a couple of things first he equity that I mentioned that revised range to $450 million to $750 million that's contingent on the securitization application. We also have had an opportunity given sort of the earnings forecast improvements as well as some timing and cash flows have been able to sort of generate a reduction in that contingent equity need. As I also mentioned, we are exploring certain divestiture of non-core assets with sort of a more natural owner and so that would also has an opportunity sort of bring us to the lower end of the range that I mentioned and then into the point that you raised. We do have some flexibility around the timing of the holding company debt pay down, but I want to reiterate we are also committed to improving our balance sheet health and achieving investment grade credit ratings. And so I would anticipate, if the securitization application is issued equity in that general range next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from [indiscernible] with Citi. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning.\nJason Wells: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: In terms of the $757 million insurance. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned potential to expand that further new operator around the potential or what you'd call would be as we get closer to wildfires here?\nBill Smith: Yes, we're currently as conducting this call is still in the market with a number of different risk transfer policies, and so we think that there is still some -- that we are continuing to pursue our goal would be to try to achieve the billion [ph] for that it's prescribed under AB 1054 I will say, I think [Technical Difficulty] full level, but there is some additional capacity -- in the market that we're pursuing.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then in terms of the issuance assumption for '21 beyond asset sales, are there any other key drivers of where you may be within the range as the securitization?\nBill Smith: No, the reduction in the equity range really improved earnings forecast some of the cash flow benefits that I mentioned really bring us to sort of I call it -- it's the disposition of some non-core assets that would drive us to the lower end of that range that we provided.\nOperator: Next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey guys, Thank you for taking my question. All of the upper you've put in over the last two years, especially over the life 18 or 20 months, which has been hectic obviously just curious, can you, Jason talk about the holding company debt. So I think it was around $4.8 billion. And then the temporary short-term debt the $6 billion. Can you walk us through a path -- over the next couple of years of what you want those balances to be two or three years from now and how you get there.\nJohn Simon: Thanks, Michael. Great to be back on a formal earnings call again. With respect to the holding company debt as part of our plan of reorganization we committed to the State of California that we would not reinstate our common stock dividend until we had achieved $6.2 billion of non-GAAP core earnings, that's roughly about three years post emergence. And so those retained cash flows provide significant capacity to pay down that holding company debt. We are anticipating paying down roughly a little more than $3 billion of that debt over the next five years with the majority of that debt being paid down over the retained cash flows from that suspended dividend. I think with respect to the $6 billion in temporary debt there is really two paths to pay that debt down the first path is the securitization application that is in front of the commission to the extent that application is approved the $7.5 billion of proceeds from that securitization will be used to pay down a $6 billion in temporary debt if, and we think it's unlikely the securitization application is not approved. We have asked the Commission for a permanent capital structure waiver on that $6 billion temporary debt and what we have committed to is using the shareholder funded net operating losses as we realize those shareholder net operating losses, we will use those cash flows to pay down that $6 billion in temporary debt over time. And so those would be the two pathways to addressing that debt at the utility level.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And if I think about when you guide for 2021 guidance the unrecoverable interest expense that you lay out in the guidance slide how much is that all just tied to the HoldCo debt into the temporary debt or is there anything else that's contributing to that?\nJason Wells: There are sort of the three sort of factors that I would, there is some incremental debt above authorized levels; First, we raised about $2.5 billion of incremental debt at the utility to fund half of the wildfire fund contribution upon emergence that has no impact on our equity ratio because we have an equal amount of equity to offset it on a ratio standpoint, but it is $2.5 billion of debt above authorized levels that contributes to under recovery. And then, as a result of the securitization application and the impact on the equity ratio we do have a modest amount of incremental Utility debt in 2021 that is contributing to that unrecoverable interest expense that will effectively get paid down in 2022 and 2023. Those are sort of the three sources beyond again the holding company and the temporary debt we discussed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Richard Sutherland with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Sutherland: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe turning back to the insurance premium question by that we've touched on a couple of times. Could you speak to the AB 1054 requirements and any changes there possible should you be under situation, we are not going for recovery of the premiums.\nJason Wells: Thanks, Richard for the question. No, I wouldn't anticipate any change to that fundamental structure that in AB 1054 -- in AB 1054 as past really sets sort of the foundation for eligibility for the state wildfire fund that damages that exceed $1 billion utilities are encouraged to secure risk transfer up to that level given kind of all of the issues that California is currently undertaking. I don't necessarily see an amendment AB 1054 that would modify that, that expected level of risk transfer liability insurance.\nRichard Sutherland: Got it. Thank you. And then just on Kincade real quickly, you spoke a little bit about this in the script, but curious in terms of reaching the expected impact of the costs in 2020 here what hurdles from, I guess the CPUC or other parties -- standpoint remain to kind of tying it up?\nJohn Simon: Hi, Richard, it's John. I will say on Kincade. It's very early in the process and I won't speculate on tying it up what makes it really difficult to give more certainty in the answer is, a couple of things; First, we don't have the evidence fire has that their concluding there and after the fire. So they have things as you probably know, we don't have the report which lays out their determination, we'd certainly like to see it. What I can tell you is meant is the cause of Kincade. We would work for an expeditious for the timing and so with a -- question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nPaul Fremont: Thank you very much and congratulations for being back I guess my first question. Can you just confirm the dollar amounts doing the pipe and the convert, including all the over allotment that are sort haven't been finalized.\nBill Smith: Yes. Thanks, Paul. For the question. The over allotment feature the backstop of the green shoe -- the structures were put in place to ensure that we raised a total of $9 billion across the pipe, the mandatory convertible equity as well as the common equity and so we have issued the total $9 billion as a result of the expiration of that over allotment feature at this time.\nPaul Fremont: Great. And can I just get the convert dollar amount that because that's obviously going to affect the future share count.\nChris Foster: Paul, it's Chris. I'll make sure we follow up with you separately on that.\nPaul Fremont: Great. Then is a secure, would you expect the securitization to -- have you receive regulatory approvals\u2026\nChris Foster: Generally speaking, there is a 90 day -- applications. I don't think that -- I think in terms of Bill's prepared remarks references in the second quarter, we took into consideration, the timing of the decision is well, as the appeal window. So we think it is sometime sort of early in the second quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Good morning. And definitely appreciate you guys during the call and taking the questions. Quick question, you answered most of them, but for the CEO search how much input -- is the --are you going to seek or do you have to seek from legislators, governor's office and other non- Utility entities?\nBill Smith: This is Bill. Thanks for the question. There is no formal requirement obviously, we will look for someone -- that would be a good fit in California and someone that the stakeholders here would be comfortable with. There is no formal requirement for approval, but that process basically is what we went through in feeding the new Board. And the new Board is extremely talented group of people and I think we'll do the same thing with the CEO search. So I'm really, really pleased at the prospects of having high caliber challenge for obviously the last couple of years, but there is nothing that will keep this Corporation in my opinion from being able to perform in top quartile, if not top decile level, we just got some work to do and I think it's a great opportunity for the right person coming in. So, I have no concerns about any inability to find someone that's a nice fit for the environment here in California.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great, thanks. And then one other quick follow-up on Kincade, what is the time line or the ability or the amount that you'd have access to the AB 1054 fund and how that might impact the insurance recovery that you've booked so far.\nBill Smith: Thanks, Travis. I'll answer the first part, maybe, Jason you can answer the second part in terms of the wildfire fund AB 1054 is available for claims costs after insurance above $1 billion for the reasons I was mentioning earlier it's very early for us, no evidence no report we haven't paid any claims side there. So in terms of tapping into that fund won't speculate on that and maybe, Jason on the second part.\nJason Wells: Yes. Thanks, John. Right now because the accrual estimate is below the $1 billion threshold. There's been no recognition of cost recovery from the states wildfire fund it we would only begin to record a receivable for our the cost exceeded $1 billion, up $4 billion threshold one thing though that I will point out is that we do have and are -- eligible about 10% of those costs through our transmission and rate cases, we have to wait and see what the underlying report by fire -- before we can see that cost recovery, but in the event that -- there our substantive violations identified, then we have the opportunity to again speak about 10% of the net cost through the Transmission Owner rate case process.\nBill Smith: Thank you. Travis for that question, Stephanie, thanks for helping us to organize the call today. Everyone, thanks for joining for our call today. Have a safe day and fell free to ask us if you have additional questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jason Wells",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. I plan on covering three items, some of which are highlighted here on the financial summary on Slide 6. First, given the clarity resulting from the emergence from Chapter 11 and the resolution of key regulatory proceedings. -- Now benefit from -- as -- wildfire fund as well as from -- lastly, I'll briefly cover our results for the quarter. Stepping back to the more traditional earnings format -- Chapter 11 emergence. We plan to provide a slightly longer view of our earnings potential and a greater level of detail than in the past. We've provided some of the basic assumptions impacting GAAP and non-GAAP core earnings for you on Slide 7. We've also provided a traditional, look at CapEx and rate base growth, the latter of which is growing at roughly 8% our assumption for rate -- order due to our anticipated timeline for cost recovery of the -- rate case audit results -- million. We now have that amount included in rate base and earning a return-on-equity in 2021, there was no impact to our capital forecast for the year. One item to note is that CapEx is reflective of the $3.2 billion in wildfire mitigation spend but does not earning equity -- under AB 1054. However, this amount is not included in these rate base projections. Moving to our earnings guidance elements. First, we are updating earnings core earnings per share guidance for 2020. Second, -- non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance and updating our potential equity needs for 2021. We do about if we now go to Slide 10 starting with 2020 earnings guidance, we have updated our earnings factors to reflect the anticipated non-GAAP core earnings of roughly $2 billion for the full-year. That translates into approximately a $1.60 to $1.63 per share based on anticipated average share count of 1.25 billion shares outstanding for the full-year. This non-GAAP core earnings -- levels and reflects a tightening of -- $350 million that we provided last quarter. We are also narrowing the range on both components of under earnings on our net below the line and spend above authorized we are adjusting the expense range $225 million. And that primarily reflects additional wildfire spend up of authorized. Second, unrecoverable interest expense will be consistent with the midpoint of our prior forecast range and results in a $125 million impact to earnings for the remaining six months of the year. Keep in mind that for 2020 some of the factors such as increased shares outstanding and interest expense from our exit financing are impacting over the last six months of the year. Additionally, the guidance assumes a final decision in the 2020 GRC this year, consistent with our all-party settlement. Moving to non-core earnings guidance. There are a number of elements that I'd like to update here. First, we have an updated range for [Technical Difficulty] to a range of $2.63 billion to $2.67 billion, which reflects the total equity backs up fees of $1.5 billion, a charge of $620 million [Technical Difficulty] for the reduction of the deferred share value for the equity contributed to the Fire Victims Trust. And total legal and professional service costs for the Chapter 11 proceeding. Second, the $300 million of investigation remedies and cost recovery has been updated to reflect the uncertainty in the tax deductibility for a small portion of the amount -- due to the wildfire and Locate and Mark OII. Third amortization of the wildfire fund contribution has decreased to roughly $300 million for 2020 reflecting an increase in the assume life of the trust, that I'll discuss further in my prepared remarks. Fourth due to the media notice provided by Cal Fire recently identifying PG&E's transmission line as the cause for the Kincade fire. We've also recorded an accounting charge that reflects the low end of the range we provided last quarter. A write-off of associated restoration costs any receivable for the associated insurance recovery. And finally, we've updated the pickup associated with the successful audit of the GT&S Capital. The $80 million reflects a recognition of the regulatory asset for recovery of the historical depreciation expense and cost of debt. The final decision approving cost recovery is now anticipated in 2021 and accounting rules limit the ability for recognizing a regulatory asset for the historical equity return until that final decision is received. Moving to 2021 earnings factors on Slide 11, we have made progress addressing the factors contributing to under-earning our allowed return-on-equity, resulting in an increase in our forecasted non-GAAP core earnings relative to the forecast included in our March disclosure state. We are initiating non-GAAP core earnings for 2021 in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This is roughly $50 million to $250 million more than our previous estimate in the March disclosure statement. Comparing this range to our authorized earnings this guidance results in between $275 million and $425 million below authorized levels, reflecting an update to net below the line spend above authorized levels of up to $100 million to $325 million in unrecoverable interest expense. We have line of sight to initial improvements relative to our disclosure statement in a few areas including lower unrecoverable interest costs and renegotiated third-party contracts that will result in more efficient execution of some of our inspection repairs on our electric system next year. 2021 is the first year we'll experience the full dilution from the exit financing and as a result, this translates into a range of non-GAAP core earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05. Our 2021 guidance incorporates the same inception assumptions as 2020 with the addition of approved securitization application in the first quarter. Non-core earnings guidance for 2021 includes a one-time upfront charge for securitization of $1.36 billion, amortization of the wildfire fund contribution of $330 million bankruptcy and legal cost of around $40 million to $80 million, $80 million of investigation remedies and cost recovery and pickup, about $140 million related to the deferred equity return on the successful audit of the GT&S capital given the final decision we expect next year. We're also providing an update to our potential equity needs in 2021 which are contingent on approval next year of our securitization application at the CPUC that Bill mentioned earlier. While we remain committed to achieving an investment-grade ratings across the enterprise and paying down roughly $1.7 billion and holding company debt in 2021 consistent with our March disclosure statement, we are lowering our projected equity need in 2021 to between $450 million and $750 million. This range includes the net impact from the Kincade fire accrual this quarter. I would also like to reaffirm that we also do not have any anticipated equity needs beyond 2021 for our five-year plan. There are a few factors that contribute to this overall reduction, including the improved earnings range I referenced earlier and a slight reduction in CapEx, we are projecting. Additionally, we continue to pursue the vesting of certain non-core assets that could generate additional proceeds, more cost effectively than issuing equity it would enable us to trend of the lower end of this revised equity range. Turning to Slide 12, we have confidence that 2022 and subsequent years will continue to reflect a roughly 8% rate base growth, I mentioned earlier and that rate base growth will be outpaced by earnings growth as we continue to pay down unrecoverable interest costs. As Bill covered the operational efforts we are making to mitigate fires along with a good execution, thus far on our operational work plans or financial risk has also been reduced as we head into the traditional start of fire season. We are now fully participating in the AB 1054 wildfire fund having made our roughly $5 billion contribution. As a reminder as participants in the fund a disallowance liability cap is in place and the new prudent manager regulatory framework applies. In terms of how this contribution has been reflected in our second quarter financial statements, we've recorded a regulatory liability of $6.7 billion, reflecting the discounted value of the total payments to be made to the wildfire fund. In addition, we recorded a wildfire contribution assets of $6.5 billion with a difference reflecting amortization expense for the period of time we had partial coverage under the fund prior to our emergence from Chapter 11. The total expenses amortized based on an expected life of 15-years, which is longer than the previous estimated life of 10-years, this change resulted from an adjustment to the model to better reflect relevant historical data in the effectiveness of the state's collective wildfire mitigation programs. We also establish our new liability insurance coverage, which runs from August 2020 through July 2021, total in slightly more than $1.4 billion. The wildfire liability insurance component provides up to $757 million in coverage for the period. The non-wildfire liability insurance provides up to $700 million for wildfire events. The total cost of this overall coverage is roughly $750 million. We will continue to pursue additional insurance coverage for the same policy period and weeks to come. We will seek recovery for all premiums associated with this coverage, either through the proposed two-way balancing account included in our pending 2020 general rate case settlement or through the existing Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account tracking mechanism. Now I would like to transition to our second quarter financial results. Slide 13, shows our results for the second quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings came in at $1.3 per share and is largely consistent with the disclosure statement forecast. GAAP earnings, including non-core items are also shown here. The non-core items are consistent with the discussion of the full-year 2020 guidance I mentioned. Moving on Slide 14 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison of non-GAAP core earnings per share of $1.10 in the second quarter of last year and $1.03 this year. The primary drivers related to the way in the 2020 GRC decision as well as an increase in interest on prepetition payables and short-term debt with no corresponding cost last year and wildfire mitigation costs that exceeded our authorized levels. These costs were partially offset by growth in rate base earnings and timing of taxes. To close this out. I just want to echo Bill's comments at the start of our call today. The clarity we have on a number of fronts, positions us very well from a governance operations and financial standpoint. We are focused on earning our authorized rate of return-on-equity lastly unrecoverable interest expense in 2022. And you can see that our five-year financial plan grows at roughly 10% earnings growth, which exceeds the 8% rate base growth we provided. When combined, we see a competitive total return. Even with our temporary suspension of the dividend, having a Chapter 11 case be in on our operational plans. Open up the line for questions. Sure, happy to do so. Steve, this is Jason. While we have confidence in the securitization application being improved. I mean I think it was a strong statement of support, by governor -- when he said it was in the best interest of the public to see that securitization application approved we did as a fallback measure as part of our plan of reorganization. We asked the CPUC to approve extension of that temporary debt the $6 billion -- we asked for a -- waiver to the capital structure in the event that securitization application is not approved, so from financing risk associated with the securitization application. I would say that the one impact if not approved, would be there would be incremental unrecoverable debt on that $6 billion in 2021 and beyond. Jonathan, thanks for the question. I mean, I do think we retain that flexibility as we look at, there is equity needs. Right. Let me clarify a couple of things first he equity that I mentioned that revised range to $450 million to $750 million that's contingent on the securitization application. We also have had an opportunity given sort of the earnings forecast improvements as well as some timing and cash flows have been able to sort of generate a reduction in that contingent equity need. As I also mentioned, we are exploring certain divestiture of non-core assets with sort of a more natural owner and so that would also has an opportunity sort of bring us to the lower end of the range that I mentioned and then into the point that you raised. We do have some flexibility around the timing of the holding company debt pay down, but I want to reiterate we are also committed to improving our balance sheet health and achieving investment grade credit ratings. And so I would anticipate, if the securitization application is issued equity in that general range next year. Good morning. There are sort of the three sort of factors that I would, there is some incremental debt above authorized levels; First, we raised about $2.5 billion of incremental debt at the utility to fund half of the wildfire fund contribution upon emergence that has no impact on our equity ratio because we have an equal amount of equity to offset it on a ratio standpoint, but it is $2.5 billion of debt above authorized levels that contributes to under recovery. And then, as a result of the securitization application and the impact on the equity ratio we do have a modest amount of incremental Utility debt in 2021 that is contributing to that unrecoverable interest expense that will effectively get paid down in 2022 and 2023. Those are sort of the three sources beyond again the holding company and the temporary debt we discussed. Thanks, Richard for the question. No, I wouldn't anticipate any change to that fundamental structure that in AB 1054 -- in AB 1054 as past really sets sort of the foundation for eligibility for the state wildfire fund that damages that exceed $1 billion utilities are encouraged to secure risk transfer up to that level given kind of all of the issues that California is currently undertaking. I don't necessarily see an amendment AB 1054 that would modify that, that expected level of risk transfer liability insurance. Yes. Thanks, John. Right now because the accrual estimate is below the $1 billion threshold. There's been no recognition of cost recovery from the states wildfire fund it we would only begin to record a receivable for our the cost exceeded $1 billion, up $4 billion threshold one thing though that I will point out is that we do have and are -- eligible about 10% of those costs through our transmission and rate cases, we have to wait and see what the underlying report by fire -- before we can see that cost recovery, but in the event that -- there our substantive violations identified, then we have the opportunity to again speak about 10% of the net cost through the Transmission Owner rate case process."

            "name": "Bill Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. We are excited to return to our traditional format. Today's call marks a milestone for us and we're excited to share our post emergence vision for the coming years. We've emerged from bankruptcy as a stronger company the complex legal matters are now resolved in major regulatory cases establishing our revenues are either approved or settled. We also have a good line of sight on a regulatory framework for the next three years, our financial plan displays strong growth and enables a path for the company to get back to investment grade. Our remarks today will focus on changes we made on governance, progress on our wildfire plan and preparations ahead of the 2020 wildfire season. I will conclude with an update on key regulatory matters. Jason, will then cover the financials, including updated guidance, kind of walk through the quarterly financial results. Our focus now turns to building on the many changes we've put in place in bankruptcy. We've set the foundation for an improved Company. At the same time, we will never forget the impacts to the communities we serve and those who lost their lives as a result of catastrophic wildfires in recent years. Our mandate is to rebuild the trust of our customers while delivering operational excellence. We'll do that by focusing on responsive customer service and system investments and focus on risk reduction, safety and reliability. Organizational changes to help deliver on this mandate are already well underway. First, at the Board level a 11 new directors were ceded at the start of this month. These Directors were carefully chosen based on their individual skills and backgrounds and are well suited to [indiscernible] our Company for years to come. One of our initial priorities as a Board is to hire the next permanent CEO and that process is ongoing. We've had recent changes that we've announced among our leadership ranks and I want to thank each of them for all their contributions to PG&E. With our emergence from Chapter 11, this is a natural inflection point for leaders to evaluate their future and the roles at the Company will continue to build our team through both internal development programs and external hires. A couple of recent additions to the team include Francisco Benavides, as our Chief Safety Officer and Sumeet Singh as our Chief Risk Officer. And I'm delighted to say we'll be announcing a CIO soon. We have a seasoned team in place that is well suited to execute on our operational improvement plans developed during the bankruptcy process. For example, the core electronic operations team members that manage our wildfire mitigation efforts and successfully achieved our goals during the last wildfire season remain in place. This group has consistently improved our tools and evolved our capabilities each year. I have confidence that this team and others will add to deepen the bench will lean on their extensive experience to manage the evolving wildfire through it. And we will take the necessary steps to keep our customers safe. If you go to Slide 3, of our presentation, you can see we're progressing well on our four key wildfire mitigation plan targets; I'll cover a few areas on the wildfire preparedness front; First, I'll touch on our operational work plan status. I will also showcase some of the technology, we continue to deploy to better understand our assets and reduce risk. Then I'll touch on our public safety power shut-off or PSPS program evolution. Knowing a number of the program goals are longer term in nature, we continue to stand ready to shut off power when extreme weather conditions present themselves. So, let's start with this year's mitigation work behind these numbers, annual work plan is on track to meet all of our 2020 targets. We had some supply chain issues early on in the stages of due to COVID-19 which slowed our progress on the installation weather stations in HD cameras. We resolve those issues and fully expect to meet the program goals. Turning to Slide 4, you'll see a snapshot of how we're making foundational investments in technology that we're excited about. On our enhanced inspection work, we're evaluating new programmable flight options to ensure greater consistency and efficiency of the drone inspections we do. We've also started partnership with one of the country's most advanced data analytics companies, we're working to migrate to predictive maintenance utilizing the enormous dataset we've collected from advanced visualization inspection tools. This year will likely add another 2.5 million images of our assets. We are utilizing machine learning tools to deploy computer vision models to compile asset inspection photos. This improves the quality and consistency of the analysis. All of this part is knowing our assets better and consistently improving our records and data. Stepping back with these early stage examples we're evaluating a range of different technologies much as we did with the methane leakage technology adopted by our gas business years ago. We are fortunate to be working with California-based companies on these emerging technologies that will reduce wildfire risk in our state. We've taken this partnership approach for years on the Clean Energy front. Our announcement yesterday that we're breaking ground on just on one of the world's largest battery energy storage systems with Tesla is just another example of that. There is one other aspect of the wildfire mitigation program that I'll give an update on, and that's our PSPS program. It's covered here on Slide 5. As we have in prior years we will continually evaluate conditions that include wind speed, humidity levels, fuel moisture and other factors when conditions warrant will implement power shutoffs for public safety purposes. We've taken steps to minimize the impact of these events on our customers, we're working hard to make the PSPS programs smaller, shorter and smarter. To make our PSPS program smarter, our team will be using new whether modeling as double the granularity of the data feeding our models. Our team will now use the improved insights to inform which circuits are considered for shutoff. The improved accuracy of the forecast should ultimately result in fewer customers being impacted. Our next priority to improve the PSPS program is to make the customer footprint smaller to address this, we are pre-positioning, about 460 megawatt of temporary generation, in order to meet critical community needs in areas that have a high probability of an outage. These will be strategically placed at over 60 substations, midfielder locations and secondary health facilities. We've also installed nearly 400 sectionalizing devices and plan to achieve our 2020 goal of 600 devices by the end of August, both solutions allow us to keep power on in more places where it's safe to do so. In combination, these elements are expected to allow us to reduce the number of customers impacted by one-third. In order to make the outages experienced by our customer shorter, we've increased our Aerial Patrol abilities through additional helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, by using infrared cameras we will be able to conduct controls into the evening, unlike last year where our post of it inspections were limited daylight hours. This greatly advances, our ability to meet our goal as a 50% faster restoration time this season. As I mentioned earlier part of the improved financial foundation for the company has improved clarity on our key regulatory cases, I'll touch on a few of those. First, I'll cover some updates at the CPUC, looking back to our previous gas transmission and storage rate case we overspent on capital and Salt recovery. Roughly $600 million of that spend we're subject to audit, which was completed in May would no disallowance is recommended. We are now authorized to seek recovery of [indiscernible] that and we anticipate a decision on that filing in Q2 of 2021. As a reminder, we've reached an all-party settlement in our 2020 general rate case, the Commission recently updated the procedural schedule and we expect a final decision by the middle of December. In our securitization filing this week of scoping memo was released by the Commission, pointing to hearings at the end of November. Given this update, we would anticipate resolution around the start of 2Q next year. We are required to have our safety certificate renewed each year in order to access that AB 1054 wildfire fund. Our 2020 safety certification request is currently with the Commission for review and our certificate from last year is valid while the review is underway. Moving to FERC in our transmission owner 20 case, we are currently in settlement discussions. But we do not know the timing of potential resolution. I'll close by touching on COVID-19 and workforce impacts. And I'd be remiss not to mention other challenges, our employees and customers face given the broader backdrop of the issues that are part of our larger national discussions. While we continue to make headway in the second quarter even with the challenges created by COVID-19. The recent uptick in COVID cases in California has resulted in the state reinstituting measures to protect against further spread, compared to what we reported in May. During the period from mid-May to July, we've seen a 3% reduction in electric load and a 4% reduction in core gas load on a weather adjusted basis versus 2019. We also experienced high -- cost in 2Q. These impacts have often there have been offset by a regulatory asset that was recorded to Memorandum Account created to track COVID related costs. Given the challenge of our current operating environment, I want to take a second to express my appreciation for all PG&E frontline employees who continue to execute on our risk reduction, safety and reliability programs across Gas and Electric Systems. Our workforce is also engaged in the broader discussion around diversity and inclusion. We are fortunate to serve a customer base with extreme diversity. As a company that has weather bankruptcy and still maintains a very low overall attrition rate, we're focused on this conversation with our employees and our [Technical Difficulty] over 50% of our hires in [Technical Difficulty] and we will maintain a history of investing in diversity, including eight consecutive years of [Technical Difficulty] supplier spend. With that I'll turn it over to Jason to cover the financials. Good Morning Steve. Steve, this is Bill. I'd be glad to do that. We are really on chart on target with all of the -- as I mentioned a couple that we had a little bit of a delay. Starting on were related to weather stations and the HD cameras, those were impacted by some assembly issues at factories that were closed down temporarily in some things of that nature. But, we are on plan to be on target and get -- everything completed in some of these cases we're ahead of target. So for example on the veg management, we're actually running ahead of -- where we are on temporary generation, we're going to overshoot that target by about 50%. So we're doing very well. Overall, the two items that were a little bit delayed early on. We've got a recovery plan in place. So we feel very solid about getting all of this program executed as scheduled. No, I think, I think during an emergence like this, it's a lot of times people reevaluate what's going on and so this is not an expected situation we're situated with the leadership team we have in place and we're actively bringing in the next generation of leaders for the new PG&E. So, we're all set. Sure. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we took a $620 million charge this quarter to reduce the deferred tax asset associated with the stock that we issued to the Fire Victims Trust. We had originally recorded -- as asset based on the settlement value of $6.75 billion. As a result of -- then that original assume asset -- billion of value attributed to that trust. At that reduction in the deferred tax asset assumes that we maintain the tax reduction based on a qualified settlement fund which essentially the tax deduction is recognized at the time, but the stock is issued to the Fire Victim Trust, however, we are pursuing a different election for the deduction -- and that would be the cross-election actually allows us to deduct the value of the stock when it is sold, and so as the stock value increases over time it would allow us to recognize a larger tax deduction. There are a couple of technical to -- convert to that grant to our trust that we are we'd expect clarity on that likely around the end of the calendar year. Good Morning, Stephen. No, we are certainly seeing tightening in the liability insurance market well, AB 1054 provides significant financial stability to the utility's, the fact that inverse still applies mean sort of the first dollar of loss falls on liability insurers and as a result we've seen sort of tightening capacity in that market and a significant increase in costs, as I mentioned in liability insurance at $757 of which relates to wildfire claims. The total cost of that program at $750 million, it's obviously a significant increase over what we were doing several years ago and I think it sort of reflective of what will be an ongoing trend of higher liability insurance costs going forward. Yes, Stephen. Thanks for the question. I think there are pretty extensive of opportunities available for the company. We are cognizant of maintaining the affordability of our service particularly as we continue to invest significantly in our gas and electric systems. I think you've touched on a couple of the programs that are at the forefront of the start of our work on cost optimization and that is selling underutilized assets, things like as you mentioned real estate could also include has included selling excess renewable energy credits. I also think you've touched on another opportunity that we see an opportunity for significant improvement around and that's our third-party spend the company spent about $10 billion annually with third-party suppliers, there was a number of contracts that we had to enter into over the last couple of years to incentivize crews to come out west to accelerate the work on our wildfire system, those contracts include premiums to attract that significant level of work that was needed on our system. However, what we are doing now with third-party suppliers is we are bundling that work and committing to longer term plans in order to bring the cost structure down over-time, we've seen a couple of really good examples in our vegetation management inspection programs and look forward to continuing to work with our third-party suppliers on the rest, sort of those elements. There is an opportunity for the company to redesign, some of our work management related capabilities, but our focus is on the upcoming fire season and so, we will grow into that sort of process redesign over the coming couple of years. Good morning Jonathan. Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Bill. The search is being launch for the CEO as we speak, so that process is underway. The target deadline is to have someone in that role permanent -- by the end of the year fortunately, there is no -- flexibility to be in the role as long as I need to be, but we're really looking for getting the next generation of the leadership team fully in place and get that flows. So, that team can start executing their plan going forward. So we think that it's reasonable to have that individual in place by the end of the year and that's still our target. But what's most important is finding the right person. So, there's nothing artificially imposing a deadline on that particular item. With regard to the Utility head. There is a requirement to have some separation between the corporation and the Utility. I don't think it will be a CEO per se, I think will likely go back to the way it had been for a number of years with the President of the Utility more if you think about it more of a President and Chief Operating Officer. That seems to make more sense, I think it's been a little bit confusing to a lot of constituents with the dual CEO title, but there are some requirements to keep separation between the Utility in the Corporation and we'll obviously continue to honor those. Yes, we're currently as conducting this call is still in the market with a number of different risk transfer policies, and so we think that there is still some -- that we are continuing to pursue our goal would be to try to achieve the billion [ph] for that it's prescribed under AB 1054 I will say, I think [Technical Difficulty] full level, but there is some additional capacity -- in the market that we're pursuing. No, the reduction in the equity range really improved earnings forecast some of the cash flow benefits that I mentioned really bring us to sort of I call it -- it's the disposition of some non-core assets that would drive us to the lower end of that range that we provided. Yes. Thanks, Paul. For the question. The over allotment feature the backstop of the green shoe -- the structures were put in place to ensure that we raised a total of $9 billion across the pipe, the mandatory convertible equity as well as the common equity and so we have issued the total $9 billion as a result of the expiration of that over allotment feature at this time. This is Bill. Thanks for the question. There is no formal requirement obviously, we will look for someone -- that would be a good fit in California and someone that the stakeholders here would be comfortable with. There is no formal requirement for approval, but that process basically is what we went through in feeding the new Board. And the new Board is extremely talented group of people and I think we'll do the same thing with the CEO search. So I'm really, really pleased at the prospects of having high caliber challenge for obviously the last couple of years, but there is nothing that will keep this Corporation in my opinion from being able to perform in top quartile, if not top decile level, we just got some work to do and I think it's a great opportunity for the right person coming in. So, I have no concerns about any inability to find someone that's a nice fit for the environment here in California. Thanks, Travis. I'll answer the first part, maybe, Jason you can answer the second part in terms of the wildfire fund AB 1054 is available for claims costs after insurance above $1 billion for the reasons I was mentioning earlier it's very early for us, no evidence no report we haven't paid any claims side there. So in terms of tapping into that fund won't speculate on that and maybe, Jason on the second part. Thank you. Travis for that question, Stephanie, thanks for helping us to organize the call today. Everyone, thanks for joining for our call today. Have a safe day and fell free to ask us if you have additional questions. Thank you very much."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Matt Fallon, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nMatt Fallon: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in PG&Es fourth quarter earnings call. Joining us today are Patti Poppe, our Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the Company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's fourth quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures. The presentation can be found online along with other information at investor.pgecorp.com. We also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-Kfor the quarter ended December 31, 2021. With that I'll hand it over to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today. Our performance in 2021 confirms my confidence in our future. One, we've got the right team in place who implemented our lean operating system first, in wildfire and then across the company. Two, we've established our regional service model to deliver for our hometowns. Three, we met our major commitments in the 2021 wildfire mitigation plan by the end of the year, and implemented programs resulting in a significant reduction in wildfire risk. Four our federal probation period has ended. We're a safer company because of the improvements we've made in the past five years. We look forward to continuing to work closely with policymakers, agencies, and regulators to rebuild trust, through relentless focus on execution. We welcome the transparency and accountability that our customers should expect. And five on our financials, we delivered right on our EPS target $1 share the midpoint of our commitment for non-GAAP core earnings on a fully diluted basis. This is $1.08 on our basic share count consistent with reporting a GAAP loss. We met our commitment to you, our investors, not more not less, putting every penny to work for our customers. As you'd expect from us, we'll continue to manage the business efficiently to benefit our customers and provide predictable financial results to you, our investors every year. For 2022, our non-GAAP core EPS guidance is $1.07 to $1.13 up 7% to 13%. With a midpoint growth at 10%. Longer-term, we're focused on delivering a total return of EPS growth plus dividend yield of at least 10% per year, every year. This premium total return is driven by a simple, but affordable model that you can see on Slide 4. We're making substantial necessary investments for our customers to improve the safety, resiliency and reliability of our service, including our aggressive undergrounding plan. To mitigate the customer impact of our higher investment growth. We're planning to reduce our non-fuel O&M expense by at least 2% every year. And we're fortunate to have sales growth that accelerates over the years ahead from electric vehicles, building electrification and more. And of course, we're making smart business decisions focused on optimizing our generation sources, efficient financing, and minimizing the use of diluted equity. Longer-term, we expect the impact to our customers will be at or below inflation. Everything we've accomplished in 2021 reflects our focus on the triple bottom-line, serving people, the planet and California's prosperity underpinned by our relentless pursuit of improving our performance. We'll continue to lead by that triple bottom-line driving our performance in 2022 and beyond. Speaking of performance, to provide transparency and accountability, we'll be providing you with a report card each quarter. This is something you've been asking for and it is shown here on Slide 5. We'll provide you with specific metrics related to our wildfire efforts, our customers, and our financials. Specifically, we'll show the number of reportable ignitions. Our progress on undergrounding, gas distribution main replacements, our non-fuel O&M cost reduction, and several financial metrics. You'll see our progress across the business as we report out each quarter. Our Clear Sky playbook works. And in 2021, we experienced how powerful it can be here at PG&E. One bread and butter example is an inline inspection job that I visited a couple of weeks ago. Using our daily operating reviews and visual management tools, the project team installed 14 miles of inline inspection capability at the ribbon cutting two local mayors and city council members shared with me how satisfied they were with the work and how we showed up for our hometowns. Seamless cross functional execution that is focused on our customers. Thanks to our vast team for making it look easy. And it can be when we have an operating method that delivers consistent and predictable outcomes. Our lean playbook also drove the execution of our wildfire mitigation plan, producing great results. Last summer, we reengineered our distribution lines to shut off power within one tenth of a second when an object strip strikes the line or a fault occurs. We refer to this as enhanced powerline safety settings or EPSS. In 2021 EPSS was enabled on 45% of the lines in our high fire threat service area based on fuel risk and accessibility. To be clear, EPSS is different from our public safety power shutoff program, which is based on proactively turning off lines in dangerous fire weather conditions, primarily high winds combined with low fuel moisture levels. We're planning on expanding our EPSS program in 2022 to up to 100% of our high fire threat distribution miles. As a reminder, these settings are in place to address the risk of an ignition on a non-red Flag Warning day that also has dry conditions. The expansion of the program in 2022 provides a greater level of risk reduction. And we're also implementing enhancements to reduce the impact of EPSS on customers. As you can see on Slide 6, once we implemented our enhanced powerline safety settings, we saw an 80% reduction and ignitions on enabled circuits, which translates to a 40% reduction in ignitions, across all high fire threat districts. And as I said in 2022, we're planning to adjust the program. So all of our high fire threat distribution miles are capable of enhanced powerline safety settings. We've learned a lot from our experience last summer, and we'll use that education to guide how we engineer these settings in 2022. In addition to expanding our EPSS program in 2022, we continue to focus on our most impacted customers in our public safety power shut off or PSPS program. As a reminder, our modeling shows that the protocols we had in place for the 2021 wildfire season would have reduced the number of impacted structures from 2012 to 2020 by 96%. And due to increase sectionalization and more localized weather forecasting, our 2021 protocols reduced customer impact from PSPS by 78% this year. While we've developed an effectively scoped PSPS program, we expect this program to be less visible over time due to our focus on our enhanced vegetation management, our inspections, our repairs, our undergrounding and our micro grid work. On that last point, PG&E brought our first remote micro grid online in 2021. This solution means that an overhead line is removed in a high fire threat area keeping our customers safe. We're pursuing additional microgrid opportunities as part of our comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan in 2022. When removing a line is infeasible, there are even more exciting tools in our toolkit. What we're exploring is the full potential of distributed energy resources and bi-directional charging electric vehicles that will offer resilience options for our customers. We can eliminate the trade-off between being safe and having power. That's the future. And we're making it happen here in California. For the longer-term, we're expanding our system hardening program. Today we're providing the first look at the next five years of our undergrounding plan. Here on Slide 8. It's big and it's bold. We're moving on our commitment to underground 10,000 miles of power lines in our high fire risk areas. Undergrounding is a strong long-term solution for PG&E to reduce wildfire risk in certain parts of our service area. As well outlined in our 2022 wildfire mitigation plan, our goal is to substantially increase our underground miles each year, ramping up from 175 miles in 2022 to 1,200 miles in 2026. Of the nearly 600 miles we plan to complete by the end of 2023. Our 50% over 50% are already scoped construction ready or under construction. We'll file an update to our 2023 general rate case along with our 2022 wildfire mitigation plan on February 25 to reflect this game changing investment. And here's the good news. Undergrounding is a great example of our simple and affordable model in action. We invest in really high value capital infrastructure, and reduce our spend on temporary repairs and annual recurring expenses. Our update later this month will reflect a minimal impact to customers relative to our previous filings. As you can see on Slide 9, our capital plan is larger from 2022 to 2026 than in previous five years. The need for significant investment across the system results from many factors, including continued safety investments in our gas system, property, and building consolidations, technology adoptions to make our work more efficient, ongoing grid hardening and expansions and of course, our undergrounding plan. And as I covered earlier, we will protect our customers from energy bills they cannot afford with a cost discipline that many of you would expect. Before I hand it over to Chris, I'd like to close by reinforcing that we've met our commitments in 2021. We've laid the foundation to continue meeting our commitments in 2022. We've significantly reduced wildfire risk and are making investments that serve our triple bottom-line of people, planet and California's prosperity. Now I'll hand it over to Chris to cover financials and regulatory items.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Patti and good morning everyone. As Pattimentioned earlier, this is about operating results and financial results. We're hitting our stride on our financial outcomes creating a solid path to becoming a premium utility. This means meeting our financial targets, delivering consistent regulatory outcomes and keeping an eye on the horizon. For us, that includes an improved emphasis on customer affordability, balance sheet health, and enabling clean energy solutions for California. Today, I'll cover three topics. First, our 2021 results, which were right on target and our 2022 guidance. Second, areas of regulatory and legislative progress and third key elements of our strengthened five-year plan, which balances a range of necessary investment opportunities in our hometown, with a focus on affordability. Let me now start with our 2021 highlights, then move into greater detail. We met our non-GAAP core EPS guidance, landing at $1 for the year using our fully diluted share count assumed in our guidance or $1.08 using our basic share count, consistent with our GAAP loss. We finished the year without issuing equity. We executed our first of three AB 1054 securitization transaction. We reached settlement agreements in our 2018 SEMA and 2020 Whimsy cases, and we received a positive final outcome in our firstWEMA application. Slide 10 shows our results for both the fourth quarter and the year. Let's start with the share count used for Q4 2021 and full-year GAAP and non-GAAP core earnings per share. As you can see, we're in a small GAAP loss position for 2021 either our grantor trust election utilized for efficient tax planning. As a result of a GAAP loss, we're required to use basic shares outstanding to calculate both GAAP EPS and non-GAAP core EPS for the full-year. Our full-year guidance assumes non-GAAP core EPS of $0.95 to $1.05 per share using our fully diluted share count. So on a fully diluted basis, we landed right on our target of $1. Our GAAP positive for the quarter, so our Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP core EPS calculation reflects our fully diluted share count. Non-GAAP core earnings for the year came in at $2.1 billion. The non-core items listed here consistent with the full-year 2021 guidance range. Moving to Slide 11, this shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $596 million or $0.28 in the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the $0.11 of improvement here and in particular, the $0.02 represented by operating cost enhancements in the fourth quarter. These savings are reflective of our enhanced focus on implementing better long-term solutions, allowing us to reduce costs and resulting in a more sustainable and affordable plan for our customers. Now see a few updates on regulatory matters. On the debt side, we completed our initial AB1054 securitization transaction during Q4 2021 for $860 million. You can expect a similar transaction later this year once we work through the next regulatory proceeding. Over the next couple of years, we expect to issue total securitization under the AB1054 legislation up to $3.2 billion, and the cap that was previously established. With the timing of issuances tied to the timing of the qualified spend, we view this as an important component of the capital plan to reduce cost for customers while we invest in wildfire risk mitigation work. Our separate rate neutral securitization has also been approved by the CPUC. As a reminder, the use of proceeds from this transaction will allow us to retire $6 billion of temporary debt at the utility that has funded those payments in the interim. We are still working through the legal challenge that has been filed, we are focused on issuing the securitization quickly once it is resolved, and are hopeful to start issuing the first series as early as the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, during 2021, we continue to make progress on settling our outstanding cost recovery requests for wildfire related investments. As previously highlighted, we saw the settlement agreement for 2020 Whimsy case and we received a final decision on our first WEMA application during 2021. Additionally, on November 4, we filed the settlement with the CPUC for 90% of our requests in the 2018 CEMA case. As you can see here on Slide 12, we expect to start seeing cash flows from the settled rate cases starting this year. I also want to touch briefly on the next steps in our cost of capital proceeding. On December 24, the CPUC issued a scoping memo and the 2022 cost of capital case which narrowed the scope to review for just this year. Specifically, the CPUC will consider whether there are extraordinary events that warrant a departure from the cost of capital mechanism and whether to leave the cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for the year 2022. Additionally, the scoping memo clarifies that this proceeding does not replace a requirement to file a full application for test year 2023, which will do in April. The CPUC has not set a date for final decision and as we indicated in our application, we believe a reasonable outcome is to continue the currently authorized cost of capital because the COVID-19 pandemic and related government response warrants a departure from the cost of capital mechanism for 2022. Patti touched on our 2023 General Rate case and the updated testimony we will be filing later this month in conjunction with our 2022 wildfire mitigation plan. As a reminder, this is our first GRC in a first on a four-year cycle, and our first GRC to incorporate costs for a gas transmission and storage facilities, the scoping memo call for hearing this name and a final decision in the second quarter of 2023. Let's move to Slide 13 and look ahead to this year and the next five years, where we'll continue to focus on the triple bottom line. Guidance for 2022 represents consistency, including our focus on limiting equity needs while continuing to make progress to resolve legacy issues. For 2022, we are providing a range for non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.13 maintaining our 10% earnings per share growth. For 2022, we estimate our equity issuance needs in the range of $100 million to $400 million. As Patti touched on, we have substantially updated our five-year plan. Let's go ahead and move to Slide 14 where we provide our refreshed 2022 to 2026 projections. There's much to share in this improved plan, including earnings per share growth will continue on the 10% path in the near-term and we'll transition into an EPS growth plus dividend yield of at least 10% as we grow into our dividend upon reinstatement. Our rate base CAGR goes from 8.5% to 9%. This growth includes our current estimates over this period including the kicking off of our undergrounding program. This plan is consistent with what will be reflected in our upcoming February 25 filings, it also includes investments in remote grids, and system modernization to expand our preparedness for electrification. We also retain our commitment to reducing debt at the holding company in the coming years, with targeted reductions of $2 billion by the end of 2023. The continued suspension of the common stock dividend will support these debt reductions. The overall financing plan has been developed with our long-term FFO to debt targets in mind as we look to achieve mid to high teens levels in 2024. As Patti mentioned, our capital investment program is focused sharply on critical customer needs. We can finance this and make it affordable for our customers. And we intend to manage this over time to maintain customer impacts around the level of inflation in California. Starting this year, we plan to reduce non-fuel O&M costs by 2% every year. Our O&M costs used to increase every year. And over time we anticipate low growth due to electrification to help spread our costs over a larger base. And we'll make good business decisions to more efficiently provide generation and more efficiently finance the enterprise. This enhanced approach for us at PG&E helps us deliver for our hometowns and for our investors. We'll execute against this five year plan using our lean operating system, where we can better seek out waste elimination, and make the work easier for our co-workers. There's a lot of work to do and it can be done more simply. We've already seen success in 2021. Recall that we targeted savings of roughly $1 billion each year. The outcome for 2021 had us at roughly $1.6 billion in savings. We achieved savings well above that prior target of $1 billion reflecting good business decisions with improved unit cost performance and transactional savings. The operational savings achieved this year include around $560 million from the efficiencies gained by renegotiating electric construction contracts with third-parties, among other efforts, and we're just getting started. As a team, we are determined to execute well on both the operational and financial plan, we set out to benefit all components of the triple bottom line, and drive prosperity for our state, and investors. I'll close by reiterating that we've delivered against the financial plan for 2021. Our focus has been and will continue to be on addressing the critical need to reduce wildfire risk in the near-term, while running the business effectively for the long-term. Our stronger five year plan puts us on that path. We're investing in needed wildfire mitigation, improving our balance sheet, and making the right investments to deliver clean energy safely to our customers. With that, I'll go and hand it back to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Chris. And as we've discussed, a lot has happened here at PG&E in 2021 to create the launching pad for 2022. As most of you know, I like to tell stories. So here we go. I have one more. A couple weeks ago, on one of my field visits, I stopped at our service center in Auburn. I heard a familiar story from one of our co-workers who lives in Placer County with the PG&E distribution line on his property. Due to various work processes that should have been coordinated, he has had Inspectors on his property four times, three crews on his property three times, and wood management crews another three times, that is 10 visits in a little over a year. Now right after I grown in frustration, I clap and I say okay, team that's upside, let's go on this job, we could have reduced our costs by 20% simply by having a better work plan. Similar jobs in 2021 cost PG&E a billion dollars. Just think of how much better we can do and how our customers will benefit as we reduce the waste and therefore the cost in our processes. I feel that momentum and potential every day. That's just one opportunity of many that I've encountered in my time here at PG&E. Opportunities to reduce costs, opportunities to improve our customer relationships, opportunities to deliver as the hometown team. We're excited about what we've accomplished in 2021 and where we're going in 2022 and beyond, we're further mitigating wildfire risk by expanding our enhanced powerline safety setting program and launching our undergrounding initiative. We've got the right operating system in place to deliver industry leading financial growth fueled by the important safety and resiliency driven infrastructure investments funded by our cost savings, our growing load, and good management practices to keep customer bills affordable. This is a new era at PG&E without trade-offs. We can serve customers, and you, our investors without a compromise. Thank you all for your time. And thank you for supporting the great work being done here at PG&E. Operator, please open the line for questions-and-answers.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We had the first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nSteve Fleishman: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just on the -- a couple questions on the undergrounding plan with how should we think about -- how much you might actually be doing the work before you have full the pre-approval for it? And just how you're thinking about that?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, Hi, Steve. Nice to hear your voice. Well, we have already approved filings for our hardening work. And so we're biasing the plans now to include more undergrounding we have 211 or we have 14 miles done to-date already this year, which we're excited about. We continue to make progress. We have -- so as we look forward to future filings, we'll continue to and you'll see in our wildfire mitigation plan, which we file, February 25, what our plan is for the future of undergrounding year-by-year as we've described in the deck today, but that will then be approved in the coming years. We've actually been asked to update the GRC to reflect the inclusion of undergrounding. And I think the part that's most exciting for people is that we can make those additional undergrounding miles when we factored into our total capital plan with minimal impact on our original filing in terms of costs for customers. And so we can both make it safe and keep it affordable. And we're excited about that progress.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. And just could you maybe give a little more color on when you look at the five year plan on undergrounding. Years three to five starts becoming pretty big, pretty big numbers and capital. Just how you're thinking about funding it? And are you looking at kind of something other than straight balance sheet financing?\nChris Foster: Sure, hi, Steve. It's a couple things we're looking at there. As you can imagine the equity driver itself is going to ultimately depend on where we end up on that CapEx. But it's just stepping back, you can imagine we do have a couple of levers as we look forward. First is going to be the amount of holding company debt that we retain is one lever that gives us some good flexibility in those outer years. I think the second would be just the assumption for how quickly we choose to ramp up the dividend. So we're giving ourselves I think, some good levers there in the out years to kind of try to manage any potential, any financing pressures.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then one other just technical question, the $5 million GAAP loss for '21. Does that mean you're not eligible for S&P 500 inclusion until we get passed the next quarter?\nChris Foster: Sure, Steve happy to clarify that. When we did have a GAAP loss in Q3, right, that we had pointed to was going to occur? We have a positive Q4, right. So that would mean that the most recent quarter is GAAP positive, as it's looked at by S&P. So really, the two metrics that we've got to meet at this stage are the most recent quarter being GAAP positive. And the sum of the four most recent quarters GAAP positive in terms of the ability to have S&P inclusion. And then it's really just the qualitative factors, it's harder to put a timeline on, as you could imagine, which is another entity has to fall out of the S&P for us to have eligibility to go in.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. But just to clarify that second piece that because this is the last four quarters this year that you don't meet that second metrics are going to wait for at least maybe the next quarter to meet that?\nChris Foster: That's a fair assumption. Yes, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nJonathan Arnold: Hi, good morning guys.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning, Jonathan.\nJonathan Arnold: This one I think from the footnote to the slide that says you're effectively assuming current cost of capital and equity ratio across the business in your '22 guidance. So I wanted to verify that that's correct. And secondly, just to sort of how you thinking about potentially different outcomes there and how that would sort of fall within the range that you've given us? Would you be able to expect to be able to offset that. Would you expect to be able to be still delivering at 10% through pulling other levers and maybe that?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, great question, Jonathan. As you might expect, Jonathan, there's lots of puts and takes in any given year, and this is one. And we would expect to find another way to achieve our financial commitments. And so are -- we're planning conservatively putting into -- putting together plans in the event that the cost of capital proceeding does not go the way that we think it should. We're very optimistic about our filing and things that we've made a compelling argument. But of course, we'll plan accordingly. As I like to say Jonathan we'll ride the roller coaster, so you don't have to.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one other thing, you -- that's 2% to 4% sort of longer-term customer rate. I guess those customer bill impact. I think you've described that as longer term is, could we talk a little about the near-term, and how that sort of calibrate against that broader target?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, as you can imagine, we've got a lot of plans in place that we're working to reduce our O&M and reduce our cost structure. We do have our current rate filing as already in flight for the next four years, as we look at what the rate implications of that filing. It's on average, about 4% per year. It tapers down in the latter half of the plan, and we expect to continue to be able to build this muscle to keep our rates affordable. We do think that our rates are affordable, we believe that our -- the value offer to customers is significant. And so it's truly on us to continue to make the business more efficient, find ways of reducing costs, and one of the things I'm excited about here in California is actual load growth. That's a nice phenomenon. And we see what electric vehicles, electrification, as well as customer growth. We've got a lot of opportunities here to continue to grow in California, that's another offset to unit costs for customers going forward. So this is an important muscle for us to develop here at PG&E. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I see lots of opportunity everywhere I go across the system for ways that we can improve the customer experience and reduce the cost to deliver.\nJonathan Arnold: Great, okay, thank you. And then maybe one quick follow-up. Something you said, Chris, to Steve. You talked about how quickly you ramp up the dividends being a lever you can pull for financing, incremental capital. Would you -- I that would appear to imply you still anticipate starting it, in that kind of mid next year timeframe, assuming that earnings play out the way they versus the cumulative target I guess?\nChris Foster: That's accurate, Jonathan. We'd still be looking at a situation where we'll hit that $6.2 billion and non-GAAP core earnings threshold that allow us to turn it back on. I just think at this stage, you can imagine I can't really get ahead of the decision will be making with the board on the exact level of reinstatement. But we would certainly be eligible again, roughly mid next year, and looking forward to being able to turn it back on. But as you can imagine, just given the plants in front of us we will be -- it's safe to assume right, we'd be growing into that dividend.\nJonathan Arnold: For sure. Okay. Thank you.\nChris Foster: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. You may ask the question.\nConstantine Lednev: Good morning team. This is actually Constantine here for Shar. Congrats on all the accomplishments in '21.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning. Thank you.\nConstantine Lednev: As we're thinking about the undergrounding that that you're presenting today. And can you elaborate on the inputs from any kind of bids or RFIs that drove the formation of the 3,600 target? And the kind of cost levels that you're presenting? How does that fit within the 10,000 mile goal previously stated? And you see some opportunities to improve or accelerate without crowding any investment?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, great question. We have a couple things. We have current active undergrounding projects as we speak, and they range in their cost to complete. And we have some that are today in the $2 million a mile range. We have some that are more than that. And so we're working to find the best methods and systems. We don't have a unit cost negotiated yet with a contractor for the full scope of the 10,000 miles. We're working on identifying what is that path forward. But one of the things that's exciting about the RFI that we did conduct a request for information. We got a lot of new technologies that are being deployed across the globe, presented to us here. For example, some boring equipment that's being used in Germany to underground transmission lines. It's pretty exciting stuff which gives us confidence as we ramp up and scale this program with the right equipment, with the right partners, with the right work process. We can dramatically reduce our costs every year on the undergrounding scope and scale. So we have a lot more meat to put on the bones as we move forward. But again, we'll share more specifics on our cost forecasts and the near-term plans with our wildfire mitigation plan, we're filing on the 25th of February.\nChris Foster: And if I could just build on that Constantine. We really don't see this as crowding out the work right. Well, the beauty of this is that, as Patty mentioned earlier, we've already got that ability in the underlying generate case, and in our subsequent rate case to put forward system hardening investments. So we're going to pull out some of what would previously have been the overhead line miles we would have been putting in and are putting in better risk reduction with the undergrounding mileage or putting it instead. So the risk of inefficiency is better, the safety for our customers is improved. And ultimately, what you'll see is we're also going to have a true up that goes in alongside that wildfire mitigation plan filing on February 25th. That trip will show you that in the end, this is really where the rubber meets the road that will -- you'll be able to put forward a plan, there's minimal impact to customers, while still going after this aggressive undergrounding effort on behalf of our customers in the state.\nConstantine Lednev: That's excellent color. I appreciate that very much. And as you noted in the multi-year financial plan. Can you elaborate on the drivers for the 10% ETFs and dividend yield? And how does that incorporate the new 9% rate base growth and financing needs versus prior guidance? And are there any assumptions in there around reinstating the dividend?\nChris Foster: Sure thing. We do definitely have a high level assumption that within the details of the five year plan. Certainly can't drive a specificity today. If we have just made that assumption, don't want to again want to get ahead of that decision by management and the board. But what I would offer is, again, you can see this year that we certainly we're already kicking off a substantial doubling or more than doubling of undergrounding mileage in terms of that effort, as well as continuing our key safety and reliability investments. Got a moderate equity need that we disclose today. And our goal again, going forward, Constantine would be to ensure that we're finding that right balance. And that's going to be about making sure that we're pulling forward the work to get the work done efficiently. But doing so in a way that's from a financing standpoint, efficient as we go.\nConstantine Lednev: Excellent. And a very quick follow-up on a related note. In terms of the own end profile and the 2% target. Is that something the cadence to the reductions, especially as you start seeing some benefits around WMP and undergrounding in the tail end versus the front end of the plan?\nPatricia Poppe: Now we're shooting Constantine to do our goal is to shoot for 2% a year. We're going to work that every year. There's a lot of efforts and underway and a lot of opportunities that we see going forward. So we're going to work that every year. Though your intuition is right underground is a perfect example of that simple and affordable model. It's capital intensive, because it's the right kind of long-term infrastructure that the system needs to be resilient in these conditions here in California, and reduces then the need to rely on annual vegetation management and other annual expenses. So we really have the opportunity here to demonstrate our simple and affordable model through undergrounding. So you're spot on that.\nConstantine Lednev: Excellent. And I appreciate you taking the questions today and congrats on a good year.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Constantine. See you soon.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks so much for the time.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Julien. Nice to hear your voice.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Likewise. So just on this 2% non-fuel O&M cost reduction, what's the gross number? What's the starting point that you're starting with offsetting here? Just want to understand how meaningful of a program that you've got underway? I know you, you threw out the billion dollar number of cost savings at least on just work process here at the outset and in the script. But just high level, how much inflation are you otherwise looking at to offset here's a baseline results at a net minus two here?\nChris Foster: Sure, thank you. It's substantial. Again, previously, but we got it to was taking that roughly billion dollars out of the business a year. Our target last year was a billion we came through at 1.6. We're pivoting now to this non-fuel O&M view, which we'll be all in think about it is roughly a total of $10 billion amount that we'll be working down right over time. So 2% year-over-year, no matter where inflation stands, right. Our focus is going to be taking out that 2% productivity levels to it to improve themselves, as well as you heard us mention some of these large contracting efforts, being ones where we can take out in some cases as we did last year, hundreds of millions of dollars in costs as we go. So that's really going to be the focus of the enterprise. Year-over-year productivity in the field, as well as making sure from a sourcing in and contracting standpoint, we're really doing our best to get the best pricing possible.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And speaking of getting the best pricing possible here. I mean, how much confidence, I think about the confidence intervals in terms of achieving the new undergrounding cost metrics per mile that you've laid out both near-term and long-term. I mean how much confidence can you have in those numbers, just considering the amount of inflation and inflation in some of the input commodities here? And how do you think about potentially putting parameters or hedging around those, especially through near, medium term work here?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, I think our contracting strategy on our undergrounding work is going to obviously be very important. And we'll be working that out in the coming months. We have confidence, Julien, because we're doing it today, we have projects that are coming in at $2 million a mile today. And that's with what I would say, very rudimentary methods, that we haven't deployed the best technology because we don't have the scale to deploy the technology. In fact, I was out on a job. And I was talking to one of our providers of the trenching equipment. And I said to him, hey, is this your best stuff that we're using? He said, Heck, no, I have much better equipment that we could be using. I said, well, why isn't he here? He said, because you don't have scale. You're not running enough miles underground to make it work for me to bring my best equipment and scale up. And I can help reduce the cost and the speed and the time to deliver. So it's pretty interesting. I go back to my old school industrial engineering, Julien and I know that with scale, we can improve the unit cost. So knowing that we can do $2 million a mile on certain jobs today, I know at scale, we can do that with the right equipment, process, partners and work plan.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: And so just to clarify, have you run these numbers by the commission staff, et cetera, just in terms of the new cost metrics that you've talked about today? I know that this has been a gradual unveil, if you will.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, we've certainly had conversations with staff about our plans and where we're headed, but our formal filing comes on February 25. And that's when we'll get formal feedback from all the key stakeholders.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right, well, we'll wait for that. Thank you again. Best of luck. See you soon here.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I actually had a couple things. One is really a semantic or language question, which is in your text around the EPS CAGR, this is the first time I think where you refer to it as kind of a total return proposition long-term. So EPS plus a yield, I go back and look at the third quarter decks and some of the ones previously, it was just an EPS CAGR. No mention about combo yield. I know that's a really small difference. Can you just walk us through, what drove that language change?\nChris Foster: No, absolutely, Michael and good to hear from you. This is absolutely one of the key components of the five-year plan. I'd really think about it. And that's one I think there's probably three things we're really focused on today. The first is shifting from that EPS CAGR generically to a total return scenario where as we turn the dividend back on right and we will grow that dividend toward the back half of those years, we're looking instead of just that generic EPS guide as a CAGR, what we're saying is a consistent 10% return at least over that time period. So it's a significant shift. I think the second is our increased focus on costs and cost efficiencies, right. Previously, when we last guided on overall customer bill impact trajectory, we were talking in the neighborhood of roughly 5%. But we're talking about today as Patti mentioned, is closer to 4%. And we're going to keep working that down. And I think the third piece is just the underlying risk reduction is what we're trying to convey today, the body of work is going to mean better risk reduction in the near-term, which is the very large expansion of our EPSS program, which is immediate risk reduction, once we get that ready on the system, and through the long-term risk reduction that comes from undergrounding. So those are really the three key components of the financial planning operating plan.\nMichael Lapides: Right, I just want to come back to the EPS CAGR portion of it, and I hate to harp on this, but if this is now including a 10% total return projection like that's the long-term goal, but it includes a dividend yield, did you and that basically imply relative to what you put out at second quarter and third quarter as kind of a 10% EPS CAGR that that you're basically reducing the EPS CAGR because part of that total return if I'm kind of moving towards 10% is the eventual future of dividend yield?\nChris Foster: That's essentially correct, Michael, again, we're really shifting ultimately to the total return model. We're going to reinvest in the enterprise where we need to keep costs low, and put ourselves in line with premium peers at a total return level.\nMichael Lapides: Got it, and then one thing just from the customer bill, can you -- commodity prices are up. I know you all have control over a lot of things in the bill, you also don't have, there are a lot of things in the bill, your payables in the K are great on that, that you don't really have as much control of, can you talk about just over the next year or so what the move in commodities has done to the total bill?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, so as we look at particularly natural gas, that's been a big driver, we're proud of the fact that we've been able to minimize the impact to customers on that when some of the commodity prices are up 90%, we've been able to protect our customers closer to a 10% to 12% impact of the commodity. And that's because we've got good storage resources, we have a really aggressive purchasing strategy so that we prevent those big real time spikes from hitting our customers.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Patti. Thank you, Chris. Much appreciate it, guys.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you.\nChris Foster: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may ask a question.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning. It's actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy, can you hear me?\nPatricia Poppe: We sure can. Good morning.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, thanks. Maybe just starting around the 2022 equity, can you speak to your timing expectations they are and what drives the high and low ends of the range?\nChris Foster: Sure, happy to cover it for you at this point nothing specific on timing, just because again, if you can imagine we're always trying to taking conservative look at this Rich. Last year, as you recall, right, we had guided to zero to 400, pleased that we landed at zero last year. Ultimately, what we're looking at are a couple of drivers. First would be at its highest order. We're going to continue to work through legacy wildfire cases, right. We've got the commitment there to ensure we're continuing to make progress for the communities on individual claims that are there. I think the other one is just going to be assumptions on some of the recoveries that we've got here and the materials that we're showcasing today for prior wildfire recoveries as well. So in line at this point for the appropriate timing on proposed decisions, prior recoveries, and we'll continue to work our way through some of the legacy claims as well.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Thanks for the color there. And then just thinking about the expanded EPSS. How do you see an interplay with PSPS use this year, just how do you see that wider rollout impacting the need to implement PSPS?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, it's a great question. We're continuing to learn and optimize these and both of those very important tools. I do want to remind and thanks for the prompt here Rich, I want to remind everyone listening that the system is safer today, because we know that we can rely on PSPS and EPSS under multitude of conditions. Regardless of weather, regardless of drought, we can protect our customers. Now we know that PSPS is a tool of last resort, and we only use it when the conditions warrant but we do have a model that when we look rearward, and we can see the previous -- our current algorithm against previous conditions, we would have prevented 96% of structures loss between 2012 and 2020. That is a significant safety mitigation. But we're pretty excited about EPSS. And what we learned last year, and the dramatic reduction in admissions on those circuits where we enabled EPSS. So keep in mind EPSS is enabled, even on a dry -- on a non-windy day, on a non-Red Flag Day when we know the conditions are ripe for a fire spread, we can enable those settings and we're in the process of engineering and preparing to have 100% of our high fire threat miles able to utilize the EPSS standard. So that's pretty exciting for us. I think it's an important combination of risk against that really enable us to keep people safe today.\nRichard Sunderland: Great, thanks for the time today.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, thank you, Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill of UBS. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nGregg Orrill: Yes, thank you.\nPatricia Poppe: Hi, Greg.\nGregg Orrill: I was wondering, hi Patti. I was wondering if you could come back to the rate neutral securitization and sort of how you're thinking about the steps there and the timing for implementing that?\nChris Foster: Sure thing, Hi, Greg. Looking basically at this point is just a reminder, this is at this stage already has had two approvals at the CPUC F5 nothing though. And so we're currently in the appeals process through the courts at this stage, currently looking at the earliest Q2 execution timeframe, just in terms of what we're seeing the appeals process kind of work its way through, still intend to execute this year, allowing us to take out that $6 billion in operating company.\nGregg Orrill: Thank you.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Greg.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question we have the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. You may ask the question.\nStephen Byrd: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPatricia Poppe: Hey, Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: I wanted to just talk about EPSS expansion in 2022 and just wanted to check in terms of whether there are any approvals or other processes or do you feel fairly confident that that should be relatively straightforward to roll out more broadly in '22?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, we will obviously file as part of our wildfire mitigation plan, we are moving forward and enabling the circuits. Some of the challenges we had early last year, when we did what we call our Hotline tag process, which is different than our full EPS engineered, coordinated settings that we're installing now, they had a significant impact on a small handful of customers who had multiple outages that were long, because it would take out a really long stretch of a circuit. And we'd have to patrol it to make sure that it was safe before we re-energized, we've much dramatically improved our ability to address those challenges by coordinating the settings, engineering it so that a much smaller portion of the line is de-energized when it's made contact with something, whether it's a tree or an animal, that would cause a spark, we are de-energizing a 10th of a second, which is incredible. But then much shorter spans of line. So the patrol is much faster, and the restoration is much faster. And so certainly we work with our regulators to make sure they're comfortable with our approach here. And that filing will reflect that. But we're pretty bullish that this is a very, very important transformation of the safety and de-risking of our system on behalf of customers. And that that is something we're pretty excited about.\nStephen Byrd: Well, that's helpful color. And then just one other for me, on the load growth discussion that you all laid out, you all laid out 1% to 3% load growth, how do you think about the impending factor in I guess the impacts of potential customer loss of load from distribute generation, whether it's for commercial customers, residential, et cetera, how does that factor into your thinking on load growth?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, so when we're talking about load growth, we're talking about wires growth, we do see that distributed solar actually is an important part of the mix here in California, both from a resiliency perspective, as well as that a peak mitigation particularly when combined with storage, which Stephen, you and I have talked about EVs many times. But I'm pretty excited about the bi directional charging capacity of these new electric vehicles that are on the road today. And the combination of that storage with distributed energy. And certainly has an impact you could describe on load, but I think of it much more as a key enabler to the kind of supply that customers want, that's resilient, that can serve a peak demand and reduce the number of flex alerts we have here in California and make our supply more reliable, and at the same time electrification, and those EVs still does grow demand. So net-net, that's where we come out on this 1% to 3% over time of electric load growth, even with those distributed resources. It's a pretty exciting combination of technologies.\nStephen Byrd: Great, thank you very much.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Stephen.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question we have the line of Mr. Ryan Levine of Citi. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nRyan Levine: Good morning.\nPatricia Poppe: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan Levine: Hi, how's it determined that the target 3600 underground mileage for undergrounding is appropriate that was laid out in the plan today? Is there any color you're able to share?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, as we've mentioned publicly, we've announced that we're going to do 10,000 miles. And so what we have challenged ourselves and what we're forecasting we're going to do is essentially doubling the miles every year. So in 2020, we did 75 miles in 2022, or in 2021, we did 75 miles, in 2022, we are shooting for 175. And then we'll grow that double, double, double each year until we get up to about that 1,200 range, which we think would be a reasonable level. Now I say all that to say, we have to prove that out, we have to do it. We have to actually execute on those plans and we felt like that was the sort of ramp given the feedback we've received or requests for information from global contractors that we could conceivably deliver. But obviously that all have to be approved through our regulatory filings and more to come on that as we work with key stakeholders across the state to make sure that that plan is one that everyone supports.\nRyan Levine: Thanks. And then a follow-up, what would be the timeline for PG&E to get more concrete bids on the cost of undergrounding given the more information that was received at this point?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, that'll be coming in the coming months, we've got to first align with stakeholders on the volume we're looking at. And we'll do the bids. And we'll have a pretty comprehensive contracting strategy for how we'll complete that work and with whom will partner and what portions of that we will in-source, what we will outsource et cetera. We're building out that plan as we speak.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate the color, thank you.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Ryan.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further question at this time. I would now like to turn the call over back to Ms. Patti Poppe.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Mel. Thank you, everyone again, for joining us today. You know, I just want to reiterate that we have really taken very positive steps forward on our wildfire risk. The combination of EPSS and PSPS in the near-term today makes the system safer, hardening the system, reimagining it with undergrounding as our really backbone of our hardening program going forward gives us a lot of confidence going forward on our ability to keep people safe. I think the other thing I really want to leave you with is that our simple but affordable model is the past to both keep people safe and to deliver for investors. So we think there's no trade-off here, we can have the important capital work done offset by cost savings and load growth and other smart management techniques, we will work to deliver for customers every single day and for you delivering predictable outcomes for investors. This is a near era for PG&A and we can't wait to take the right along with you. So thanks so much for tuning in today. Be safe out there.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti and good morning everyone. As Pattimentioned earlier, this is about operating results and financial results. We're hitting our stride on our financial outcomes creating a solid path to becoming a premium utility. This means meeting our financial targets, delivering consistent regulatory outcomes and keeping an eye on the horizon. For us, that includes an improved emphasis on customer affordability, balance sheet health, and enabling clean energy solutions for California. Today, I'll cover three topics. First, our 2021 results, which were right on target and our 2022 guidance. Second, areas of regulatory and legislative progress and third key elements of our strengthened five-year plan, which balances a range of necessary investment opportunities in our hometown, with a focus on affordability. Let me now start with our 2021 highlights, then move into greater detail. We met our non-GAAP core EPS guidance, landing at $1 for the year using our fully diluted share count assumed in our guidance or $1.08 using our basic share count, consistent with our GAAP loss. We finished the year without issuing equity. We executed our first of three AB 1054 securitization transaction. We reached settlement agreements in our 2018 SEMA and 2020 Whimsy cases, and we received a positive final outcome in our firstWEMA application. Slide 10 shows our results for both the fourth quarter and the year. Let's start with the share count used for Q4 2021 and full-year GAAP and non-GAAP core earnings per share. As you can see, we're in a small GAAP loss position for 2021 either our grantor trust election utilized for efficient tax planning. As a result of a GAAP loss, we're required to use basic shares outstanding to calculate both GAAP EPS and non-GAAP core EPS for the full-year. Our full-year guidance assumes non-GAAP core EPS of $0.95 to $1.05 per share using our fully diluted share count. So on a fully diluted basis, we landed right on our target of $1. Our GAAP positive for the quarter, so our Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP core EPS calculation reflects our fully diluted share count. Non-GAAP core earnings for the year came in at $2.1 billion. The non-core items listed here consistent with the full-year 2021 guidance range. Moving to Slide 11, this shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $596 million or $0.28 in the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the $0.11 of improvement here and in particular, the $0.02 represented by operating cost enhancements in the fourth quarter. These savings are reflective of our enhanced focus on implementing better long-term solutions, allowing us to reduce costs and resulting in a more sustainable and affordable plan for our customers. Now see a few updates on regulatory matters. On the debt side, we completed our initial AB1054 securitization transaction during Q4 2021 for $860 million. You can expect a similar transaction later this year once we work through the next regulatory proceeding. Over the next couple of years, we expect to issue total securitization under the AB1054 legislation up to $3.2 billion, and the cap that was previously established. With the timing of issuances tied to the timing of the qualified spend, we view this as an important component of the capital plan to reduce cost for customers while we invest in wildfire risk mitigation work. Our separate rate neutral securitization has also been approved by the CPUC. As a reminder, the use of proceeds from this transaction will allow us to retire $6 billion of temporary debt at the utility that has funded those payments in the interim. We are still working through the legal challenge that has been filed, we are focused on issuing the securitization quickly once it is resolved, and are hopeful to start issuing the first series as early as the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, during 2021, we continue to make progress on settling our outstanding cost recovery requests for wildfire related investments. As previously highlighted, we saw the settlement agreement for 2020 Whimsy case and we received a final decision on our first WEMA application during 2021. Additionally, on November 4, we filed the settlement with the CPUC for 90% of our requests in the 2018 CEMA case. As you can see here on Slide 12, we expect to start seeing cash flows from the settled rate cases starting this year. I also want to touch briefly on the next steps in our cost of capital proceeding. On December 24, the CPUC issued a scoping memo and the 2022 cost of capital case which narrowed the scope to review for just this year. Specifically, the CPUC will consider whether there are extraordinary events that warrant a departure from the cost of capital mechanism and whether to leave the cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for the year 2022. Additionally, the scoping memo clarifies that this proceeding does not replace a requirement to file a full application for test year 2023, which will do in April. The CPUC has not set a date for final decision and as we indicated in our application, we believe a reasonable outcome is to continue the currently authorized cost of capital because the COVID-19 pandemic and related government response warrants a departure from the cost of capital mechanism for 2022. Patti touched on our 2023 General Rate case and the updated testimony we will be filing later this month in conjunction with our 2022 wildfire mitigation plan. As a reminder, this is our first GRC in a first on a four-year cycle, and our first GRC to incorporate costs for a gas transmission and storage facilities, the scoping memo call for hearing this name and a final decision in the second quarter of 2023. Let's move to Slide 13 and look ahead to this year and the next five years, where we'll continue to focus on the triple bottom line. Guidance for 2022 represents consistency, including our focus on limiting equity needs while continuing to make progress to resolve legacy issues. For 2022, we are providing a range for non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.13 maintaining our 10% earnings per share growth. For 2022, we estimate our equity issuance needs in the range of $100 million to $400 million. As Patti touched on, we have substantially updated our five-year plan. Let's go ahead and move to Slide 14 where we provide our refreshed 2022 to 2026 projections. There's much to share in this improved plan, including earnings per share growth will continue on the 10% path in the near-term and we'll transition into an EPS growth plus dividend yield of at least 10% as we grow into our dividend upon reinstatement. Our rate base CAGR goes from 8.5% to 9%. This growth includes our current estimates over this period including the kicking off of our undergrounding program. This plan is consistent with what will be reflected in our upcoming February 25 filings, it also includes investments in remote grids, and system modernization to expand our preparedness for electrification. We also retain our commitment to reducing debt at the holding company in the coming years, with targeted reductions of $2 billion by the end of 2023. The continued suspension of the common stock dividend will support these debt reductions. The overall financing plan has been developed with our long-term FFO to debt targets in mind as we look to achieve mid to high teens levels in 2024. As Patti mentioned, our capital investment program is focused sharply on critical customer needs. We can finance this and make it affordable for our customers. And we intend to manage this over time to maintain customer impacts around the level of inflation in California. Starting this year, we plan to reduce non-fuel O&M costs by 2% every year. Our O&M costs used to increase every year. And over time we anticipate low growth due to electrification to help spread our costs over a larger base. And we'll make good business decisions to more efficiently provide generation and more efficiently finance the enterprise. This enhanced approach for us at PG&E helps us deliver for our hometowns and for our investors. We'll execute against this five year plan using our lean operating system, where we can better seek out waste elimination, and make the work easier for our co-workers. There's a lot of work to do and it can be done more simply. We've already seen success in 2021. Recall that we targeted savings of roughly $1 billion each year. The outcome for 2021 had us at roughly $1.6 billion in savings. We achieved savings well above that prior target of $1 billion reflecting good business decisions with improved unit cost performance and transactional savings. The operational savings achieved this year include around $560 million from the efficiencies gained by renegotiating electric construction contracts with third-parties, among other efforts, and we're just getting started. As a team, we are determined to execute well on both the operational and financial plan, we set out to benefit all components of the triple bottom line, and drive prosperity for our state, and investors. I'll close by reiterating that we've delivered against the financial plan for 2021. Our focus has been and will continue to be on addressing the critical need to reduce wildfire risk in the near-term, while running the business effectively for the long-term. Our stronger five year plan puts us on that path. We're investing in needed wildfire mitigation, improving our balance sheet, and making the right investments to deliver clean energy safely to our customers. With that, I'll go and hand it back to Patti. Sure, hi, Steve. It's a couple things we're looking at there. As you can imagine the equity driver itself is going to ultimately depend on where we end up on that CapEx. But it's just stepping back, you can imagine we do have a couple of levers as we look forward. First is going to be the amount of holding company debt that we retain is one lever that gives us some good flexibility in those outer years. I think the second would be just the assumption for how quickly we choose to ramp up the dividend. So we're giving ourselves I think, some good levers there in the out years to kind of try to manage any potential, any financing pressures. Sure, Steve happy to clarify that. When we did have a GAAP loss in Q3, right, that we had pointed to was going to occur? We have a positive Q4, right. So that would mean that the most recent quarter is GAAP positive, as it's looked at by S&P. So really, the two metrics that we've got to meet at this stage are the most recent quarter being GAAP positive. And the sum of the four most recent quarters GAAP positive in terms of the ability to have S&P inclusion. And then it's really just the qualitative factors, it's harder to put a timeline on, as you could imagine, which is another entity has to fall out of the S&P for us to have eligibility to go in. That's a fair assumption. Yes, Steve. That's accurate, Jonathan. We'd still be looking at a situation where we'll hit that $6.2 billion and non-GAAP core earnings threshold that allow us to turn it back on. I just think at this stage, you can imagine I can't really get ahead of the decision will be making with the board on the exact level of reinstatement. But we would certainly be eligible again, roughly mid next year, and looking forward to being able to turn it back on. But as you can imagine, just given the plants in front of us we will be -- it's safe to assume right, we'd be growing into that dividend. Thank you. And if I could just build on that Constantine. We really don't see this as crowding out the work right. Well, the beauty of this is that, as Patty mentioned earlier, we've already got that ability in the underlying generate case, and in our subsequent rate case to put forward system hardening investments. So we're going to pull out some of what would previously have been the overhead line miles we would have been putting in and are putting in better risk reduction with the undergrounding mileage or putting it instead. So the risk of inefficiency is better, the safety for our customers is improved. And ultimately, what you'll see is we're also going to have a true up that goes in alongside that wildfire mitigation plan filing on February 25th. That trip will show you that in the end, this is really where the rubber meets the road that will -- you'll be able to put forward a plan, there's minimal impact to customers, while still going after this aggressive undergrounding effort on behalf of our customers in the state. Sure thing. We do definitely have a high level assumption that within the details of the five year plan. Certainly can't drive a specificity today. If we have just made that assumption, don't want to again want to get ahead of that decision by management and the board. But what I would offer is, again, you can see this year that we certainly we're already kicking off a substantial doubling or more than doubling of undergrounding mileage in terms of that effort, as well as continuing our key safety and reliability investments. Got a moderate equity need that we disclose today. And our goal again, going forward, Constantine would be to ensure that we're finding that right balance. And that's going to be about making sure that we're pulling forward the work to get the work done efficiently. But doing so in a way that's from a financing standpoint, efficient as we go. Sure, thank you. It's substantial. Again, previously, but we got it to was taking that roughly billion dollars out of the business a year. Our target last year was a billion we came through at 1.6. We're pivoting now to this non-fuel O&M view, which we'll be all in think about it is roughly a total of $10 billion amount that we'll be working down right over time. So 2% year-over-year, no matter where inflation stands, right. Our focus is going to be taking out that 2% productivity levels to it to improve themselves, as well as you heard us mention some of these large contracting efforts, being ones where we can take out in some cases as we did last year, hundreds of millions of dollars in costs as we go. So that's really going to be the focus of the enterprise. Year-over-year productivity in the field, as well as making sure from a sourcing in and contracting standpoint, we're really doing our best to get the best pricing possible. No, absolutely, Michael and good to hear from you. This is absolutely one of the key components of the five-year plan. I'd really think about it. And that's one I think there's probably three things we're really focused on today. The first is shifting from that EPS CAGR generically to a total return scenario where as we turn the dividend back on right and we will grow that dividend toward the back half of those years, we're looking instead of just that generic EPS guide as a CAGR, what we're saying is a consistent 10% return at least over that time period. So it's a significant shift. I think the second is our increased focus on costs and cost efficiencies, right. Previously, when we last guided on overall customer bill impact trajectory, we were talking in the neighborhood of roughly 5%. But we're talking about today as Patti mentioned, is closer to 4%. And we're going to keep working that down. And I think the third piece is just the underlying risk reduction is what we're trying to convey today, the body of work is going to mean better risk reduction in the near-term, which is the very large expansion of our EPSS program, which is immediate risk reduction, once we get that ready on the system, and through the long-term risk reduction that comes from undergrounding. So those are really the three key components of the financial planning operating plan. That's essentially correct, Michael, again, we're really shifting ultimately to the total return model. We're going to reinvest in the enterprise where we need to keep costs low, and put ourselves in line with premium peers at a total return level. Thanks, Michael. Sure, happy to cover it for you at this point nothing specific on timing, just because again, if you can imagine we're always trying to taking conservative look at this Rich. Last year, as you recall, right, we had guided to zero to 400, pleased that we landed at zero last year. Ultimately, what we're looking at are a couple of drivers. First would be at its highest order. We're going to continue to work through legacy wildfire cases, right. We've got the commitment there to ensure we're continuing to make progress for the communities on individual claims that are there. I think the other one is just going to be assumptions on some of the recoveries that we've got here and the materials that we're showcasing today for prior wildfire recoveries as well. So in line at this point for the appropriate timing on proposed decisions, prior recoveries, and we'll continue to work our way through some of the legacy claims as well. Sure thing, Hi, Greg. Looking basically at this point is just a reminder, this is at this stage already has had two approvals at the CPUC F5 nothing though. And so we're currently in the appeals process through the courts at this stage, currently looking at the earliest Q2 execution timeframe, just in terms of what we're seeing the appeals process kind of work its way through, still intend to execute this year, allowing us to take out that $6 billion in operating company. Thank you, Greg."

            "name": "Patricia Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today. Our performance in 2021 confirms my confidence in our future. One, we've got the right team in place who implemented our lean operating system first, in wildfire and then across the company. Two, we've established our regional service model to deliver for our hometowns. Three, we met our major commitments in the 2021 wildfire mitigation plan by the end of the year, and implemented programs resulting in a significant reduction in wildfire risk. Four our federal probation period has ended. We're a safer company because of the improvements we've made in the past five years. We look forward to continuing to work closely with policymakers, agencies, and regulators to rebuild trust, through relentless focus on execution. We welcome the transparency and accountability that our customers should expect. And five on our financials, we delivered right on our EPS target $1 share the midpoint of our commitment for non-GAAP core earnings on a fully diluted basis. This is $1.08 on our basic share count consistent with reporting a GAAP loss. We met our commitment to you, our investors, not more not less, putting every penny to work for our customers. As you'd expect from us, we'll continue to manage the business efficiently to benefit our customers and provide predictable financial results to you, our investors every year. For 2022, our non-GAAP core EPS guidance is $1.07 to $1.13 up 7% to 13%. With a midpoint growth at 10%. Longer-term, we're focused on delivering a total return of EPS growth plus dividend yield of at least 10% per year, every year. This premium total return is driven by a simple, but affordable model that you can see on Slide 4. We're making substantial necessary investments for our customers to improve the safety, resiliency and reliability of our service, including our aggressive undergrounding plan. To mitigate the customer impact of our higher investment growth. We're planning to reduce our non-fuel O&M expense by at least 2% every year. And we're fortunate to have sales growth that accelerates over the years ahead from electric vehicles, building electrification and more. And of course, we're making smart business decisions focused on optimizing our generation sources, efficient financing, and minimizing the use of diluted equity. Longer-term, we expect the impact to our customers will be at or below inflation. Everything we've accomplished in 2021 reflects our focus on the triple bottom-line, serving people, the planet and California's prosperity underpinned by our relentless pursuit of improving our performance. We'll continue to lead by that triple bottom-line driving our performance in 2022 and beyond. Speaking of performance, to provide transparency and accountability, we'll be providing you with a report card each quarter. This is something you've been asking for and it is shown here on Slide 5. We'll provide you with specific metrics related to our wildfire efforts, our customers, and our financials. Specifically, we'll show the number of reportable ignitions. Our progress on undergrounding, gas distribution main replacements, our non-fuel O&M cost reduction, and several financial metrics. You'll see our progress across the business as we report out each quarter. Our Clear Sky playbook works. And in 2021, we experienced how powerful it can be here at PG&E. One bread and butter example is an inline inspection job that I visited a couple of weeks ago. Using our daily operating reviews and visual management tools, the project team installed 14 miles of inline inspection capability at the ribbon cutting two local mayors and city council members shared with me how satisfied they were with the work and how we showed up for our hometowns. Seamless cross functional execution that is focused on our customers. Thanks to our vast team for making it look easy. And it can be when we have an operating method that delivers consistent and predictable outcomes. Our lean playbook also drove the execution of our wildfire mitigation plan, producing great results. Last summer, we reengineered our distribution lines to shut off power within one tenth of a second when an object strip strikes the line or a fault occurs. We refer to this as enhanced powerline safety settings or EPSS. In 2021 EPSS was enabled on 45% of the lines in our high fire threat service area based on fuel risk and accessibility. To be clear, EPSS is different from our public safety power shutoff program, which is based on proactively turning off lines in dangerous fire weather conditions, primarily high winds combined with low fuel moisture levels. We're planning on expanding our EPSS program in 2022 to up to 100% of our high fire threat distribution miles. As a reminder, these settings are in place to address the risk of an ignition on a non-red Flag Warning day that also has dry conditions. The expansion of the program in 2022 provides a greater level of risk reduction. And we're also implementing enhancements to reduce the impact of EPSS on customers. As you can see on Slide 6, once we implemented our enhanced powerline safety settings, we saw an 80% reduction and ignitions on enabled circuits, which translates to a 40% reduction in ignitions, across all high fire threat districts. And as I said in 2022, we're planning to adjust the program. So all of our high fire threat distribution miles are capable of enhanced powerline safety settings. We've learned a lot from our experience last summer, and we'll use that education to guide how we engineer these settings in 2022. In addition to expanding our EPSS program in 2022, we continue to focus on our most impacted customers in our public safety power shut off or PSPS program. As a reminder, our modeling shows that the protocols we had in place for the 2021 wildfire season would have reduced the number of impacted structures from 2012 to 2020 by 96%. And due to increase sectionalization and more localized weather forecasting, our 2021 protocols reduced customer impact from PSPS by 78% this year. While we've developed an effectively scoped PSPS program, we expect this program to be less visible over time due to our focus on our enhanced vegetation management, our inspections, our repairs, our undergrounding and our micro grid work. On that last point, PG&E brought our first remote micro grid online in 2021. This solution means that an overhead line is removed in a high fire threat area keeping our customers safe. We're pursuing additional microgrid opportunities as part of our comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan in 2022. When removing a line is infeasible, there are even more exciting tools in our toolkit. What we're exploring is the full potential of distributed energy resources and bi-directional charging electric vehicles that will offer resilience options for our customers. We can eliminate the trade-off between being safe and having power. That's the future. And we're making it happen here in California. For the longer-term, we're expanding our system hardening program. Today we're providing the first look at the next five years of our undergrounding plan. Here on Slide 8. It's big and it's bold. We're moving on our commitment to underground 10,000 miles of power lines in our high fire risk areas. Undergrounding is a strong long-term solution for PG&E to reduce wildfire risk in certain parts of our service area. As well outlined in our 2022 wildfire mitigation plan, our goal is to substantially increase our underground miles each year, ramping up from 175 miles in 2022 to 1,200 miles in 2026. Of the nearly 600 miles we plan to complete by the end of 2023. Our 50% over 50% are already scoped construction ready or under construction. We'll file an update to our 2023 general rate case along with our 2022 wildfire mitigation plan on February 25 to reflect this game changing investment. And here's the good news. Undergrounding is a great example of our simple and affordable model in action. We invest in really high value capital infrastructure, and reduce our spend on temporary repairs and annual recurring expenses. Our update later this month will reflect a minimal impact to customers relative to our previous filings. As you can see on Slide 9, our capital plan is larger from 2022 to 2026 than in previous five years. The need for significant investment across the system results from many factors, including continued safety investments in our gas system, property, and building consolidations, technology adoptions to make our work more efficient, ongoing grid hardening and expansions and of course, our undergrounding plan. And as I covered earlier, we will protect our customers from energy bills they cannot afford with a cost discipline that many of you would expect. Before I hand it over to Chris, I'd like to close by reinforcing that we've met our commitments in 2021. We've laid the foundation to continue meeting our commitments in 2022. We've significantly reduced wildfire risk and are making investments that serve our triple bottom-line of people, planet and California's prosperity. Now I'll hand it over to Chris to cover financials and regulatory items. Thanks, Chris. And as we've discussed, a lot has happened here at PG&E in 2021 to create the launching pad for 2022. As most of you know, I like to tell stories. So here we go. I have one more. A couple weeks ago, on one of my field visits, I stopped at our service center in Auburn. I heard a familiar story from one of our co-workers who lives in Placer County with the PG&E distribution line on his property. Due to various work processes that should have been coordinated, he has had Inspectors on his property four times, three crews on his property three times, and wood management crews another three times, that is 10 visits in a little over a year. Now right after I grown in frustration, I clap and I say okay, team that's upside, let's go on this job, we could have reduced our costs by 20% simply by having a better work plan. Similar jobs in 2021 cost PG&E a billion dollars. Just think of how much better we can do and how our customers will benefit as we reduce the waste and therefore the cost in our processes. I feel that momentum and potential every day. That's just one opportunity of many that I've encountered in my time here at PG&E. Opportunities to reduce costs, opportunities to improve our customer relationships, opportunities to deliver as the hometown team. We're excited about what we've accomplished in 2021 and where we're going in 2022 and beyond, we're further mitigating wildfire risk by expanding our enhanced powerline safety setting program and launching our undergrounding initiative. We've got the right operating system in place to deliver industry leading financial growth fueled by the important safety and resiliency driven infrastructure investments funded by our cost savings, our growing load, and good management practices to keep customer bills affordable. This is a new era at PG&E without trade-offs. We can serve customers, and you, our investors without a compromise. Thank you all for your time. And thank you for supporting the great work being done here at PG&E. Operator, please open the line for questions-and-answers. Well, Hi, Steve. Nice to hear your voice. Well, we have already approved filings for our hardening work. And so we're biasing the plans now to include more undergrounding we have 211 or we have 14 miles done to-date already this year, which we're excited about. We continue to make progress. We have -- so as we look forward to future filings, we'll continue to and you'll see in our wildfire mitigation plan, which we file, February 25, what our plan is for the future of undergrounding year-by-year as we've described in the deck today, but that will then be approved in the coming years. We've actually been asked to update the GRC to reflect the inclusion of undergrounding. And I think the part that's most exciting for people is that we can make those additional undergrounding miles when we factored into our total capital plan with minimal impact on our original filing in terms of costs for customers. And so we can both make it safe and keep it affordable. And we're excited about that progress. Thanks, Steve. Good morning, Jonathan. Yes, great question, Jonathan. As you might expect, Jonathan, there's lots of puts and takes in any given year, and this is one. And we would expect to find another way to achieve our financial commitments. And so are -- we're planning conservatively putting into -- putting together plans in the event that the cost of capital proceeding does not go the way that we think it should. We're very optimistic about our filing and things that we've made a compelling argument. But of course, we'll plan accordingly. As I like to say Jonathan we'll ride the roller coaster, so you don't have to. Yes, as you can imagine, we've got a lot of plans in place that we're working to reduce our O&M and reduce our cost structure. We do have our current rate filing as already in flight for the next four years, as we look at what the rate implications of that filing. It's on average, about 4% per year. It tapers down in the latter half of the plan, and we expect to continue to be able to build this muscle to keep our rates affordable. We do think that our rates are affordable, we believe that our -- the value offer to customers is significant. And so it's truly on us to continue to make the business more efficient, find ways of reducing costs, and one of the things I'm excited about here in California is actual load growth. That's a nice phenomenon. And we see what electric vehicles, electrification, as well as customer growth. We've got a lot of opportunities here to continue to grow in California, that's another offset to unit costs for customers going forward. So this is an important muscle for us to develop here at PG&E. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I see lots of opportunity everywhere I go across the system for ways that we can improve the customer experience and reduce the cost to deliver. Good morning. Thank you. Yes, great question. We have a couple things. We have current active undergrounding projects as we speak, and they range in their cost to complete. And we have some that are today in the $2 million a mile range. We have some that are more than that. And so we're working to find the best methods and systems. We don't have a unit cost negotiated yet with a contractor for the full scope of the 10,000 miles. We're working on identifying what is that path forward. But one of the things that's exciting about the RFI that we did conduct a request for information. We got a lot of new technologies that are being deployed across the globe, presented to us here. For example, some boring equipment that's being used in Germany to underground transmission lines. It's pretty exciting stuff which gives us confidence as we ramp up and scale this program with the right equipment, with the right partners, with the right work process. We can dramatically reduce our costs every year on the undergrounding scope and scale. So we have a lot more meat to put on the bones as we move forward. But again, we'll share more specifics on our cost forecasts and the near-term plans with our wildfire mitigation plan, we're filing on the 25th of February. Now we're shooting Constantine to do our goal is to shoot for 2% a year. We're going to work that every year. There's a lot of efforts and underway and a lot of opportunities that we see going forward. So we're going to work that every year. Though your intuition is right underground is a perfect example of that simple and affordable model. It's capital intensive, because it's the right kind of long-term infrastructure that the system needs to be resilient in these conditions here in California, and reduces then the need to rely on annual vegetation management and other annual expenses. So we really have the opportunity here to demonstrate our simple and affordable model through undergrounding. So you're spot on that. Thanks, Constantine. See you soon. Thanks, Julien. Nice to hear your voice. Well, I think our contracting strategy on our undergrounding work is going to obviously be very important. And we'll be working that out in the coming months. We have confidence, Julien, because we're doing it today, we have projects that are coming in at $2 million a mile today. And that's with what I would say, very rudimentary methods, that we haven't deployed the best technology because we don't have the scale to deploy the technology. In fact, I was out on a job. And I was talking to one of our providers of the trenching equipment. And I said to him, hey, is this your best stuff that we're using? He said, Heck, no, I have much better equipment that we could be using. I said, well, why isn't he here? He said, because you don't have scale. You're not running enough miles underground to make it work for me to bring my best equipment and scale up. And I can help reduce the cost and the speed and the time to deliver. So it's pretty interesting. I go back to my old school industrial engineering, Julien and I know that with scale, we can improve the unit cost. So knowing that we can do $2 million a mile on certain jobs today, I know at scale, we can do that with the right equipment, process, partners and work plan. Yes, we've certainly had conversations with staff about our plans and where we're headed, but our formal filing comes on February 25. And that's when we'll get formal feedback from all the key stakeholders. Thanks, Julien. Yes, so as we look at particularly natural gas, that's been a big driver, we're proud of the fact that we've been able to minimize the impact to customers on that when some of the commodity prices are up 90%, we've been able to protect our customers closer to a 10% to 12% impact of the commodity. And that's because we've got good storage resources, we have a really aggressive purchasing strategy so that we prevent those big real time spikes from hitting our customers. Thank you. We sure can. Good morning. Yes, it's a great question. We're continuing to learn and optimize these and both of those very important tools. I do want to remind and thanks for the prompt here Rich, I want to remind everyone listening that the system is safer today, because we know that we can rely on PSPS and EPSS under multitude of conditions. Regardless of weather, regardless of drought, we can protect our customers. Now we know that PSPS is a tool of last resort, and we only use it when the conditions warrant but we do have a model that when we look rearward, and we can see the previous -- our current algorithm against previous conditions, we would have prevented 96% of structures loss between 2012 and 2020. That is a significant safety mitigation. But we're pretty excited about EPSS. And what we learned last year, and the dramatic reduction in admissions on those circuits where we enabled EPSS. So keep in mind EPSS is enabled, even on a dry -- on a non-windy day, on a non-Red Flag Day when we know the conditions are ripe for a fire spread, we can enable those settings and we're in the process of engineering and preparing to have 100% of our high fire threat miles able to utilize the EPSS standard. So that's pretty exciting for us. I think it's an important combination of risk against that really enable us to keep people safe today. Yes, thank you, Rich. Hi, Greg. Thanks, Greg. Hey, Stephen. Well, we will obviously file as part of our wildfire mitigation plan, we are moving forward and enabling the circuits. Some of the challenges we had early last year, when we did what we call our Hotline tag process, which is different than our full EPS engineered, coordinated settings that we're installing now, they had a significant impact on a small handful of customers who had multiple outages that were long, because it would take out a really long stretch of a circuit. And we'd have to patrol it to make sure that it was safe before we re-energized, we've much dramatically improved our ability to address those challenges by coordinating the settings, engineering it so that a much smaller portion of the line is de-energized when it's made contact with something, whether it's a tree or an animal, that would cause a spark, we are de-energizing a 10th of a second, which is incredible. But then much shorter spans of line. So the patrol is much faster, and the restoration is much faster. And so certainly we work with our regulators to make sure they're comfortable with our approach here. And that filing will reflect that. But we're pretty bullish that this is a very, very important transformation of the safety and de-risking of our system on behalf of customers. And that that is something we're pretty excited about. Yes, so when we're talking about load growth, we're talking about wires growth, we do see that distributed solar actually is an important part of the mix here in California, both from a resiliency perspective, as well as that a peak mitigation particularly when combined with storage, which Stephen, you and I have talked about EVs many times. But I'm pretty excited about the bi directional charging capacity of these new electric vehicles that are on the road today. And the combination of that storage with distributed energy. And certainly has an impact you could describe on load, but I think of it much more as a key enabler to the kind of supply that customers want, that's resilient, that can serve a peak demand and reduce the number of flex alerts we have here in California and make our supply more reliable, and at the same time electrification, and those EVs still does grow demand. So net-net, that's where we come out on this 1% to 3% over time of electric load growth, even with those distributed resources. It's a pretty exciting combination of technologies. Thanks, Stephen. Hi, Ryan. Well, as we've mentioned publicly, we've announced that we're going to do 10,000 miles. And so what we have challenged ourselves and what we're forecasting we're going to do is essentially doubling the miles every year. So in 2020, we did 75 miles in 2022, or in 2021, we did 75 miles, in 2022, we are shooting for 175. And then we'll grow that double, double, double each year until we get up to about that 1,200 range, which we think would be a reasonable level. Now I say all that to say, we have to prove that out, we have to do it. We have to actually execute on those plans and we felt like that was the sort of ramp given the feedback we've received or requests for information from global contractors that we could conceivably deliver. But obviously that all have to be approved through our regulatory filings and more to come on that as we work with key stakeholders across the state to make sure that that plan is one that everyone supports. Yes, that'll be coming in the coming months, we've got to first align with stakeholders on the volume we're looking at. And we'll do the bids. And we'll have a pretty comprehensive contracting strategy for how we'll complete that work and with whom will partner and what portions of that we will in-source, what we will outsource et cetera. We're building out that plan as we speak. Thank you, Ryan. Thanks, Mel. Thank you, everyone again, for joining us today. You know, I just want to reiterate that we have really taken very positive steps forward on our wildfire risk. The combination of EPSS and PSPS in the near-term today makes the system safer, hardening the system, reimagining it with undergrounding as our really backbone of our hardening program going forward gives us a lot of confidence going forward on our ability to keep people safe. I think the other thing I really want to leave you with is that our simple but affordable model is the past to both keep people safe and to deliver for investors. So we think there's no trade-off here, we can have the important capital work done offset by cost savings and load growth and other smart management techniques, we will work to deliver for customers every single day and for you delivering predictable outcomes for investors. This is a near era for PG&A and we can't wait to take the right along with you. So thanks so much for tuning in today. Be safe out there."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Fallon, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Fallon: Thanks, Jenny. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in PG&E 's Third Quarter earnings call. Joining us today are Patti Poppe, our Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer. I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations, and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the Company's actual financial results are described in the second page of today's Third Quarter Earnings Call Presentation.  The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures. The presentation can be found online along with other information at investor.pgecorp.com. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30th, 2021. Before I hand it over Patti, I would like to thank all of you who attended Investor Day, either in-person or virtually and we look forward to seeing you again at EEI.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks Matt. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. This quarter, we delivered non-GAAP core earnings of $0.24 per share. We're reaffirming our 2021, non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance of $0.95 to a $1.05. And we no longer expect to issue equity in 2021. We continue to see rate-based growth of 8 1/2% and longer-term earnings per share growth of 10%. Chris will provide more details on the financials in just a bit. As you saw at Investor Day, our experienced team is driven and focused on delivering clean energy safely every day. We have a very sophisticated and continually improving PS algorithm year-over-year. In fact, when we back cast our current models to the previous utility cost fires between 2012 and 2020, we would have prevented 96% of the structure damage had the current model then in place. This year, we also implemented enhanced power lines safety settings to address wildfire risks we face from extreme drought conditions. In fact, since the end of July through mid-October, we saw a 46% decrease in CPUC reportable ignitions and high-fire threat districts. And an 80% reduction and ignitions on enabled circuits. These enhanced safety settings make our system and our customers safer. We're delivering on the 2021 Wildfire Mitigation plan with our lean operating system and deploying it across the entire Company to deliver predictable outcomes for customers and investors. In addition to quarterly operational, financial, and regulatory updates, I'd like to spend some time on the work done and the changes made since 2019 that make our system safer and more resilient. Let's start on Slide 4 with how we've improved our QPS, WPS programs since 2019. In 2019, we had seven events that impacted over 2 million customers. Since then, we've installed approximately 1,300 weather stations, 500 high definition cameras, and over 1,100 analyzing devices to better pinpoint exactly where we need to initiate PSPS. Our 2021 PSPS algorithms are informing -- are informed by more granular weather forecasting. And we're using Technosylva software to incorporate machine learning into our fire spread modeling so we can better predict where the risk is on our system in real time. Our continuous improvement approach applies to addressing safety risks while minimizing disruption to our customers. As you can see on slide 5, our model shows that by back casting our new 2021 PSPS algorithm onto 2012 to 2020, we would have prevented 96% of the structure damage from fires caused by overhead electrical equipment in our service area. As you know, this year, we experienced extreme drought conditions in our service area. Due to these conditions, we saw fires spread on non-red flag warning days. We assessed these risks and identified where we needed to focus. Guided by former CAL fire and local fire authority personnel who now work for PG and E. We implemented additional Wildfire Mitigation in our high-fire threat area. You can see the results of our safety focus on slide six. We've compared the data since we implemented our enhanced power lines safety settings against the most recent 3-year averages. What we've seen is a 46% reduction in CPUC reportable admissions in our high-fire threat districts from the end of July to mid October. On the specific circuits where we first implemented the enhanced power line safety settings, we've seen an 80% decrease in ignitions over the same time period. We're working hard to reduce the customer impact from these new necessary protocols. We've optimized our protective device settings on all circuits that have enhanced power lines safety settings, and we've adjusted our circuit restoration procedures. These enhancements are making out into smaller and faster to restore, while still removing the admission risk. We're communicating transparently our commitment to preventing fires of consequence to communities where enhanced power line safety settings are in place. Let me make it real with one story. On Monday, October 11th, we initiated a PSPS event that affected about 20,000 people. The winds came in as forecasted, and in 33 instances outside of the PSPS zones, in the highest wind areas, our lines automatically de -energized due to the unpredictable disturbances, and potential risk was mitigated. We know our protocols are working. We will continue to work around the clock to make these solutions less disruptive to customers and know that we are keeping them safe while we do that. Our experience since implementing these settings in late July, will serve as an important guide for our 2022 planning. As we continue to keep people safe each day, I want to talk a bit about the risk reduction work we've completed since 2019. Let's start on slide 7, with our enhanced inspections. As you can see, we're on track to complete our enhanced inspections on $0.5 million assets in 2021 in our high-fire threat areas. These inspections are scheduled to be conducted every year on all assets in Tier 3 and every 3 years for all assets in Tier 2. At the bottom of this slide, you'll see a couple of points on our routine inspection program, which gets a lot of attention internally, but really isn't well known outside of PG&E. As you can see in the green box, we conduct vegetation management inspections across our entire system annually and in high-fire threat areas, we patrol those conductors twice a year. In 2021, we plan to complete 1,800 miles of enhanced vegetation management work combined with what we completed in 2019 and 2020 adds up to over 6,000 miles by the end of this year. While we're focused on keeping people safe with inspections and vegetation management, we're also focused on the longer-term hardening of our system. In the last three months, we've made great progress against our multi-year 10,000 mile under grounding program. Our engineering team is scoping out the work, as you'll begin to see in our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. Our goal is to engage the entire community around the imperative of undergrounding, and we are succeeding. We are engaging stakeholders through our undergrounding advisory group with representatives from environmental groups, labor, telecom, consumer advocacy groups, county of Tri -Eds among others. And we're gathering ideas on innovations in engineering, equipment and construction from the world's best through our RFI process. We're continuing to work on system hardening as you can see here, and we'll provide an update on how we're thinking about that work as we further develop our undergrounding program. As a sneak peek, I'll share one projects we completed this year. In September, we completed undergrounding power lines in Santa Rosa, which resulted in 11,000 customers who will no longer be impacted by PSPS. This is one of many projects. This is the right solution for our customers in that area and that's why we did it. Simple solutions based on customer needs. As I mentioned, more to come on our undergrounding plans as we move into early 2022. At PG&E, effective implementation of our Wildfire Mitigation Plan is enabled by our lean operating system, which we're deploying across the entire Company. Every day, we have over 1200 daily operating reviews beginning with our crews closest to the work first thing in the morning and cascading to our executive operating review. These brief 15-minute huddles provide daily visibility on the metrics that matter more, help us identify gaps, and quickly develop plans to support our teams closest to our customers giving us control and predictability of our operations. As you know, this summer, we were challenged by the Dixie Fire and the impact of fire hit on all of our customers. I'll repeat what we said since Investor Day. Our actions around Dixie were those of a reasonable operator and we're confident in the framework created by AB 1054. AB 1054 resulted in a Wildfire fund to provide liquidity for results claims, a maximum liability cap for reimbursement by investor owned utilities, and enhanced prudency standards when determining that reimbursement amount. We're reflecting that view in our financial statements, which show gross charge of $1.15 billion. We've booked an offsetting $1.15 billion receivable that reflects our confidence to recover costs. As I highlighted, PG&E is working hard every day to deliver clean energy safely. We're building on the mitigation programs we started in 2019. We're staying nimble to respond to current conditions, and we are improving our performance enterprise life. For example, our team just last week, responded to an atmospheric river weather event. That included among the highest rainfall totals observed in a 48-hour time frame ranging from 16 inches at Mt. Tam to 5 inches in Downtown Sacramento. The strongest wind gust recorded was 92 miles per hour -- from miles per hour -- in Alameda County with at least a dozen other locations experiencing gust greater than 69 miles per hour. Even in the face of returning service to 632,000 of the 851,000 customers impacted within 12 hours. I am very proud of the safe and rapid response of our team. Now I'll hand it over to Chris to cover financial and regulatory items.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Patti. As Patti referenced earlier, our financial plan remains on truck, and is supported by a regulatory construct. I'll cover the highlights first, then go into more detail. Today we're announcing that we no longer see a need for equity in 2021, for this year, and we anticipate issuing our 2022 guidance on our Q4 earnings call. Additionally, we're seeing progress on recoveries related to prior well by our risk reduction investments to help the Balance Sheet. Let's start with the share count used for Q3 2021, and year-to-date GAAP and non-GAAP core earnings per share were a GAAP loss position for both Q3, 2021, as well as year-to-date 2021, due to our granter trust election this quarter. As a result, we're required to use basic shares outstanding to calculate both GAAP, EPS and non-GAAP core EPS for Q3 and year-to-date. Our full-year guidance, as always assumed, a GAAP positive year and our full-year non-GAAP core EPS of $0.95 to a $1.05 per share reflects our fully diluted share count. So there's no impact there. I'll start with our Q3 results. We continue to be on track for the 2021 non-GAAP operating EPS of $0.95 to $1.05. This is calculated using our fully diluted share count I just mentioned, consistent with our assumption when we initiated guidance. Slide 9 shows the results for the third quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.24. We recorded a GAAP loss of $0.55 including non-core items. This quarter we recorded a $1.3 billion charge, we've previously guided to as a result of our grantor trust election. As you recall, this charges expected to reverse over time, as the fire within and trust sells shares. Moving to slide 10, as Patti mentioned, we took a $1.15 billion charge this quarter for the Dixie fire. We also recorded a 1.15 billion of offsetting receivables. And the receivables reflect our confidence to recover costs based on the facts and information available to us today. And as a reminder, we recognize the receivable if we believe recovery is profitable under the applicable accounting standard. And due to the fact currently available, we're not in probable for recovery of amounts exceeding insurance for the 2019 Kincaid in 2020 dog fires. Therefore, we haven't recorded offsetting receivables for either of those fires. On Slide 11, we show the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $0.24 per share for Q3 2021 versus $0.22 per share for Q3, 2020. EPS increased due to $0.03 of growth and re-based earnings, $0.02 from using basic share count as a result of the GAAP loss I mentioned earlier. And a penny from lower Wildfire Mitigation costs. Partially offset by a penny decrease due to timing of taxes that will net to 0 over the year. We expect a stronger fourth quarter due to timing of regulatory revenue and efficient work execution. Moving to Slide 12, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP core EPS of $0.95 to a $1.5 on the debt side, we expect to complete an initial 80, 10-54 securitization transaction this month for $860 million. Our separate rate-neutral securitization is also good approved by the CPUC and 1, 3 resolve the final legal steps, we anticipate we'll start issuing bonds early next year. Now some updates on regulatory matters, off specifically highlight important filings reflecting both our focus on timely cost recovery for historical spend, and our focus on the planet supporting California's clean energy future. Turning to slide 13. At the end of the third quarter, we've requested cost recovery for approximately 80% of the unrecovered wildfire related costs in our Balance Sheet. And we already have final decisions, settlement agreements, or interim rates for roughly 60%. In September, we filed a settlement agreement for our 2020 Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Event application. Our request is $1.28 billion comprised of prior wildfire expense, including costs that were incurred in 2018. Given some of these costs predated Wildfire Mitigation Plan construct, we feel the settlement of $1.04 billion is a reasonable outcome. Most recently on this front in September, we filed for recovery of $1.4 billion of additional Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Event costs. Most of the costs are incurred last year and under our proposal, most of the revenue would be recovered in 2023 and 2024, you should expect to see similar filings in coming years as we seek timely recovery of any incremental spend in these areas. Next, I will cover a brief update on our cost of capital application. In late August, we filed a cost of capital application for rate increase in cost of capital for California utilities, as seen from higher interest costs and equity issuance costs. At this stage will follow the recent direction by the administrative law judge and file materials that would have been included in the cost of capital adjustment mechanism advice letter by next Monday. The filing will include calculations of the ROE, half the debt, and the resulting overall return on rate base from the operation of the adjustment mechanism. The ALJs order [Indiscernible] admit the relevant information into the cost of capital proceeding, rather than requesting as to file an advice letter. Our focus on the triple bottom line of people, plan it and prosperity is also not flowing down. Just the adoption for under staffed communities, and of course, support California 's greenhouse gas reduction goals [Indiscernible] extension of our fully subscribing successful EV charged network program. We request [Indiscernible] a total revenue requirement, roughly $225 million from 2023 through 2030 to provide the infrastructures to support 16 16,000 new charging ports, which is just scratching the surface to meet the demands of our customers, who today are driving nearly 20% of the electric vehicles in the country. We are proud to serve the largest base of customers owning and purchasing EV s in the U.S. -- clinical need to reduce wildfire risk in the near-term while running the business effectively for the long term. And we've eliminated our 2021 equity needs. We'll continue to -- in the right investment to deliver clean energy safely to our customers. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks Chris. Every day we are more and more excited about the future we're creating here at PG&E. We can see the difference that's being made and the value to be unlocked. We continue to reduce wildfire risk and we're encouraged by the [Indiscernible] calls are the right solutions on high wind days and our enhanced power lines safety settings are necessary and effective in reducing ignitions and the resulting damage given our current drought conditions. We're focusing our work to make our system safer every day. We're adapting based on what we learned so we can best serve our customers and you, Our investors. We'll deliver on the financials and we will continue to implement the necessary processes to run a high performing utility. Jenny, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Your first question is from Jonathan Arnold with Article of Research.\nJonathan Arnold: Morning guys. Thank you for the update.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Jonathan.\nJonathan Arnold: A couple of questions. Chris picking up on your comment on cost of capital, the fact that the ALJ didn't require the [Indiscernible] resolution of the applications or is it a little early to tell and we need to wait for the scoping memo or some other directive on that?\nChris Foster: Sure. Good morning, Jonathan. And again this is a reminder for everyone, that trigger mechanism itself would have implied a 60 basis point reduction, which for us is roughly $0.6 of EPS. In terms of the current state of affairs, we'll be filing this next set information next Monday, but it is true, Jonathan, that our position is that the rates are not adjusted, January 1st, 2022 by the ALJs ruling, and so that's the scoping memo, but we do think that was a good development in terms of how the judge is treating that next step.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just I guess sort of stepping back a little bit and considering the taking in at the equity out of the -- this year and then the securitization you're about to do, what point in the -- in your forward outlook does the utility arrive at a point where it can stop paying a dividend to the parent and then we can start to think about some strategy levering?\nMatt Fallon: Absolutely. We're looking forward to that, Jonathan. Again, our commitment is really two-fold right? First delay on that period in which we would have non-GAAP core earnings exceeding it, a cumulative $6.2 billion dividend and certainly we'll be partnering. And Patti and myself partnering with our board to the reinstatement level and growth rate at that stage.\nJonathan Arnold: Matt [Indiscernible] that restriction is on the common that the parent Company dividend range but does the utility stock dividend to the parent before that or is it also.\nChris Foster: At this stage, you may have seen that we have disclosed this quarter actually in inter-Company loan. So I think at this point, we've got the path to make sure that we're really stable be it mid-year 2023.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Thank you.\nChris Foster: Sure Thing.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?\nPatti Poppe: Morning Steve. Yes we can hear you Steve. Good morning.\nSteve Fleishman: Thanks. Curious on the -- last week we got the proposals from the democrats in their infrastructure bill, the way we want to call it. And wanted proposals, is this minimum effective tax rate. And I know it's early on, I know it's not pass ed, but is there any risk that that could kind of impact the ability to get all your NOL and also the securitization tied to the NOL?\nChris Foster: Sure, Steve. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I think in its highest level it is -- it's definitely a little bit early in terms of our initial read of this, just given a draft was provided, I believe last Thursday, there's really a couple of things going on. First is that the tax NOLs are derived separately are not impacted by book minimum tax and the proposal really is focused on book and wealth. And then second, as you can imagine, just kind of going forward very traditionally, these costs are considered costs that are part of cost of service and are passed through the customers. So it's a bit early to know exactly how this will play out. And certainly the draft again and DC could change again, but at this stage, I don't see an immediate impact coming through from the [Indiscernible] and the minimum tax.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then question just on the 0 equity this year, it does also look like the contribution -- the billion dollar contribution to -- for securitization was moved to next year. Does that mean the equity could have been moved to next year then or not clear yet?\nChris Foster: Not necessarily, Steve. We've consistently articulated that our focus has been on resolving really prior legacy legal issue that has driven some of the equity needs. And as we disclosed today, we made some progress in particular on the Zalk fire. What I would say is, it is true and we've been signaled pretty clearly here that the -- any additional impact there as it relates specifically to the customer credit trusts would be something that would move into 2020 meaning that first billion payment, right? Would be only occurring after we have completed the securitization itself. So don't see a risk there.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. That's great. And then just lastly, on the Dixie Fire cost, I know that was obviously a large fire in terms of the acreage, but the impact in terms of structures seem to be relatively small and so I'm a little surprised that the size of costs relative to the structures. Could you just maybe give us a better sense of What might explain that?\nChris Foster: Sure. Traditionally, what we'll do, Steve, every quarter is we'll consistently update this at this stage. When you look at the totality of structures impacted, what's going on there is you have a mix of a few things. 1. It's the roughly 1400 structures that were damaged or destroyed, 2. There's often good element of commercial area specific affinity, and 3. There are some areas where we have to contemplate the potential for private timber operations, which would have all on top of each other, you get to the point where we get in terms of those private claims recoveries in the charge we disclosed today of $1.15 billion.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. In your ability, the AB 10-54 is what allows you to be able to offset the write-offs, which shows, I guess being prudent.\nPatti Poppe: And Steve, just to add, acting as a reasonable operator. We look at the fact pattern. We've disclosed much of [Indiscernible] questions. A lot of the information we have is now public through his questions. And in fact pattern is very much [Indiscernible] operator. And with the AB 1054 new prudent standard that is presumed that does gives us a [Indiscernible]\nSteve Fleishman: Great thank you so much for all those answers. Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Yeah.\nChris Foster: Cheers, Steve. Thanks for those questions. And again, what we did in terms of the material this morning for everyone, is if you go to slide 10, we give a gentle recovery mechanism there. Certainly, AB 1054 and its key protections are there, but there are a few other -- this morning. Thanks for that question, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin: Good morning. So maybe to follow up on Steve's question there briefly, can you talk to a little bit more of the process just in terms of seeing that affirmed through the [Indiscernible] effectively truing it up with [Indiscernible] the $600 million plus of suppression costs would have even, when do we get that affirmation that the process under the AB 1054 Wildfire Fund \"works\", if you will? And I know it is [Indiscernible] here, but how do you practically see it from here given now that you've established receivable?\nChris Foster: Sure thing. First things first work our way through the claim themselves. It's very early in terms of any kind of claims interface we're having at this stage. And you traditionally had a time period that passes in terms of the first couple of years before the initial statute limitations stage. At that stage, once we've resolved the claims, and as we resolve the claims, we only then would be maybe bringing things forward to the Wildfire Fund Administrator. Really the Wildfire fund to seek potential recovery. Any guide Julien, this could be a few years before we're having that explicit interaction.  And things related to fire suppression costs, other additional acreage impacted in national and state forest land. Those are things we provided in the disclosures certainly today and we'll continue to take a look at and that's just something that every single quarter we consistently [Indiscernible] 1.15, and the recovery sources would be pretty limited in terms of the Wildfire fund impact [Indiscernible] appear you can imagine, it's just that amount over $1 billion, so roughly a 100 [Indiscernible]\nJulien Dumoulin: Right. In deed. Excellent. And then if I can give it to a slightly different subject here, if you don't mind, on the resource adequacy front, certainly we made it through the summer relatively unscathed when are you curious to see where you stand -- where the state stands against whether [Indiscernible] curious on your state of the shares after the summer.\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, great question. It's definitely top of mind. We did see some delays, particularly a battery storage. However, we expect to have over 900 megawatts added to the system by the end of this year. And so that's all that's valuable for next year. In total, our plan is to have 40 megawatts by the end of 2023. And we're working hard to get those [Indiscernible] we can make up for the delays that continue to plague the supply chain. I'll also our path forward that I think the state of California is actually doing a good job of looking statewide at who's responsible for procuring what. We've developed a strong working relationship with CAISO. CAISO had some new leadership there and we're working together to make sure that we have the kind of transparency and visibility into what is required by when.  And so lots of I would say positive momentum and working together as a state to make sure we have adequate [Indiscernible] gets very important and we see the potential of distributed resources and clean energy resources in this unique time -- this unique moment in time, generational opportunity to clean the energy resources as we transition and provide more resource adequacy for the state. So I would say very positive signals moving forward.\nJulien Dumoulin: If you can just quickly [Indiscernible]\nChris Foster: Hi Julien, it's Chris. There's not much more detail we can provide there. They do relate broadly speaking to the Dixie Fire. What I would offer as well is that -- you can imagine, we have an enormous amount of information in the public domain at this stage through -- primarily due to the requests that have come through from Judge Alsup and the federal monitor, so quite a bit of information already out, we've shared certainly what we've seen at this stage and at this point, we'd certainly be compliant with any request from the U.S. Attorney.\nPatti Poppe: At the end of the day, we continue to say that the fact pattern reinforces, that we are reasonable operator, and will continue to cooperate.\nJulien Dumoulin: Thank you for the responses, guys. Best of luck.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Just a high level one, commodity prices have moved a lot. That's just everybody can look every day of the week and yet they come down in the last couple of days a little bit. How are you thinking about the bill? Because you've got a pretty sizable General Rate Case request out there. You've got all the various cost recovery related to Wildfire spins that are starting to flow to the bill, maybe not on the Income statement, but on the cash-flow statement and online customer sales. And then you've got the move in gas and purchase power costs, which have been pretty material lately. How do you think about things that can help offset that to mitigate significant Bill creep for your customer base.\nPatti Poppe: Michael, great question. This is -- obviously, top of mind affordability is always very important to us. And there's lots of things that we can do at PG&E to protect customers from bill increase. But just a couple -- just a couple of facts for you. Our average monthly gas fill is at around $50. So a 10% increase in gas prices would increase the bill about 2%. The commodity portion of the bill is about 25% of the bill. The impact is muted, but more importantly, I would say that because we have pipeline access to many gas production basins and we're able to -- that allows us to get the lowest cost gas as it's available and then we use our gas storage to then be able to protect customers from these unusual upticks in price and protect our customers in that way. So that's an important thing.  And I would also say that as gas fuels electric prices, a 50% increase in electric power prices would have less than a 10% increase on our customers' overall bill, so again, because we have limited exposure to natural gas for our customers' electric usage. So I would say of many jurisdictions, our customers are well-positioned given the commodity prices. But more importantly, I would suggest that we -- also with our lean operating system in place to protect customers' bills, making great investments in band-aid replacements for permanent long-term, higher-value capital replacements that serve customers very well and better than deliver for investors. So that's definitely our game plan and our path forward.\nMichael Lapides: Can you believe since material Millennium cost decreased potential in the Company in the next couple of years, or do you think it's more beyond that?\nPatti Poppe: Well, I think we're seeing cost improvements to bay by Oliver already some of our wells on the visibility that we have with our daily operating review cadence, or experienced executives on a routine annual basis, I suggest those cost savings will materialize and they are materializing now and they won't materialize for years and years and years to come. I will share with you every moment that I spend of there being our operations, which is a lot of moments. I see great opportunities for waste elimination and costs savings for our customers.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Patti. Much appreciated.\nPatti Poppe: You're welcome, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Byrd: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: Morning. I wanted to step back on federal draft legislation again, building on Steve's question. Just thinking about other provisions that I notice, certainly think about sort of that quite a bit of capital [Indiscernible] climate change impacts, what that might be able to do from both PG&E specific [Indiscernible] reducing fibers? And then maybe just second part of the question is just very broad, which is just other impacts from federal legislation that you're thinking about the [Indiscernible] what I've been thinking about a sort of climate [Indiscernible] things?\nPatti Poppe: Steve and we have been actively engaged very early on in the great resilience, the climate adaptation components of much of the infrastructure package and we want to make sure that there were a couple of things that were recognized in each one is making sure that we can have support for our customers on vegetation management, which has a high expense item for us, as well as other grid hardening solutions, micro grids, or even undergrounding, and we see those elements in the package today. Now your guess is as good as mine of what they're actually going to get past, but they continue to be in the revisions that we see coming forward. So we think that's a good sign. We also are very [Indiscernible] Federal forest service.  The U.S. Forest Service has a very important role to play here in California and we're working in partnership with them on fire prevention and fire mitigation efforts, and making sure they have appropriate staffing so that in the event of fires, they're able to adequately respond and so, we're very supportive of additional funding for the U.S. Forest Service. And then ultimately, obviously this clean energy transition. We've been leaders in that PG&E Today, we have an 85% greenhouse gas free generation mix and we're proud of that and we're proud of the leadership position we've shown nationally on that front.  We want to make sure that the infrastructure package continues to reflect early mover versus, if you will, people who have advanced in clean energy early. We want to make sure that the package definitely recognizes that. So we've been working closely with our DC office and EEI and others to make sure that the clean energy components of any of the legislation is favorable.\nStephen Byrd: That's really helpful. Petty, maybe just building on the point about fire risk, cost mitigation, I guess I'm thinking a lot about that magical 8-to-1 ratio of CapEx to O&M and to the extent that O&M cost can be deferred by federal support, could that potentially allow you to accelerate the under grounding effort in a way that does not harm customer bills because of that total support or is it unclear at this point?\nPatti Poppe: I would say there's lots of reasons why our customers will not be harmed economically by our program. First and foremost, even without federal assistance, your point about the trade-off between OpEx to capital is a key enabler to funding that under-grounding program. We know that the ongoing enhanced vegetation management and [Indiscernible] has a large expense to customers. We $1.4 billion a year on vegetation management, being able to trade off some of that for our capital investments in hardening the system, or even -- so for under-grounding for sure but also for micro grids and other hardening solutions, depending on the circumstances.  That trade-off is very good for customers and we think there's a very -- and we'll start to demonstrate some of that in our longer-term financial plans and our Wildfire Mitigation Plan that you will see at the early part of 2022. We don't think that there's an economic trade-off for customers to safety. We think they can both -- we can both have affordable energy and safe resilient energy and that's our path forward.\nStephen Byrd: Understood. But I was thinking as well, but that could get accelerated even further. If you could get federal support that could lower your cost structure but I guess we'll stay tuned to see how the specific shape up for that.\nPatti Poppe: Yeah. No, your intuition is right on that, Stephen, of course it is. There's -- certainly any support from this package will be good for customers and we've got ample capital to deploy that if we can defray some of the costs to federal support, we're off for it. There's definitely lots to be done out here in California.\nStephen Byrd: Very good. Thank you so much.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Stephen.\nOperator: The next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning, guys.\nPatti Poppe: Morning Shar.\nChris Foster: Morning Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Just real quick on the equity. Obviously, you guys removed the for this year, but I'd love to get a little bit of a sense on sort of the moving pieces as you're thinking about financing which seems to be a relatively ambitious CapEx plan rights as you're thinking about under grading, distributed generation micro grids would any of those programs push you to issue equity. I guess the broader question is, what would push you from 0 or do you think sort of Patti with the amount of leverage that you have at your disposal, like on the O&M side, that you can leverage that opportunity versus having to mitigate -- versus having to actually raise future equity.\nChris Foster: Hey Shar, it's Chris. I'll go ahead and take it.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, Chris\nChris Foster: I think -- morning. So I think there's a couple of factors. First we'll be growing into our undergrounding plan a bit. That's the way I would think about it as we start to reduce operating expense and work into that undergrounding plan, it will occur over time, we'll really start to disclose more details there as part of our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan in February. We haven't guided toward 2022 equity needs at this stage specifically, but we would intend to do so again at Q4 and provide more color at that stage. I wouldn't necessarily just often consider, though what I'm getting at here, undergrounding or for that matter [Indiscernible] driving of an immediate equity need, there's going to be something we're really growing into this plan over time.\nShar Pourreza: Just on under grounding. I'm curious, right? And I know you kind of mentioned it, but I'd love to get a little bit more of an early indication on sort of the cost and scaling up that 10,000 mile program, right? I mean, obviously the slides reiterate the plan through 26 with undergrounding remained, quote-on-quote, a potential opportunities bucket. Are there, I guess -- Patti are there any changes to the scope or timing that you're contemplating for such an undertaking from your prior messaging as the CPUC is starting to more actively inquire by your plans. So net-net, I guess, can you do more cheaper and faster?\nPatti Poppe: I would say we are very bullish on that Shire. We have started to have -- we get a global RFI for up construction and engineering firms and we received about 25 responses and we're very elaborate, we're doing face-to-face discussions with 7 of the firms and they're very affirming. It's very exciting, we can't wait to share more details and we will, but I'll just tell you that we feel more convicted than ever that this is an important part of the solution. And I will reiterate that our capital program is very expansive and under-grounding is a portion of it, we do think that it's an important portion of it, but I can tell you, I heard about just one example of a job last week where we're undergrounding as we speak and as we observe the work, we see tremendous opportunity to reduce the cost of doing that work, and when we're at scale.  And so -- and in fact that project was in about the $2.5 million to $2.7 million a mile range. And that's the current active projects that is not what I would describe at scale. We will be at scale and when we are the costs are inherently lower. And so we are very, very bullish. And all of the feedback information and we have to respect the CPUC 's role to affirm that [Indiscernible] we know and what we can see moving forward we're very confident that as people see the numbers and the plan, they'll feel very excited just like we do.\nShar Pourreza: Now that's helpful metric investors would like to see that 10,000 mile target tripled, but thank you for that. And then just last thing, I apologize I had to hop on and off the call but, can you just maybe comment on the recent wildfire safety division resolution ratifying actions from the 21 WMT update, especially as the resolution would require the 22 WMP update to be included in the GRC proceeding including sort of an explanation of the undergrounding plans. Does it complicate the proceeding or is it in line with sort of your GRC strategy? Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Yeah. I guess a couple of things, just to touch on. So the good news is, as you all remember, the Wildfire Mitigation Plan was approved by OEIS. The CPUC ratified that safety certificates, are ratified our plan on April 21st, 2021, and then we'll shortly file for our safety certificate. We do have a required safety meeting on Wednesday, November 10th with the CPUC and OEIS. We look forward to that opportunity to continue to talk about our plans. And so then shortly there after we'll file our 2022 Wildfire safety certificate for OEIS. Now, currently that Wildfire safety certificates that we currently have is in place until the following proceeding happens. So we feel very -- the process is happening as discussed. We think it's a great opportunity to talk more about our under grounding plans in our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan, but we'll file that in February of next year. So no red flags as far as we're concerned, we feel good about how it's progressing.\nShar Pourreza: Fantastic. Thank you guys, see you in a few days appreciating. Appreciate\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: Once again, if you have a question, press star [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from [Indiscernible].\nJeremy: Good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy: Morning. I think [Indiscernible] recent years and just wondering if this might be a faster weather conditions and how much might be evidenced of any mitigation that investments you've been doing so far are really starting to turn the corner?\nPatti Poppe: Well, Jeremy, I appreciate you asking the question because it's a good opportunity for us to reiterate that we believe that our safety measures that we've put in place, the investments that we've made, the vegetation management, fee inspections, and the enhanced power lines safety settings combined PSPS, has made our system safer and our customers are safer and therefore our investors are as well as a result. Certainly, we were not disappointed to have a little early rain and rain is forecast today and later this week and that all makes us feel good.  But as we look at our ignition rate, that is the most compelling statistic in my opinion, and I encourage everyone to look closely at it. In the areas where we implemented our EPS, we've had an 80% reduction in ignitions. I attribute that to that measure. I will also say that given the drought conditions that we experienced this year, historic extreme drought, we have fared extraordinarily well, and again, I -- in managing the vegetation and doing those inspections.\nJeremy: Got it. That makes sense. And maybe just kind of picking up on your point there, given the success of these enhanced safety settings, what percentage of a high risk circuit can you expand these to, and how long might that take?\nPatti Poppe: Well, again, we can be very targeted about this. We know where [Indiscernible] dynamic tool that we can use. This year, we did around 50%. Next year, we could do a 100%, and we -- but it doesn't have to -- it's not like an on-off [Indiscernible] We can be very, very targeted, and we've done some work to really optimize the device settings to shrink the impact. The time to restore now is much closer to what the time to restore what's before we put it in the settings because we've shrunk the impact of each of the disturbances and our patrols have become more [Indiscernible] for our team's response this year has been extraordinary, particularly given the conditions and we know it's an important tool to have in our toolkit.  Long-term, we know the ultimate solution is a hardened system that is designed and built to be resilient to wildfire and that's why our under grounding and all of our other mitigations are a very important path forward. But in the meantime, today, every day, customers on our system are safer because of the measures that we have taken.\nJeremy: Got it. That's helpful. And just one last one if I could here, and understanding that anything other that's top priorities into Wildfire Mitigation Plan filing?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, I think it's really continuing to streamline our vegetation management and our hardening plan. I do think that you'll see more of these remote grid applications. There's a lot of circumstances where we have a long radio running through a forest that we could just eliminate and don't even underground it, just equip those people at the end of that line with the distributed energy resource that is both cleaned and resilient to Wildfire and lower costs. And so we do think there's a variety of solutions that you'll see more of in our Wildfire Mitigation Plan for 2022 and beyond.\nJeremy: Great, that's very\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: Thanks for taking my questions. What portion of the gas [Indiscernible]\nChris Foster: Hi, Ryan it's Chris, you can imagine, we don't disclose at that level of commercial decision-making for us, but I would just offer again to reiterate what Patti mentioned is, when you combine the gas storage, we've got, when you combine the availability from the basins that we have, you combine the hedging to limit volatility. And the fact that we have costs trued up annually, it really is combined a really good solution for customers and clarity for investors.\nRyan Levine: Okay. But just to be clear, the 10% increase in gas and 2% impact on customer bill is on a hedge basis, and that to still confirm that. And then does that assume about 3 [Indiscernible]\nChris Foster: I wouldn't think about that, Ryan, as netting a hedging impact. I would think about that just as a basic rule of thumb.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And [Indiscernible] that's being completed. And how much more [Indiscernible] it's possible this year under the current regulatory construct?\nPatti Poppe: Well, that's what we're excited to share at the beginning of next year, we'll start to show the miles and we're so excited about that's why we're at a very project-by-project basis now and so we can't wait to be able to share with everyone what the ramp-up plans and get the economies of scale with that ramp.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate that. And then there is a mention of seven parties in more face to face conversation, is the intention for one party [Indiscernible] you're able to comment.\nPatti Poppe: We're looking at it could be multiple, it could be one. We're not sure where that's the benefit of having these conversations with these folks will see it defies was a request for information. not a request for proposal, we're really working together to learn what is the best path forward.\nChris Foster: And just that -- I think right for us, it's exciting scale it's natural to have a couple of large providers that you can create good, good competitive tension in there to get the best outcome possible for customers. We're definitely excited about what we're seeing so far. To entrants and we're winning in that list down to some really good potential partners.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: At this time, there are no other questions. Do you have any closing remarks?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, thanks Jenny. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our system is safer every day, and we want you to know that. It's both safer for our customers and for you, our investors. We look forward to sharing more details with you and having more conversations with you at EEI next week. It's right around the corner. Be safe, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's call, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti. As Patti referenced earlier, our financial plan remains on truck, and is supported by a regulatory construct. I'll cover the highlights first, then go into more detail. Today we're announcing that we no longer see a need for equity in 2021, for this year, and we anticipate issuing our 2022 guidance on our Q4 earnings call. Additionally, we're seeing progress on recoveries related to prior well by our risk reduction investments to help the Balance Sheet. Let's start with the share count used for Q3 2021, and year-to-date GAAP and non-GAAP core earnings per share were a GAAP loss position for both Q3, 2021, as well as year-to-date 2021, due to our granter trust election this quarter. As a result, we're required to use basic shares outstanding to calculate both GAAP, EPS and non-GAAP core EPS for Q3 and year-to-date. Our full-year guidance, as always assumed, a GAAP positive year and our full-year non-GAAP core EPS of $0.95 to a $1.05 per share reflects our fully diluted share count. So there's no impact there. I'll start with our Q3 results. We continue to be on track for the 2021 non-GAAP operating EPS of $0.95 to $1.05. This is calculated using our fully diluted share count I just mentioned, consistent with our assumption when we initiated guidance. Slide 9 shows the results for the third quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.24. We recorded a GAAP loss of $0.55 including non-core items. This quarter we recorded a $1.3 billion charge, we've previously guided to as a result of our grantor trust election. As you recall, this charges expected to reverse over time, as the fire within and trust sells shares. Moving to slide 10, as Patti mentioned, we took a $1.15 billion charge this quarter for the Dixie fire. We also recorded a 1.15 billion of offsetting receivables. And the receivables reflect our confidence to recover costs based on the facts and information available to us today. And as a reminder, we recognize the receivable if we believe recovery is profitable under the applicable accounting standard. And due to the fact currently available, we're not in probable for recovery of amounts exceeding insurance for the 2019 Kincaid in 2020 dog fires. Therefore, we haven't recorded offsetting receivables for either of those fires. On Slide 11, we show the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $0.24 per share for Q3 2021 versus $0.22 per share for Q3, 2020. EPS increased due to $0.03 of growth and re-based earnings, $0.02 from using basic share count as a result of the GAAP loss I mentioned earlier. And a penny from lower Wildfire Mitigation costs. Partially offset by a penny decrease due to timing of taxes that will net to 0 over the year. We expect a stronger fourth quarter due to timing of regulatory revenue and efficient work execution. Moving to Slide 12, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP core EPS of $0.95 to a $1.5 on the debt side, we expect to complete an initial 80, 10-54 securitization transaction this month for $860 million. Our separate rate-neutral securitization is also good approved by the CPUC and 1, 3 resolve the final legal steps, we anticipate we'll start issuing bonds early next year. Now some updates on regulatory matters, off specifically highlight important filings reflecting both our focus on timely cost recovery for historical spend, and our focus on the planet supporting California's clean energy future. Turning to slide 13. At the end of the third quarter, we've requested cost recovery for approximately 80% of the unrecovered wildfire related costs in our Balance Sheet. And we already have final decisions, settlement agreements, or interim rates for roughly 60%. In September, we filed a settlement agreement for our 2020 Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Event application. Our request is $1.28 billion comprised of prior wildfire expense, including costs that were incurred in 2018. Given some of these costs predated Wildfire Mitigation Plan construct, we feel the settlement of $1.04 billion is a reasonable outcome. Most recently on this front in September, we filed for recovery of $1.4 billion of additional Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Event costs. Most of the costs are incurred last year and under our proposal, most of the revenue would be recovered in 2023 and 2024, you should expect to see similar filings in coming years as we seek timely recovery of any incremental spend in these areas. Next, I will cover a brief update on our cost of capital application. In late August, we filed a cost of capital application for rate increase in cost of capital for California utilities, as seen from higher interest costs and equity issuance costs. At this stage will follow the recent direction by the administrative law judge and file materials that would have been included in the cost of capital adjustment mechanism advice letter by next Monday. The filing will include calculations of the ROE, half the debt, and the resulting overall return on rate base from the operation of the adjustment mechanism. The ALJs order [Indiscernible] admit the relevant information into the cost of capital proceeding, rather than requesting as to file an advice letter. Our focus on the triple bottom line of people, plan it and prosperity is also not flowing down. Just the adoption for under staffed communities, and of course, support California 's greenhouse gas reduction goals [Indiscernible] extension of our fully subscribing successful EV charged network program. We request [Indiscernible] a total revenue requirement, roughly $225 million from 2023 through 2030 to provide the infrastructures to support 16 16,000 new charging ports, which is just scratching the surface to meet the demands of our customers, who today are driving nearly 20% of the electric vehicles in the country. We are proud to serve the largest base of customers owning and purchasing EV s in the U.S. -- clinical need to reduce wildfire risk in the near-term while running the business effectively for the long term. And we've eliminated our 2021 equity needs. We'll continue to -- in the right investment to deliver clean energy safely to our customers. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti. Sure. Good morning, Jonathan. And again this is a reminder for everyone, that trigger mechanism itself would have implied a 60 basis point reduction, which for us is roughly $0.6 of EPS. In terms of the current state of affairs, we'll be filing this next set information next Monday, but it is true, Jonathan, that our position is that the rates are not adjusted, January 1st, 2022 by the ALJs ruling, and so that's the scoping memo, but we do think that was a good development in terms of how the judge is treating that next step. At this stage, you may have seen that we have disclosed this quarter actually in inter-Company loan. So I think at this point, we've got the path to make sure that we're really stable be it mid-year 2023. Sure Thing. Sure, Steve. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I think in its highest level it is -- it's definitely a little bit early in terms of our initial read of this, just given a draft was provided, I believe last Thursday, there's really a couple of things going on. First is that the tax NOLs are derived separately are not impacted by book minimum tax and the proposal really is focused on book and wealth. And then second, as you can imagine, just kind of going forward very traditionally, these costs are considered costs that are part of cost of service and are passed through the customers. So it's a bit early to know exactly how this will play out. And certainly the draft again and DC could change again, but at this stage, I don't see an immediate impact coming through from the [Indiscernible] and the minimum tax. Not necessarily, Steve. We've consistently articulated that our focus has been on resolving really prior legacy legal issue that has driven some of the equity needs. And as we disclosed today, we made some progress in particular on the Zalk fire. What I would say is, it is true and we've been signaled pretty clearly here that the -- any additional impact there as it relates specifically to the customer credit trusts would be something that would move into 2020 meaning that first billion payment, right? Would be only occurring after we have completed the securitization itself. So don't see a risk there. Sure. Traditionally, what we'll do, Steve, every quarter is we'll consistently update this at this stage. When you look at the totality of structures impacted, what's going on there is you have a mix of a few things. 1. It's the roughly 1400 structures that were damaged or destroyed, 2. There's often good element of commercial area specific affinity, and 3. There are some areas where we have to contemplate the potential for private timber operations, which would have all on top of each other, you get to the point where we get in terms of those private claims recoveries in the charge we disclosed today of $1.15 billion. Cheers, Steve. Thanks for those questions. And again, what we did in terms of the material this morning for everyone, is if you go to slide 10, we give a gentle recovery mechanism there. Certainly, AB 1054 and its key protections are there, but there are a few other -- this morning. Thanks for that question, Steve. Sure thing. First things first work our way through the claim themselves. It's very early in terms of any kind of claims interface we're having at this stage. And you traditionally had a time period that passes in terms of the first couple of years before the initial statute limitations stage. At that stage, once we've resolved the claims, and as we resolve the claims, we only then would be maybe bringing things forward to the Wildfire Fund Administrator. Really the Wildfire fund to seek potential recovery. Any guide Julien, this could be a few years before we're having that explicit interaction.  And things related to fire suppression costs, other additional acreage impacted in national and state forest land. Those are things we provided in the disclosures certainly today and we'll continue to take a look at and that's just something that every single quarter we consistently [Indiscernible] 1.15, and the recovery sources would be pretty limited in terms of the Wildfire fund impact [Indiscernible] appear you can imagine, it's just that amount over $1 billion, so roughly a 100 [Indiscernible] Hi Julien, it's Chris. There's not much more detail we can provide there. They do relate broadly speaking to the Dixie Fire. What I would offer as well is that -- you can imagine, we have an enormous amount of information in the public domain at this stage through -- primarily due to the requests that have come through from Judge Alsup and the federal monitor, so quite a bit of information already out, we've shared certainly what we've seen at this stage and at this point, we'd certainly be compliant with any request from the U.S. Attorney. Morning Shar. Hey Shar, it's Chris. I'll go ahead and take it. I think -- morning. So I think there's a couple of factors. First we'll be growing into our undergrounding plan a bit. That's the way I would think about it as we start to reduce operating expense and work into that undergrounding plan, it will occur over time, we'll really start to disclose more details there as part of our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan in February. We haven't guided toward 2022 equity needs at this stage specifically, but we would intend to do so again at Q4 and provide more color at that stage. I wouldn't necessarily just often consider, though what I'm getting at here, undergrounding or for that matter [Indiscernible] driving of an immediate equity need, there's going to be something we're really growing into this plan over time. Hi, Ryan it's Chris, you can imagine, we don't disclose at that level of commercial decision-making for us, but I would just offer again to reiterate what Patti mentioned is, when you combine the gas storage, we've got, when you combine the availability from the basins that we have, you combine the hedging to limit volatility. And the fact that we have costs trued up annually, it really is combined a really good solution for customers and clarity for investors. I wouldn't think about that, Ryan, as netting a hedging impact. I would think about that just as a basic rule of thumb. And just that -- I think right for us, it's exciting scale it's natural to have a couple of large providers that you can create good, good competitive tension in there to get the best outcome possible for customers. We're definitely excited about what we're seeing so far. To entrants and we're winning in that list down to some really good potential partners."

We continue to see rate-based growth of 8 1/2% and longer-term earnings per share growth of 10%. Chris will provide more details on the financials in just a bit. As you saw at Investor Day, our experienced team is driven and focused on delivering clean energy safely every day. We have a very sophisticated and continually improving PS algorithm year-over-year. In fact, when we back cast our current models to the previous utility cost fires between 2012 and 2020, we would have prevented 96% of the structure damage had the current model then in place. This year, we also implemented enhanced power lines safety settings to address wildfire risks we face from extreme drought conditions. In fact, since the end of July through mid-October, we saw a 46% decrease in CPUC reportable ignitions and high-fire threat districts. And an 80% reduction and ignitions on enabled circuits. These enhanced safety settings make our system and our customers safer. We're delivering on the 2021 Wildfire Mitigation plan with our lean operating system and deploying it across the entire Company to deliver predictable outcomes for customers and investors. In addition to quarterly operational, financial, and regulatory updates, I'd like to spend some time on the work done and the changes made since 2019 that make our system safer and more resilient. Let's start on Slide 4 with how we've improved our QPS, WPS programs since 2019. In 2019, we had seven events that impacted over 2 million customers. Since then, we've installed approximately 1,300 weather stations, 500 high definition cameras, and over 1,100 analyzing devices to better pinpoint exactly where we need to initiate PSPS. Our 2021 PSPS algorithms are informing -- are informed by more granular weather forecasting. And we're using Technosylva software to incorporate machine learning into our fire spread modeling so we can better predict where the risk is on our system in real time. Our continuous improvement approach applies to addressing safety risks while minimizing disruption to our customers. As you can see on slide 5, our model shows that by back casting our new 2021 PSPS algorithm onto 2012 to 2020, we would have prevented 96% of the structure damage from fires caused by overhead electrical equipment in our service area. As you know, this year, we experienced extreme drought conditions in our service area. Due to these conditions, we saw fires spread on non-red flag warning days. We assessed these risks and identified where we needed to focus. Guided by former CAL fire and local fire authority personnel who now work for PG and E. We implemented additional Wildfire Mitigation in our high-fire threat area. You can see the results of our safety focus on slide six. We've compared the data since we implemented our enhanced power lines safety settings against the most recent 3-year averages. What we've seen is a 46% reduction in CPUC reportable admissions in our high-fire threat districts from the end of July to mid October. On the specific circuits where we first implemented the enhanced power line safety settings, we've seen an 80% decrease in ignitions over the same time period. We're working hard to reduce the customer impact from these new necessary protocols. We've optimized our protective device settings on all circuits that have enhanced power lines safety settings, and we've adjusted our circuit restoration procedures. These enhancements are making out into smaller and faster to restore, while still removing the admission risk. We're communicating transparently our commitment to preventing fires of consequence to communities where enhanced power line safety settings are in place. Let me make it real with one story. On Monday, October 11th, we initiated a PSPS event that affected about 20,000 people. The winds came in as forecasted, and in 33 instances outside of the PSPS zones, in the highest wind areas, our lines automatically de -energized due to the unpredictable disturbances, and potential risk was mitigated. We know our protocols are working. We will continue to work around the clock to make these solutions less disruptive to customers and know that we are keeping them safe while we do that. Our experience since implementing these settings in late July, will serve as an important guide for our 2022 planning. As we continue to keep people safe each day, I want to talk a bit about the risk reduction work we've completed since 2019. Let's start on slide 7, with our enhanced inspections. As you can see, we're on track to complete our enhanced inspections on $0.5 million assets in 2021 in our high-fire threat areas. These inspections are scheduled to be conducted every year on all assets in Tier 3 and every 3 years for all assets in Tier 2. At the bottom of this slide, you'll see a couple of points on our routine inspection program, which gets a lot of attention internally, but really isn't well known outside of PG&E. As you can see in the green box, we conduct vegetation management inspections across our entire system annually and in high-fire threat areas, we patrol those conductors twice a year. In 2021, we plan to complete 1,800 miles of enhanced vegetation management work combined with what we completed in 2019 and 2020 adds up to over 6,000 miles by the end of this year. While we're focused on keeping people safe with inspections and vegetation management, we're also focused on the longer-term hardening of our system. In the last three months, we've made great progress against our multi-year 10,000 mile under grounding program. Our engineering team is scoping out the work, as you'll begin to see in our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. Our goal is to engage the entire community around the imperative of undergrounding, and we are succeeding. We are engaging stakeholders through our undergrounding advisory group with representatives from environmental groups, labor, telecom, consumer advocacy groups, county of Tri -Eds among others. And we're gathering ideas on innovations in engineering, equipment and construction from the world's best through our RFI process. We're continuing to work on system hardening as you can see here, and we'll provide an update on how we're thinking about that work as we further develop our undergrounding program. As a sneak peek, I'll share one projects we completed this year. In September, we completed undergrounding power lines in Santa Rosa, which resulted in 11,000 customers who will no longer be impacted by PSPS. This is one of many projects. This is the right solution for our customers in that area and that's why we did it. Simple solutions based on customer needs. As I mentioned, more to come on our undergrounding plans as we move into early 2022. At PG&E, effective implementation of our Wildfire Mitigation Plan is enabled by our lean operating system, which we're deploying across the entire Company. Every day, we have over 1200 daily operating reviews beginning with our crews closest to the work first thing in the morning and cascading to our executive operating review. These brief 15-minute huddles provide daily visibility on the metrics that matter more, help us identify gaps, and quickly develop plans to support our teams closest to our customers giving us control and predictability of our operations. As you know, this summer, we were challenged by the Dixie Fire and the impact of fire hit on all of our customers. I'll repeat what we said since Investor Day. Our actions around Dixie were those of a reasonable operator and we're confident in the framework created by AB 1054. AB 1054 resulted in a Wildfire fund to provide liquidity for results claims, a maximum liability cap for reimbursement by investor owned utilities, and enhanced prudency standards when determining that reimbursement amount. We're reflecting that view in our financial statements, which show gross charge of $1.15 billion. We've booked an offsetting $1.15 billion receivable that reflects our confidence to recover costs. As I highlighted, PG&E is working hard every day to deliver clean energy safely. We're building on the mitigation programs we started in 2019. We're staying nimble to respond to current conditions, and we are improving our performance enterprise life. For example, our team just last week, responded to an atmospheric river weather event. That included among the highest rainfall totals observed in a 48-hour time frame ranging from 16 inches at Mt. Tam to 5 inches in Downtown Sacramento. The strongest wind gust recorded was 92 miles per hour -- from miles per hour -- in Alameda County with at least a dozen other locations experiencing gust greater than 69 miles per hour. Even in the face of returning service to 632,000 of the 851,000 customers impacted within 12 hours. I am very proud of the safe and rapid response of our team. Now I'll hand it over to Chris to cover financial and regulatory items. Thanks Chris. Every day we are more and more excited about the future we're creating here at PG&E. We can see the difference that's being made and the value to be unlocked. We continue to reduce wildfire risk and we're encouraged by the [Indiscernible] calls are the right solutions on high wind days and our enhanced power lines safety settings are necessary and effective in reducing ignitions and the resulting damage given our current drought conditions. We're focusing our work to make our system safer every day. We're adapting based on what we learned so we can best serve our customers and you, Our investors. We'll deliver on the financials and we will continue to implement the necessary processes to run a high performing utility. Jenny, please open the line for Q&A. Good morning, Jonathan. Morning Steve. Yes we can hear you Steve. Good morning. And Steve, just to add, acting as a reasonable operator. We look at the fact pattern. We've disclosed much of [Indiscernible] questions. A lot of the information we have is now public through his questions. And in fact pattern is very much [Indiscernible] operator. And with the AB 1054 new prudent standard that is presumed that does gives us a [Indiscernible] Yeah. Good morning, Julien. Yeah, great question. It's definitely top of mind. We did see some delays, particularly a battery storage. However, we expect to have over 900 megawatts added to the system by the end of this year. And so that's all that's valuable for next year. In total, our plan is to have 40 megawatts by the end of 2023. And we're working hard to get those [Indiscernible] we can make up for the delays that continue to plague the supply chain. I'll also our path forward that I think the state of California is actually doing a good job of looking statewide at who's responsible for procuring what. We've developed a strong working relationship with CAISO. CAISO had some new leadership there and we're working together to make sure that we have the kind of transparency and visibility into what is required by when.  And so lots of I would say positive momentum and working together as a state to make sure we have adequate [Indiscernible] gets very important and we see the potential of distributed resources and clean energy resources in this unique time -- this unique moment in time, generational opportunity to clean the energy resources as we transition and provide more resource adequacy for the state. So I would say very positive signals moving forward. At the end of the day, we continue to say that the fact pattern reinforces, that we are reasonable operator, and will continue to cooperate. Thanks, Julien. Michael, great question. This is -- obviously, top of mind affordability is always very important to us. And there's lots of things that we can do at PG&E to protect customers from bill increase. But just a couple -- just a couple of facts for you. Our average monthly gas fill is at around $50. So a 10% increase in gas prices would increase the bill about 2%. The commodity portion of the bill is about 25% of the bill. The impact is muted, but more importantly, I would say that because we have pipeline access to many gas production basins and we're able to -- that allows us to get the lowest cost gas as it's available and then we use our gas storage to then be able to protect customers from these unusual upticks in price and protect our customers in that way. So that's an important thing.  And I would also say that as gas fuels electric prices, a 50% increase in electric power prices would have less than a 10% increase on our customers' overall bill, so again, because we have limited exposure to natural gas for our customers' electric usage. So I would say of many jurisdictions, our customers are well-positioned given the commodity prices. But more importantly, I would suggest that we -- also with our lean operating system in place to protect customers' bills, making great investments in band-aid replacements for permanent long-term, higher-value capital replacements that serve customers very well and better than deliver for investors. So that's definitely our game plan and our path forward. Well, I think we're seeing cost improvements to bay by Oliver already some of our wells on the visibility that we have with our daily operating review cadence, or experienced executives on a routine annual basis, I suggest those cost savings will materialize and they are materializing now and they won't materialize for years and years and years to come. I will share with you every moment that I spend of there being our operations, which is a lot of moments. I see great opportunities for waste elimination and costs savings for our customers. You're welcome, Michael. Good morning Stephen. Steve and we have been actively engaged very early on in the great resilience, the climate adaptation components of much of the infrastructure package and we want to make sure that there were a couple of things that were recognized in each one is making sure that we can have support for our customers on vegetation management, which has a high expense item for us, as well as other grid hardening solutions, micro grids, or even undergrounding, and we see those elements in the package today. Now your guess is as good as mine of what they're actually going to get past, but they continue to be in the revisions that we see coming forward. So we think that's a good sign. We also are very [Indiscernible] Federal forest service.  The U.S. Forest Service has a very important role to play here in California and we're working in partnership with them on fire prevention and fire mitigation efforts, and making sure they have appropriate staffing so that in the event of fires, they're able to adequately respond and so, we're very supportive of additional funding for the U.S. Forest Service. And then ultimately, obviously this clean energy transition. We've been leaders in that PG&E Today, we have an 85% greenhouse gas free generation mix and we're proud of that and we're proud of the leadership position we've shown nationally on that front.  We want to make sure that the infrastructure package continues to reflect early mover versus, if you will, people who have advanced in clean energy early. We want to make sure that the package definitely recognizes that. So we've been working closely with our DC office and EEI and others to make sure that the clean energy components of any of the legislation is favorable. I would say there's lots of reasons why our customers will not be harmed economically by our program. First and foremost, even without federal assistance, your point about the trade-off between OpEx to capital is a key enabler to funding that under-grounding program. We know that the ongoing enhanced vegetation management and [Indiscernible] has a large expense to customers. We $1.4 billion a year on vegetation management, being able to trade off some of that for our capital investments in hardening the system, or even -- so for under-grounding for sure but also for micro grids and other hardening solutions, depending on the circumstances.  That trade-off is very good for customers and we think there's a very -- and we'll start to demonstrate some of that in our longer-term financial plans and our Wildfire Mitigation Plan that you will see at the early part of 2022. We don't think that there's an economic trade-off for customers to safety. We think they can both -- we can both have affordable energy and safe resilient energy and that's our path forward. Yeah. No, your intuition is right on that, Stephen, of course it is. There's -- certainly any support from this package will be good for customers and we've got ample capital to deploy that if we can defray some of the costs to federal support, we're off for it. There's definitely lots to be done out here in California. Thanks, Stephen. Morning Shar. I would say we are very bullish on that Shire. We have started to have -- we get a global RFI for up construction and engineering firms and we received about 25 responses and we're very elaborate, we're doing face-to-face discussions with 7 of the firms and they're very affirming. It's very exciting, we can't wait to share more details and we will, but I'll just tell you that we feel more convicted than ever that this is an important part of the solution. And I will reiterate that our capital program is very expansive and under-grounding is a portion of it, we do think that it's an important portion of it, but I can tell you, I heard about just one example of a job last week where we're undergrounding as we speak and as we observe the work, we see tremendous opportunity to reduce the cost of doing that work, and when we're at scale.  And so -- and in fact that project was in about the $2.5 million to $2.7 million a mile range. And that's the current active projects that is not what I would describe at scale. We will be at scale and when we are the costs are inherently lower. And so we are very, very bullish. And all of the feedback information and we have to respect the CPUC 's role to affirm that [Indiscernible] we know and what we can see moving forward we're very confident that as people see the numbers and the plan, they'll feel very excited just like we do. Yeah. I guess a couple of things, just to touch on. So the good news is, as you all remember, the Wildfire Mitigation Plan was approved by OEIS. The CPUC ratified that safety certificates, are ratified our plan on April 21st, 2021, and then we'll shortly file for our safety certificate. We do have a required safety meeting on Wednesday, November 10th with the CPUC and OEIS. We look forward to that opportunity to continue to talk about our plans. And so then shortly there after we'll file our 2022 Wildfire safety certificate for OEIS. Now, currently that Wildfire safety certificates that we currently have is in place until the following proceeding happens. So we feel very -- the process is happening as discussed. We think it's a great opportunity to talk more about our under grounding plans in our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan, but we'll file that in February of next year. So no red flags as far as we're concerned, we feel good about how it's progressing. Thanks, Shar. Morning, Jeremy. Well, Jeremy, I appreciate you asking the question because it's a good opportunity for us to reiterate that we believe that our safety measures that we've put in place, the investments that we've made, the vegetation management, fee inspections, and the enhanced power lines safety settings combined PSPS, has made our system safer and our customers are safer and therefore our investors are as well as a result. Certainly, we were not disappointed to have a little early rain and rain is forecast today and later this week and that all makes us feel good.  But as we look at our ignition rate, that is the most compelling statistic in my opinion, and I encourage everyone to look closely at it. In the areas where we implemented our EPS, we've had an 80% reduction in ignitions. I attribute that to that measure. I will also say that given the drought conditions that we experienced this year, historic extreme drought, we have fared extraordinarily well, and again, I -- in managing the vegetation and doing those inspections. Well, again, we can be very targeted about this. We know where [Indiscernible] dynamic tool that we can use. This year, we did around 50%. Next year, we could do a 100%, and we -- but it doesn't have to -- it's not like an on-off [Indiscernible] We can be very, very targeted, and we've done some work to really optimize the device settings to shrink the impact. The time to restore now is much closer to what the time to restore what's before we put it in the settings because we've shrunk the impact of each of the disturbances and our patrols have become more [Indiscernible] for our team's response this year has been extraordinary, particularly given the conditions and we know it's an important tool to have in our toolkit.  Long-term, we know the ultimate solution is a hardened system that is designed and built to be resilient to wildfire and that's why our under grounding and all of our other mitigations are a very important path forward. But in the meantime, today, every day, customers on our system are safer because of the measures that we have taken. Yeah, I think it's really continuing to streamline our vegetation management and our hardening plan. I do think that you'll see more of these remote grid applications. There's a lot of circumstances where we have a long radio running through a forest that we could just eliminate and don't even underground it, just equip those people at the end of that line with the distributed energy resource that is both cleaned and resilient to Wildfire and lower costs. And so we do think there's a variety of solutions that you'll see more of in our Wildfire Mitigation Plan for 2022 and beyond. Well, that's what we're excited to share at the beginning of next year, we'll start to show the miles and we're so excited about that's why we're at a very project-by-project basis now and so we can't wait to be able to share with everyone what the ramp-up plans and get the economies of scale with that ramp. We're looking at it could be multiple, it could be one. We're not sure where that's the benefit of having these conversations with these folks will see it defies was a request for information. not a request for proposal, we're really working together to learn what is the best path forward. Thanks, Ryan. Yes, thanks Jenny. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our system is safer every day, and we want you to know that. It's both safer for our customers and for you, our investors. We look forward to sharing more details with you and having more conversations with you at EEI next week. It's right around the corner. Be safe, everybody."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mathew Fallon, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go-ahead sir.\nMathew Fallon: Thank you, Ashley. Good morning everyone. And thank you for participating in PG&E\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Joining us today are Patti Poppe, our Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, which are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's second quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures that can be found online, along with other information at investor.pgecorp.com. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 30, 2021. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks Matt. Hello everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that PG&E delivered non-GAAP core earnings of $0.27 per share in the second quarter. We're reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance of $0.95 to a $1.05. And we're maintaining 2021 equity needs of zero to $400 million. Our rate base grows 8.5% and our earnings growth 10%. Our investments will provide lasting value to our customers, while our new cost reduction efforts will keep our customer bills affordable. All of this is good for customers and investors. Chris will dive into the financials in just a bit. Before I get started, I want to express how much I'm looking forward to seeing many of you in person on August 9, on our Investor Day. You'll get to meet the team we've assembled to lead the transformation of PG&E. We'll take a deeper dive into how we're implementing our PG&E lean operating system across the company with a special focus on our wildfire prevention works, and you'll also get a glimpse into the future opportunities for our company. For today, let's get right to it. I have a feeling I know what's on top-of-mind for you because I know it is for me. The Wildfire season is underway early this year. The Dixie fire started on July 13 and is now 23% contained. My heart goes out to the impacted communities, our customers, and my coworkers who've been affected by this and other fires. I'd like to thank both our crews who are working to make the area safe and CAL FIRE and the U.S. Forest Service for the challenging work that they are doing, in fighting the fires. As of this morning, the Dixie fire has burned 221,000 acres and has impacted about 60 structures. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities, thank goodness. As we've disclosed the morning of July 13, the power went out at our Cresta Dam Powerhouse. When the power plant personnel could not diagnose the problem, a line worker was dispatched to troubleshoot the outage. After substantial effort he arrived on scene and found a tree leaning into our line. The conductor was still attached to the pole and two fuses were open, he noticed a fire at the base of the tree. He called for help and attempted to stop the fire. We've filed a timeline with judge Alsup if he'd like more details. Adam Wright, our Chief Operating Officer, and I went to the fire to ensure that we were providing our full support to our community and our team. We followed the steps of our coworker and were surprised by what was required to access the location of that tree on our line. My co-workers\u2019 efforts there reflects the tenacity and the professionalism of our team here at PG&E who come to work every day with one goal in mind to serve our friends, our families, and our neighbors who also happened to be our customers. Given the conditions this season and what we've learned from other fires, including the Dixie fire, we've taken additional actions to reduce wildfire risk during periods of no to low wind conditions. We've implemented a 911 standard for all faults in high fire threat areas. We're shifting to fast trip settings, our highest risk circuit sections and we're conducting additional safety patrols in certain high-risk areas. When we look at the tree density in our service area and the proximity to our lines, we know we must do something different. On one of my very early field visits. I was on a little dirt road watching us remove many, very large trees within falling distance of our power lines. When I saw that situation, I wondered if we could do something different. When I saw we were spending $1.4 billion of expense on trimming and removing trees annually, I knew we needed a permanent solution and to no longer treat this as an annual maintenance activity. Fortunately, my team knew this too. The team doing our Butte County rebuild showed me on my very first day on the job that they had cracked the code on lower cost, safer and more efficient undergrounding. The dots just had to be connected. A safer, permanent fix with a better expense to capital shift, which makes it safer and more affordable for the people that we serve. Undergrounding minimizes the need for PSPS, undergrounding saves the trees that we all love here in California, undergrounding makes the State of California safer, which is why last week we announced a multi-year safety initiative to underground 10,000 miles of power lines in the highest risk wildfire threat areas. This is not really a new idea or a new concept. Many companies who've dealt with climate resilience issues like hurricanes, for example, have found ways to harden their system with a variety of methods, including undergrounding. We know what can be done at scale here in California at a price our customers can afford. This effort will take some time. And as we've said, we want to take time to hear from a multitude of stakeholders to shape the best plan possible. We'll provide the initial actions on this plan when we file our annual update on our wildfire mitigation plan in February of 2022. But that will just be the start to serving our hometowns facing extreme risk with a safer, better and affordable solution. A critical protection in our system of wildfire prevention efforts is also our Public Safety Power Shutoff program. PSPS is an important backstop to prevent catastrophic wildfire and we will use it when conditions warrant to keep people safe. Our PSPS improved substantially in 2020, and we've made additional improvements for 2021. We continue to get smarter by being data-driven and utilizing technology. Last year, we included factors such as wind, humidity levels and fuels moisture in our modeling. This year, we're adding LiDAR imagery to incorporate trees that could strike overhead power lines. And as we continue to inspect and harden the system, we'll also include maintenance conditions to inform outage parameters. Another enhancement to our public safety program for 2021 is the use of Technosylva\u2019s fire spreads simulation software. This software helps identify given weather conditions where we have fire spread risk real time. We'll be able to show you firsthand how all these technologies come together at Investor Day. Beyond the data and technology improvements, which allow us to pinpoint risk and minimize customers impacted, we're constantly evaluating how to lessen the impact for customers who ultimately do experience PSPS. We start by continuing to shrink the number of customers impacted through our vegetation management and hardening efforts by additional sectionalizing and by providing alternative backup power resources. For example, in May I visited Pollock Pines, a small foot-hill community where approximately 4,500 of our customers have experienced a seven PSPS outages since 2018. Earlier this month, we successfully installed a microgrid in Pollock Pines, which will allow customers there to have access to an energized downtown and critical services, including the fire station, pharmacy, grocery store, and a Red Cross designated shelter at a local church. Downtown Pollock Pines is already served by underground lines, which means it can be safely energized during PSPS with the temporary generation resource that we've enabled. We'll continue to look for opportunities to use micro grids to power through PSPS. It's very important that we implement the key commitments of our Wildfire Mitigation Plan. Through June, this year, we've completed 91% of our vegetation management in the highest risk areas, consistent with our commitments. And we've inspected over 375,000 assets, including 355,000 poles. Since 2018, we've performed nearly 5,000 miles of enhanced vegetation management. We\u2019ve also fully inspected 100% of our lines and vegetation in tier-three high fire threat districts. Two times since 2018 and repaired the critical items found. To monitor this work, our lean wildfire command center in San Ramon, which you\u2019ll see on the ninth helps us identify, escalate and resolve gaps. So we can stay on track with our commitments and our work plan. Our execution of the plan is a critical component in the wildfire certificate process, which has enabled access to AB 1054 funding. We are zeroed in on the fulfillment of our plan. The structures and resources, the state has put into place are also critical improvements. This includes the framework that we have in place through AB 1054, our regulatory construct and legislative support for increased CAL FIRE resources. AB 1054 was created to provide utilities with a funding mechanism for resolved claims in the event of a utility equipment caused wildfire. Under AB 1054, we first submit an annual update to our wildfire mitigation plan outlining the work we\u2019ll do across the system in order to mitigate fire risk. Approval of our plan as a necessary condition to obtain a wildfire safety certificate. Having a safety certificate makes us eligible for the AB 1054 protections, which in effect provides a backstop to pay wildfire claims. These protections include a presumption that our actions are reasonable and provide a cap on our liability. We\u2019ll be applying in the fall to renew the safety certificate. A key condition is approval of our 2021 wildfire mitigation plan, which we expect to receive in the next month or so. The point is this, identify the right work and execute it. I assure you we\u2019re doing just that. I\u2019m asked by many of you, why should someone invest in PG&E under such difficult conditions? I answered by saying few are better equipped and aligned with the state to succeed. We need California and California needs us. We are partnering more than ever to mutually protect and serve our customers and to provide an attractive return to you, our owners and investors who make the necessary investments for our customers possible. I\u2019m asking all our partners to join us. It will take all of us to address climate change on a scale, unlike anywhere else. Together, we can make it right and make it safe again. I\u2019ll hand it over to Chris now to give the financial update for the quarter. Chris?\nChris Foster: Thank you, Patti. As Patti mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve continued to meet our financial and regulatory objectives. I\u2019ll cover the highlights, then go into more detail. We\u2019re on track for our year end EPS guidance landing at $0.27 for the second quarter and $0.50 for the year. We\u2019ve maintained our equity needs guidance of zero to $400 million. And we submitted our 2023 generated case and updated our CapEx and rate-based forecast to reflect this important filing. As I mentioned, we\u2019re on track for the 2021 EPS range we set out of $0.95 to $1.05. Slide 8 shows our results for the second quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.27. We recorded GAAP earnings, including non-core items that are also shown here. We have made further progress on legacy legal claims. As a reminder, we have resolved the claims asserted by the public entities in both the Kincade and Zogg Fires. We\u2019ve continued to try and fairly resolve claims brought by individual claimants related to Zogg Fire and have reached settlement. We also continued discussions with insurance carriers. Progress on these settlements is about making it right for impacted communities. Based on these updates, we increased our accrual for claims related to the Zogg Fire by $75 million to a total of $375 million. This is within our insurance coverage. And so there\u2019s no earnings impacts from this update. Moving to Slide 9. This shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for our non-GAAP core earnings of $0.27 per share for Q2 2021 versus $1.03 per share for Q2 2020 or $0.26 per share after adjusting for the increasing shares outstanding. EPS decreased due to $0.03 of unrecoverable interest expense, $0.01 from the timing of nuclear refueling outages, and $0.01 from the timing of taxes that will net to zero over the year. These decreases were offset by $0.04 of growth and rate base earnings, $0.01 from fewer wildfire mitigation costs above authorized, and $0.01 miscellaneous. Moving to Slide 10. We\u2019ve updated some of our non-core guidance. First investigation remedies has been increased by $20 million to $130 million after tax. This reflects the June Presiding Officer\u2019s Decision related to the 2019 PSPS Order to Show Cause that proposes a penalty of $106 million and will be offset by $86 million in bill credits we\u2019ve already provided to customers. We have appealed this proposal.  Second, our prior period net regulatory items forecast has been changed to a $50 million range. That reflects the outcome of our July GT&S capital settlement. The settlement will result in a $60 million reduction relative to application and also differs recovery over a five-year horizon starting in January of 2022. As a result instead of $200 million of non-core period recoveries in 2021, we now expect record prior period recoveries of $45 million in 2021 and an additional $100 million in 2022 through 2024. Our guidance continues to include a $1.3 billion charge that we expect to take in the third quarter. As a result of the grantor trust selection we made with the agreement reached with a fire victims trust earlier this month. This charge is expected to reverse over time as the fire victim trust fell shares. Increases in the value of our shares would also result in a larger tax deduction ensuing non-core pickups at the time of sale. Continuing with guidance, we are maintaining our equity guidance of zero to $400 million for the year. While we continue work to resolve claims related to the Kincade and Zogg Fire. Our focus remains on minimizing our equity need. Looking over the midterm horizon, you can see here on Slide 11, that we filed our 2023 general rate case in June, which drives significant investments in the coming years. The GRC provides a roadmap through 2026, including key system enhancements and safety improvements, emphasizing customer focus solutions and supporting the triple bottom line. The wildfire mitigation work makes up over $4 billion of investments across our 2023 generated case. We\u2019ve updated our CapEx and rate-based forecast and extended them to 2026 to align with the GRC filing and increased expectations of our capital needs. On average, we plan to spend between roughly $8 billion and $10 billion of CapEx per year over this period. The low end of our range each year was largely unchanged and reflects amounts authorized in the 2020 GRC and the full amount recoverable through balancing account. The high end of the range has increased to reflect an incremental $1 billion of potential capital spend above authorized through 2022 and the capital forecast from the 2023 GRC application for the subsequent years. After incorporating the updated capital forecast with the increased high end, our long-term rate base maintained our roughly 8.5% CAGR. Alongside this growth, we are certainly focused on customer bill impacts. Currently, our customer\u2019s bills reflect less than 3% of their average share of wallet. And on average, this compares to a roughly 3.4% average for the rest of the nation. Recognizing the diversity of our hometowns we serve, we will continue to execute an opportunity for cost savings that benefit our customers such as our recent San Francisco headquarters sale and capital plan enhancements to invest in the system at reduced costs. We\u2019ve had updates on a few other key regulatory matters that I\u2019d like to cover as well. In addition to the AB 1054-related benefits that Patti mentioned, this law also provides a lower cost financing tool in the form of securitization. This benefit will be realized by customers through our lower financing costs. Our AB 1054 securitization application has received a final decision and we anticipate bringing up to $1.2 billion to the market later this year. In June, we were pleased to reach a settlement to recover insurance premium costs recorded to the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account or WEMA. Once approved by the CPUC, this would allow us to recover roughly $450 million of insurance costs for wildfire coverage from 2017 through 2019. As you can see on Slide 14, this is one example of the steps we\u2019re taking to recover remaining $3.5 billion of wildfire related balancing accounts spent. To-date, we have filed for recovery of roughly half of this balance. And you should expect to see us continuing to file for timely recovery as we focus on balance sheet health. Separately, this quarter, we recognized four consecutive quarters of GAAP income with the quarter itself GAAP positive, which means we now have met each of the eight defined metrics required for S&P 500 inclusion. While this marks a milestone for us, as you know, we\u2019re unable to predict the timing of inclusion, including how the charge we plan to take next quarter for the Grantor Trust Election could impact the timing of inclusion. We have executed well against our financial plan for the year and see additional opportunities in the years to come with the undergrounding goal we\u2019ve announced along with a consistent focus on helping California [indiscernible] decarbonization goals. We are investing in key system enhancements and safety improvements that drive our 8.5% rate-based growth. We\u2019ll continue to delever our balance sheet, seek recovery of incremental wildfire related costs and manage our equity needs. These financial results rest on the solid framework provided by our regulatory construct, the underpinnings of AB 1054, and they drive our 10% non-GAAP core earnings per share compound average growth rate. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Chris. We\u2019re doing the right work for wildfire season and we have a good solid framework in place to mitigate risks and strengthen our financial health. We\u2019re taking risks out of the system each and every day. And we\u2019re prepared to use PSPS as a backstop to keep our customers safe. We have a long-term path in front of us that is focused on people, the planet and prosperity. The triple bottom line is reflected in long-term projections and in our daily work. We can\u2019t wait to show you our progress when you come to see us for Investor Day on August 9. We know we must regain your trust and help you believe what I believe California is a great place for your investment dollars and so is PG&E. We look forward to seeing you August 9 at Investor Day. Ashley, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin: Hey, good morning. It\u2019s actually Julien. Thanks for the time and the opportunity to connect.\nPatti Poppe: Hi, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin: Hey, congrats on continued progress here. I wanted to come back to where you started the call perhaps on the efforts to underground. How does that complement some of the earlier efforts on carbon conductors and de-energization efforts? I mean, sort of certainly, there\u2019s sort of a belt and suspenders approach here. Can you talk sort of conceptually how it complements or does this replace in part some of the earlier efforts, if you can, as well as speaking to some of the early reception from stakeholders to the proposal?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, it is a complement, Julien, because we talk about 10,000 miles. Our highest risk miles would be included in that. But we have 25,000 miles of high fire threat district lines. And so this is an \u2013 and it\u2019s a \u2013 in some places it\u2019s an ore for the hardening plans we had before, but we know it\u2019s a better solution in many areas, especially when we can do it at the kind of scale and in conditions that I think in the past, we\u2019re perceived is not possible for undergrounding. And we\u2019re seeing in Butte County, the progress that we can make the advancements in equipment that enable us to dig into even areas of granite, the potential for boring instead of trenching. And so I would consider it and there\u2019s still going to be areas where we do hardening. They\u2019re still going to be areas where vegetation management is an important part. But we think for certain areas, the 10,000 miles that we set out are really important miles that need to be permanently de-risked with undergrounding. And I would say it\u2019s been received extraordinarily well by our communities and by all of our critical stakeholders. There\u2019ve been a lot of people who\u2019ve been asking us to underground, and the fact that we could prove to ourselves by the work that we\u2019ve already done, that it can be done in an affordable way. And as well as I do Julien, and the transition from the OpEx that goes to funding veg management, when we can turn that into the capital to underground that it makes sense for investors to.\nJulien Dumoulin: Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Patti. If I can, a second question perhaps somewhat unrelated, but admittedly, a big a big issue in California, when you think about a resource adequacy and the dynamics last summer, and more critically going into the peak season here this summer. Can you talk about some of the actions you committed to year-over-year as well as some of the prospective actions you\u2019re evaluating now in the very near term, as well as the longer term to help address the more acute flex alerts and things like that.\nPatti Poppe: Yes. You bet. As we look to this summer, and we\u2019ve already had a couple of flex alerts. We have 11,000 megawatts that we planned to have available in August. And our forecasted peak is about 8,500 megawatts. That\u2019s just for PG&E. But as you know, that we are part of the system and obviously part of the California CAISO construct. And so we were able to secure additional storage 700 megawatts of additional storage, including specifically one project that I\u2019m particularly excited about that, I think bodes well for the future is our Moss Landing, utility owned generation, 182 megawatts of storage. It\u2019s one of the largest storage utility owns storage facilities. It is definitely Tesla\u2019s largest project that they\u2019ve done anywhere in the world, and they\u2019ve done it here with us at PG&E. And so I do think long term, however, we\u2019ve got to do a better job here in California of matching supply and demand. And so we\u2019re looking at pursuing additional demand response and leveraging more residential storage, like the Tesla power walls as a virtual power plant. We\u2019ve got a pilot going for this summer to see how much capacity we truly could count on from those residential storage solutions as well. And so when I think about the future, I see all those things coming together, a softened demand peak because of great demand management on the residential and the commercial side, then combined with more distributed resources and storage as the perfect match to our solar duck curve. And so I think we \u2013 and at PG&A in particular have the opportunity to really lead in the deployment of storage as a peak resource solution set.\nJulien Dumoulin: Excellent. Well, thank you for the time. Best of luck to you and your customers this summer.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Julien. Look forward to seeing you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi, can you hear me, okay.\nPatti Poppe: You\u2019re a little quiet.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi. So Patti just, this is obviously the first fire event that\u2019s occurred since you\u2019ve been there at scale. I\u2019m just kind of curious how you\u2019ve dealt with the political community regulatory and any reaction to your take on the relations there and kind of reaction to you?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, a couple of things, Steve. One, I\u2019ll tell you, everyone is focused on one thing, getting the wildfire stop, particularly support for CAL FIRE and the work that they\u2019re doing to contain Dixie Fire. But it\u2019s not the only fire in the state. I think everybody sees that. There\u2019s just so much more work to do. And therefore, that\u2019s why our undergrounding announcement was so well received from the key stakeholders. All of the feedback I received, some of it was, it\u2019s about times, and a lot of it was thank you. And so I do think our commitment to doing whatever it takes and challenging, perhaps old perspectives has been well received.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And just one question on the Dixie Fire respect to damages. In your release, you mentioned, or one of the risks is just the damage to trees. Is there any particular kind of special value of kind of trees in the region where it\u2019s at? Is it a logging area or anything like that, or just any thoughts on that disclosure?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. No, there\u2019s nothing unique or special there. In fact in some ways it\u2019s a blessing that there were so few structures and people who live in the path of the Dixie Fire. So I would just say that no special additional exposure as a result. In fact, it\u2019s probably less exposure given where the fire has traversed up to date.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then just the lesson you mentioned, you\u2019re due for your wildfire mitigation plan approval in the next month, or so. I think, has there been any like recommendations from parties or other things related to that?\nPatti Poppe: Well, we \u2013 sorry, Steve. Go ahead. I\u2019ll go ahead and answer. Yes, we did receive some feedback as did all the IOUs when we originally filed our plans and we were asked for some improvements, but we\u2019ve made those in the wildfire mitigation plan approval is expected here relatively soon. And we were happy to see the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety, OEIS, which will be a new acronym for everyone. OEIS is formerly the wildfire safety division. They did announce this week that they will issue the certificates by their objective is to issue them by December, 2021 for next year. And that we will submit our request for the safety certificate by September 13, 2021. And just to remind everyone, we do have an active certificate that carries us through to January of 2022. So we were really happy to see that they\u2019re working toward a timeline so that we can have more certainty in the process. And so that\u2019s good news.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thanks. Look forward to seeing you soon.\nPatti Poppe: Yes, we do too. Steve, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.\nJonathan Arnold: Hi, good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Hey, Jonathan.\nJonathan Arnold: A quick question, Patti, in your remarks, you mentioned having got 91%, I think of vegetation management in the highest risk areas. Could you just square that with Slide 6 where the percentages are obviously quite a bit lower, but I think they are sort of not just the high-risk areas perhaps. And then is there any chance of that updating, well, how much further along you got in July, because I think those are June numbers, right?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Couple of things. Number one, the 91% reflects of all the vegetation management we've done, what percent is in the high risk areas. If you'll remember our enhanced enforcement was reflective of the desire that our actions match the highest risk reduction areas. And so that the point of the 91% is just to say of the veg management, we've done 91% of it is in the highest risk areas, which meets the intent of enhanced enforcement. On the progress front, as you know the \u2013 I think in the slide, it says 598 miles today. We're moving miles every single day. And so for in our last 48 hour update, we are up to 754 miles of enhanced vegetation management achieved. We're working at about 10 miles per day, and this is one of those measures that's in our wildfire command center that we're tracking every single day. And so the pace of progress, the slope of the curve, if you will, has increased and is at its highest rate to date, because if you'll remember because of the risk mile we had to \u2013front end, we had to really do a lot of replanning at the early part of the year to make sure that that vegetation management we did was in fact in the highest risk areas. So it's two signs of progress. One the 91% of the work that we're doing is in the highest risk areas. That's great news. And number two, we're up to 754 miles which is five miles ahead of our plan, which gets us to 18 miles by year end.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. So you feel good about hitting these targets, regardless of where you might be on them today for those?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, I feel great about hitting those targets and I'm still thankful for my team. They are just on full force and doing a great job.\nJonathan Arnold: Great. And then just one other, if you could, maybe on the undergrounding plan and the \u2013 I think Adam mentioned your briefing last week that you would hope to do sort of 10,000 miles a year. How soon do you think you can get to that sort of level? And secondly can you sort of maybe relate that a little bit to your new rate-based forecast? Is there any, is that sort of some partly in there, or not really at all yet? Or how to think about that?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, one of the things we were very careful not to do in our announcement to our local community about the undergrounding effort is to not put a ceiling on how much we thought we could get done by when. Our objective is to do more faster, Jonathan. And so as Adam talked about a day that we could imagine ourselves beyond a thousand miles a year, when we think about today we're closer to 70 miles in a year. We know that curve to a 1,000, it's going to take some time, but we want it. I think of it like this, Jonathan, I think of it is right now. We're building model T's in Henry Ford\u2019s old factory and we're about to turn on the assembly line. And so that's really what's on our mind. And so we're not capping our forecast and that's why we're not given an end date because we're working that plan with our engineers as we speak the reason for announcing it before the plan was all knotted down is because we wanted to get the input of critical stakeholders. We want to engage with our tribal leaders, with our environmental groups, with our local communities and determine the best place to do that undergrounding first. We know there's high demand for undergrounding. And so this is a great opportunity for us to engage with the people of California to change the risk profile of California and PG&E together. So I would say that when we file our wildfire mitigation plan for next year, we'll be filing that in February-ish first quarter 2022. You'll get to see the first couple years of it, but every year we're going to get better and every year we'll do more. And so we really are hesitant to put a cap on it, or set an end date because we're going to be very dissatisfied until we have fully de-risked the system. But I'll let Chris talk about the reconciliation to the rate case as filed.\nChris Foster: Sure. Thanks Patti. Hey Jonathan. It's \u2013 at this stage, I guess what I would say is we're already seeing unit costs come down, which I think is impressive as we do some of the work here in the field that we're even just early scoping now and I emphasis on early. What you're seeing today in terms of our financial disclosures is that we are directly reflecting the 2023 generate case filing as well as our most recent wildfire mitigation plan filing from earlier this year that did have limited undergrounding envision. So what we're currently contemplating is, as Patti mentioned, looking at that February filing next year, we'll give you really the first look operationally and how that would roll out over the first few years. And we would anticipate Q1 or the first half of next year providing a more fulsome view of the complete financial impact with updated financial.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. That's great. Thank you for the clarity though. If I could squeeze one other thing and what's the latest on where you are with the main securitization docket and re-hearing requests and sort of expected timing to move forward there?\nChris Foster: Sure thing, we had just an update this week. So again, this is for context, this is the $7.5 billion rate neutral securitization that we have filed for to the CPC. [ph] At this stage, Jonathan just had an update that next week on August 5, the CPC has calendar to do their affirmative vote which is an important next step. What that does is that puts us on track for late this year to early next year for executing those securitizations.\nJonathan Arnold: Great. Thank you.\nChris Foster: Thank you. \nPatti Poppe: Thanks Jonathan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. Patti, when I look at what other states and I'll use Florida as an example, has done, when proposing a major undergrounding program. They actually went to the legislature to ensure kind of an annual rigorous \u2013 analytical process for doing a 10 or 20 year forecast, but also to ensure rate making. Do you think you need legislation at all to get approval for this 10,000 mile program? Would you think it's best done in the wildfire mitigation planning process and how do you think about the \u2013 kind of what this, how a cost recovery for that spins occurs? Meaning is this something that gets included in rate base over a long period of time? Or is this something that's outside of rate base?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, well, I'm a big fan of what they did in Florida. There's no doubt that was a smart way to do it. I'm not convinced that we need legislation, nor am I convinced that we need funding outside the utility, but I wouldn't rule it out. As we work with our critical stakeholders, we'll talk about the best way to do this work. The reality much like Florida, where they wanted to harden their system against hurricanes. You can bet people in California are very motivated to rebuild and harden our system against wildfire. And so the most important thing is that we're considered a great resource to attract the capital, that we're the resource that can do the infrastructure at this kind of scale. There's very few entities that could be equipped to take on the risk and the work like PG&E for the State of California. And so we do look forward to partnering with those critical stakeholders in determining the best way to make sure that the work is done safely. And we most quickly de-risk the State of California against all the hazards that a wildfire bring.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then a follow-up on related to that. Just curious, when you're thinking about your 10% EPS growth rate, how are you all thinking about how the cost to capital mechanism could impact the ability to hit that growth rate, especially given the recent move down and kind of treasury \u2013 U.S. treasury yields and corporate bond yields and what that means for kind of 2022 and maybe even longer term.\nChris Foster: Sure thing, Michael it's Chris happy to take it. I think there's a couple of things going on there. First is just the cost of capital adjustment mechanism itself. So seeing where the index is at this stage certainly looks complex to get to that. We'd have to average over 4% at this point to be able to stay out of the dead band. [ph] And so I think at this point it is increasingly likely that it triggers. So I would just say we're evaluating an options in real time on that front. And second, as you can imagine, we're currently looking at Q3 to provide an update there at that stage. We'll have the view on the impact from the trigger itself. And it will be in a situation where we could look forward for 2022 impacts and beyond. But at this stage, our plan internally is to plan conservatively. And ultimately the goal here is as Patti referenced earlier, and I referenced is we're really looking fundamentally at our five-year plan, Michael. Not just 2022, but the five-year plan and saying, let's think about how undergrounding folds in and at what pace, and let's continue to pursue more aggressive cost reductions so that we're both making room for those investments, but also keeping in mind affordability for customers.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And last thing with the high end of the CapEx been raised for the next five years especially in 2023 and beyond, how does that impact your multi-year financing plans?\nChris Foster: Sure, thanks. So, I think at this stage, we haven't been too specific on equity needs outside of the explicit year. And I think what you would find is that we would have a reasonable growth rate there such that we would have limited financing needs. But I don't want to be too specific at this stage again, Michael, because we're actually working the five-year plan as you can imagine to fold in the undergrounding work.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Chris. Thanks Patty.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks Michael.\nChris Foster: Thank you\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning team. It's actually Constantine [ph] here for Shahriar. Thanks for the very comprehensive update to this point.\nPatti Poppe: Hi, Constantine [ph].\nUnidentified Analyst : I just wanted to kind of follow-up on the question on the 2021 Wildfire Mitigation Plan progress, and kind of some of the categories showing kind of below 50% and where, as of, I guess, June, and can you just speak to the various categories and how they get prioritized? And maybe how do you plan to get ahead of the curve on these categories and any kind of risk of regulatory action that you may foresee?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, one thing that's \u2013 I'm so glad you asked this question Constantine [ph], because one thing to clarify is that the percent complete doesn't \u2013 the plan doesn't have a linear line across the year. The plan has a curve to it mainly because of the pre-engineering work and getting the highest risk miles engineered and planned. And so, when we're in our wildfire command center every week, we're looking at that pipeline of work and confirming that we've got the work that'll feed the plan that completes on the finish date, where we're tracking daily targets. And I can tell you I'm feeling very good about our ability to achieve our in-year plan. So, for example, enhanced vegetation management is a good example, the status to date shows 39% complete, but we're five miles ahead of our plan, which gets us home on time by year end. And so that's \u2013 I don't want to confuse by those percent complete year-to-date, it's not a linear curve. So, there are some things though that we definitely want to have completed before August, September. And so, some of those things like asset inspections, for example, we've got almost fully completed. So again, all of these areas, system hardening, veg management, we're not trading off, like we'll not get veg management done. And we'll be willing to accept that we miss another area like hardening. No, no, our plan is to get all of them done. Some of them by year end, some have interim dates before year end. And so, we're on track with the plan and that's the power of this lean operating system. I know I'm a broken record on that, but that's because it makes a big difference. And I can tell you, I can assure you this team, this year has more visibility into our performance than ever before. And we know daily, and I'm getting a weekly, boots on the ground, like eyes on the work update of exactly where we are, which is what gives us a lot of confidence that we can complete the plan by year end.\nUnidentified Analyst : Excellent. I think that clarifies it quite a bit. Just one kind of follow-up on wildfires, your filings disclosed kind of a potential loss for Dixie. And just to understand the process of how, and kind of when the loss gets recorded and the insurance coverage and AB 1054, can you remind us of the insurance levels? And I think it's around $900 for, for this period and with some self-insured and we'll kind of, what's the timeline for AB 1054 protections and funding to get accessed?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, I'll make a couple comments and I'll take it to Chris to cover the insurance and some of the detailed timeline elements. But keep in mind it is early. And there's no way to estimate at this time the value of the damage done on the Dixie fire. Again, I will reiterate that it is a blessing that it's in mostly forested difficult terrain. It's difficult for CAL Fire to access the train, which increases obviously the acres burned, but very limited damage to structure and people for which we're very, very grateful. And we're very grateful for their skill in being able to, in some ways, direct the fire into the less populated areas. But I'll let Chris talk through the timeline when we do know what happens next.\nChris Foster: Sure. Hi, Constantine. It's true. So, the timeline it's traditionally, it's going to take time. I\u2019ll update that. It's ultimately at this stage, certainly even though we have the probable commentary in the queue, it's not estimable at this stage. We need to understand once the fire is contained to be able to understand the total impact. We also need to make sure that we're understanding of the result of the CAL fire investigation and any review that takes place there. So, when you typically look at a timeline and the situation you would have \u2013 it could be anywhere up to a year for a CAL fire investigation. You could then have multiple years that are required to complete review and eventually resolve any outstanding claims themselves. So, you're actually looking at a few years before there's any contemplation of interaction with the AB 1054 wildfire fund. So hopefully that provides a bit more color.\nUnidentified Analyst : It does. And I think if I may have a last question, just turning to something a little bit outside of wildfire than burying tables, the request from the City of San Francisco for PPC, they're going have to do a valuation of the assets that are within the city. Is there kind of a reasonable level that you would actually consider separating the assets? Is it even feasible? And does the CPC have any power in mandating the sale or is it kind of a lead into a potential common nation and municipalization proceeding?\nPatti Poppe: Well, first let me just say that PG&E has served San Franciscans for more than 100 years and we're proud to have that being true. The previous offers made by the city, well undervalued our assets. And so, they are filing just assets the CPC confirmed the value of our assets. And bottom line, we look very much forward to continuing to serve the people of San Francisco.\nUnidentified Analyst : That makes sense. Thanks so much for taking the questions. \nPatti Poppe: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.\nPatti Poppe: Hi, Stephen, good morning.\nStephen Byrd: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions Patti. Lots been covered. I wondered if we could just get your latest thoughts on the state insurance market in California for the virus, sort of everything from your own insurance to the ability of the State Wildfire Fund to get the insurance, I know you are not responsible for that, but just curious, and also sort of availability to insurance, to residents and businesses in California. That's sort of the state of play at the insurance market.\nChris Foster: Sure. Hi, Stephen. Thanks for the question. I think there's really a few different things there, as you can imagine. First is a personal residential, small business coverage as you can imagine, that's been limited at this stage, although the state has stepped in, in multiple areas to make sure that there is coverage provided from companies in situations where homeowners really would have otherwise limited to no options. So, I think that's been a great example of the state evaluating that need for individual customers. As it relates to us and as it relates to the Wildfire Fund Administrator themselves, I think, what we're seeing at this stage is, is typically what we'd done. And we went out this year it really in the spring to really revisit some of our coverage as well on purpose to kind of test the market. At this stage, there still remains depth. The re-insurance market is there as well. And this is after the dramatic acreage that was impacted last year in California. So just to put that in context, that's over four million acres that were impacted. Yet we still saw a depth in the market. Now the pricing is substantial, as you can imagine, but we do have good cost recovery mechanisms here, both in terms of the email accounts that we have. But also going forward, we have contemplated actually a self-insurance construct that we have put forward in our 2023 GRC, because really Steven we're looking at this and these impacts over a number of years as it relates to customers. And this is hundreds of millions of dollars, right, that are really critical for us to be able to take on. But they're expense dollars that go really directly through the customers. So, we're actually interested in examining as self-insurance approach, where we could build this up over time, yet, not have to have that $700 million to $900 million plus impact to customers on an annual basis. So, it's a unique construct, and we think it's one that we put forward to the CPC and are hopeful there is a serious consideration there. Because ultimately for us, we are going to need to continue to procure a sufficient amount of coverage that makes us comfortable in any given year to protect against any substantial risks there for the company.\nStephen Byrd: That really helps. And just going back to the large proposed undergrounding, it makes a lot of sense. I can see the efficiency of doing a large program and the benefit. And I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about sort of the portion of your vegetation management relating to these 10,000 miles over what kind of time periods that could be reduced? Is it fairly linear, meaning as you underground, then your Vegetation Management Program can kind of proportionately declined potentially, or is it just too early to say, how are you all kind of thinking about that?\nPatti Poppe: Well, Steven we are obviously in early days of building out the plan and it will determine exactly which miles we're going to underground. But conceivably, you could imagine a mile for mile swap because we're going to continue to \u2013 we would have in the absence of underground and continue to manage the vegetation near any of our trees or near any of our lines. And so, as we underground, you can imagine that's one last mile to vege manage a mile for mile swap. And so that's really where the benefits are realized for customers. I mean, a $1.4 billion of annual expense in vegetation management is very expensive for our customers today. And so, to have a permanent repair, a permanent fix, a permanent risk elimination to make it safer and not have that ongoing annual maintenance expense really does benefit customers on two fronts, safety, risk, and affordability.\nStephen Byrd: That's great. Maybe just following up on that, how do you \u2013 in terms of the customer bill outlook, it looks like the bill for residence is going up quite a bit over the next few years, and then it slows down. Is there a possibly kind of sculpt this so that there isn't further kind of customer bill pressure in the near term over the next couple of years when bills are going up quite a bit, or how do you \u2013 how might this kind of be feathered into the overall bill?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, it's a little early to say, though we do know just at the highest order, you can see that in the early years of the swap, there's been the swapping of expense for capital. The benefits are realized earlier that can help soften our curve in the near years. And our big opportunity here, and I can tell you with fresh eyes looking at how we do our work, where we do our work, we have so much opportunity to scrub out costs from our system. And we're building that into our plans and we're starting to build the capability. And it's early days, but I can tell you our lean operating system, we all know will help us provide higher value for customers that are lower cost to deliver and we'll look forward to. And it's probably really to just set expectations properly probably early in Q1, 2022, where we'll show you the long-term financial plan and what are the implications then for customers, what are the implications for capital and how does the whole plan come together? And we'll look forward to doing that.\nStephen Byrd: Great. Thank you so much. \nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Steven.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. What was the process and analysis that led to the proposal to underground 10,000 miles line? And how did he arrive as 10,000 as the right number?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there was a series of observations that I had knew on the ground. The undergrounding might be a better solution set, but it was truly working with our team and seeing what we're doing and viewed that really connected the dots. Our cost to achieve has been reduced dramatically. We've got absolute evidence of in the $2 million a mile real time happening as we speak. And we know that's before we even have a full-scale program. So, we knew that the affordability was real. The 10,000 miles matches up to our highest risk miles. As we look at the high fire threat areas, our total lines that are in those areas. And so, we really wanted to make sure that we were both planning for today's risk and any additional risk that might occur as climate conditions become more extreme. And so that's really what drove the aspiration. And that's what's the building block of the plan. But as I've mentioned, we're going to not set a ceiling if you will. That's really just an aspiration that we'll then engineer and rollout a full-scale plan that people can have better visibility. But we want to do that plan with others. This is a significant benefit to the people of California, and we want to make sure we do it in a way that they feel part of the process, that we have an opportunity to build relationships and trust and involvement from our critical stakeholders, how we embark on this really ambitious goal that people have been asking us to do. Everywhere I go, somebody says, can't you just underground it. And so, I'm so proud of this team for being able to see the potential in something that hasn't been done before and say that, in fact, we can do that here at PG&E.\nRyan Levine: Thanks. And the August 5 final vote on securitization, will that be non-appealable, assuming that that becomes a favorable decision for the company?\nChris Foster: Sure, Ryan. Hi. It would actually close out the issue with the CPC. That's the importance of the vote in August 5. There could be judicial review for a limited period of time after that if the intervenor saw to take another step. But again, it puts it's on a good track again, because we continue to aim at end of this year, early next year to execute that securitization.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then the last question, just to clarify, can you confirm that it would have the company issued any shares so far year-to-date, and if the Victim Trust has sold any shares subsequent to the July 7 final agreement on the grant to Victim Trust decision?\nChris Foster: A sure thing. Ryan, no shares from the company and none from the Fire Victim Trust. In fact, the Fire Victim Trust provided an early July update, public update, where they had indicated they have roughly $5.8 billion cash on hand at this stage and have distributed roughly $430 million, which as you can imagine, puts them in a good cash position to make sure that they're resolving claims for victims.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate it. Look forward to seeing you next week.\nChris Foster: Thank you. \nMathew Fallon: Thanks Ryan.\nOperator: At this time there are no further questions. I'll hand the call back for closing remarks.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks Ashley. Thank you everyone for joining us. We really do look forward to seeing you. And I can't wait for you to see what I'm seeing here every day. And that's an extraordinary team under extraordinary circumstances. We'll see you August 9. Thanks so much.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti. As Patti mentioned earlier, we've continued to meet our financial and regulatory objectives. I'll cover the highlights, then go into more detail. We're on track for our year end EPS guidance landing at $0.27 for the second quarter and $0.50 for the year. We've maintained our equity needs guidance of zero to $400 million. And we submitted our 2023 generated case and updated our CapEx and rate-based forecast to reflect this important filing. As I mentioned, we're on track for the 2021 EPS range we set out of $0.95 to $1.05. Slide 8 shows our results for the second quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.27. We recorded GAAP earnings, including non-core items that are also shown here. We have made further progress on legacy legal claims. As a reminder, we have resolved the claims asserted by the public entities in both the Kincade and Zogg Fires. We've continued to try and fairly resolve claims brought by individual claimants related to Zogg Fire and have reached settlement. We also continued discussions with insurance carriers. Progress on these settlements is about making it right for impacted communities. Based on these updates, we increased our accrual for claims related to the Zogg Fire by $75 million to a total of $375 million. This is within our insurance coverage. And so there's no earnings impacts from this update. Moving to Slide 9. This shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for our non-GAAP core earnings of $0.27 per share for Q2 2021 versus $1.03 per share for Q2 2020 or $0.26 per share after adjusting for the increasing shares outstanding. EPS decreased due to $0.03 of unrecoverable interest expense, $0.01 from the timing of nuclear refueling outages, and $0.01 from the timing of taxes that will net to zero over the year. These decreases were offset by $0.04 of growth and rate base earnings, $0.01 from fewer wildfire mitigation costs above authorized, and $0.01 miscellaneous. Moving to Slide 10. We've updated some of our non-core guidance. First investigation remedies has been increased by $20 million to $130 million after tax. This reflects the June Presiding Officer's Decision related to the 2019 PSPS Order to Show Cause that proposes a penalty of $106 million and will be offset by $86 million in bill credits we've already provided to customers. We have appealed this proposal.  Second, our prior period net regulatory items forecast has been changed to a $50 million range. That reflects the outcome of our July GT&S capital settlement. The settlement will result in a $60 million reduction relative to application and also differs recovery over a five-year horizon starting in January of 2022. As a result instead of $200 million of non-core period recoveries in 2021, we now expect record prior period recoveries of $45 million in 2021 and an additional $100 million in 2022 through 2024. Our guidance continues to include a $1.3 billion charge that we expect to take in the third quarter. As a result of the grantor trust selection we made with the agreement reached with a fire victims trust earlier this month. This charge is expected to reverse over time as the fire victim trust fell shares. Increases in the value of our shares would also result in a larger tax deduction ensuing non-core pickups at the time of sale. Continuing with guidance, we are maintaining our equity guidance of zero to $400 million for the year. While we continue work to resolve claims related to the Kincade and Zogg Fire. Our focus remains on minimizing our equity need. Looking over the midterm horizon, you can see here on Slide 11, that we filed our 2023 general rate case in June, which drives significant investments in the coming years. The GRC provides a roadmap through 2026, including key system enhancements and safety improvements, emphasizing customer focus solutions and supporting the triple bottom line. The wildfire mitigation work makes up over $4 billion of investments across our 2023 generated case. We've updated our CapEx and rate-based forecast and extended them to 2026 to align with the GRC filing and increased expectations of our capital needs. On average, we plan to spend between roughly $8 billion and $10 billion of CapEx per year over this period. The low end of our range each year was largely unchanged and reflects amounts authorized in the 2020 GRC and the full amount recoverable through balancing account. The high end of the range has increased to reflect an incremental $1 billion of potential capital spend above authorized through 2022 and the capital forecast from the 2023 GRC application for the subsequent years. After incorporating the updated capital forecast with the increased high end, our long-term rate base maintained our roughly 8.5% CAGR. Alongside this growth, we are certainly focused on customer bill impacts. Currently, our customer's bills reflect less than 3% of their average share of wallet. And on average, this compares to a roughly 3.4% average for the rest of the nation. Recognizing the diversity of our hometowns we serve, we will continue to execute an opportunity for cost savings that benefit our customers such as our recent San Francisco headquarters sale and capital plan enhancements to invest in the system at reduced costs. We've had updates on a few other key regulatory matters that I'd like to cover as well. In addition to the AB 1054-related benefits that Patti mentioned, this law also provides a lower cost financing tool in the form of securitization. This benefit will be realized by customers through our lower financing costs. Our AB 1054 securitization application has received a final decision and we anticipate bringing up to $1.2 billion to the market later this year. In June, we were pleased to reach a settlement to recover insurance premium costs recorded to the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account or WEMA. Once approved by the CPUC, this would allow us to recover roughly $450 million of insurance costs for wildfire coverage from 2017 through 2019. As you can see on Slide 14, this is one example of the steps we're taking to recover remaining $3.5 billion of wildfire related balancing accounts spent. To-date, we have filed for recovery of roughly half of this balance. And you should expect to see us continuing to file for timely recovery as we focus on balance sheet health. Separately, this quarter, we recognized four consecutive quarters of GAAP income with the quarter itself GAAP positive, which means we now have met each of the eight defined metrics required for S&P 500 inclusion. While this marks a milestone for us, as you know, we're unable to predict the timing of inclusion, including how the charge we plan to take next quarter for the Grantor Trust Election could impact the timing of inclusion. We have executed well against our financial plan for the year and see additional opportunities in the years to come with the undergrounding goal we've announced along with a consistent focus on helping California [indiscernible] decarbonization goals. We are investing in key system enhancements and safety improvements that drive our 8.5% rate-based growth. We'll continue to delever our balance sheet, seek recovery of incremental wildfire related costs and manage our equity needs. These financial results rest on the solid framework provided by our regulatory construct, the underpinnings of AB 1054, and they drive our 10% non-GAAP core earnings per share compound average growth rate. With that, I'll turn it back over to Patti. Sure. Thanks Patti. Hey Jonathan. It's \u2013 at this stage, I guess what I would say is we're already seeing unit costs come down, which I think is impressive as we do some of the work here in the field that we're even just early scoping now and I emphasis on early. What you're seeing today in terms of our financial disclosures is that we are directly reflecting the 2023 generate case filing as well as our most recent wildfire mitigation plan filing from earlier this year that did have limited undergrounding envision. So what we're currently contemplating is, as Patti mentioned, looking at that February filing next year, we'll give you really the first look operationally and how that would roll out over the first few years. And we would anticipate Q1 or the first half of next year providing a more fulsome view of the complete financial impact with updated financial. Sure thing, we had just an update this week. So again, this is for context, this is the $7.5 billion rate neutral securitization that we have filed for to the CPC. [ph] At this stage, Jonathan just had an update that next week on August 5, the CPC has calendar to do their affirmative vote which is an important next step. What that does is that puts us on track for late this year to early next year for executing those securitizations. Thank you. Sure thing, Michael it's Chris happy to take it. I think there's a couple of things going on there. First is just the cost of capital adjustment mechanism itself. So seeing where the index is at this stage certainly looks complex to get to that. We'd have to average over 4% at this point to be able to stay out of the dead band. [ph] And so I think at this point it is increasingly likely that it triggers. So I would just say we're evaluating an options in real time on that front. And second, as you can imagine, we're currently looking at Q3 to provide an update there at that stage. We'll have the view on the impact from the trigger itself. And it will be in a situation where we could look forward for 2022 impacts and beyond. But at this stage, our plan internally is to plan conservatively. And ultimately the goal here is as Patti referenced earlier, and I referenced is we're really looking fundamentally at our five-year plan, Michael. Not just 2022, but the five-year plan and saying, let's think about how undergrounding folds in and at what pace, and let's continue to pursue more aggressive cost reductions so that we're both making room for those investments, but also keeping in mind affordability for customers. Sure, thanks. So, I think at this stage, we haven't been too specific on equity needs outside of the explicit year. And I think what you would find is that we would have a reasonable growth rate there such that we would have limited financing needs. But I don't want to be too specific at this stage again, Michael, because we're actually working the five-year plan as you can imagine to fold in the undergrounding work. Thank you Sure. Hi, Constantine. It's true. So, the timeline it's traditionally, it's going to take time. I'll update that. It's ultimately at this stage, certainly even though we have the probable commentary in the queue, it's not estimable at this stage. We need to understand once the fire is contained to be able to understand the total impact. We also need to make sure that we're understanding of the result of the CAL fire investigation and any review that takes place there. So, when you typically look at a timeline and the situation you would have \u2013 it could be anywhere up to a year for a CAL fire investigation. You could then have multiple years that are required to complete review and eventually resolve any outstanding claims themselves. So, you're actually looking at a few years before there's any contemplation of interaction with the AB 1054 wildfire fund. So hopefully that provides a bit more color. Sure. Hi, Stephen. Thanks for the question. I think there's really a few different things there, as you can imagine. First is a personal residential, small business coverage as you can imagine, that's been limited at this stage, although the state has stepped in, in multiple areas to make sure that there is coverage provided from companies in situations where homeowners really would have otherwise limited to no options. So, I think that's been a great example of the state evaluating that need for individual customers. As it relates to us and as it relates to the Wildfire Fund Administrator themselves, I think, what we're seeing at this stage is, is typically what we'd done. And we went out this year it really in the spring to really revisit some of our coverage as well on purpose to kind of test the market. At this stage, there still remains depth. The re-insurance market is there as well. And this is after the dramatic acreage that was impacted last year in California. So just to put that in context, that's over four million acres that were impacted. Yet we still saw a depth in the market. Now the pricing is substantial, as you can imagine, but we do have good cost recovery mechanisms here, both in terms of the email accounts that we have. But also going forward, we have contemplated actually a self-insurance construct that we have put forward in our 2023 GRC, because really Steven we're looking at this and these impacts over a number of years as it relates to customers. And this is hundreds of millions of dollars, right, that are really critical for us to be able to take on. But they're expense dollars that go really directly through the customers. So, we're actually interested in examining as self-insurance approach, where we could build this up over time, yet, not have to have that $700 million to $900 million plus impact to customers on an annual basis. So, it's a unique construct, and we think it's one that we put forward to the CPC and are hopeful there is a serious consideration there. Because ultimately for us, we are going to need to continue to procure a sufficient amount of coverage that makes us comfortable in any given year to protect against any substantial risks there for the company. Sure, Ryan. Hi. It would actually close out the issue with the CPC. That's the importance of the vote in August 5. There could be judicial review for a limited period of time after that if the intervenor saw to take another step. But again, it puts it's on a good track again, because we continue to aim at end of this year, early next year to execute that securitization. A sure thing.

            "content": "Thanks Matt. Hello everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that PG&E delivered non-GAAP core earnings of $0.27 per share in the second quarter. We're reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance of $0.95 to a $1.05. And we're maintaining 2021 equity needs of zero to $400 million. Our rate base grows 8.5% and our earnings growth 10%. Our investments will provide lasting value to our customers, while our new cost reduction efforts will keep our customer bills affordable. All of this is good for customers and investors. Chris will dive into the financials in just a bit. Before I get started, I want to express how much I'm looking forward to seeing many of you in person on August 9, on our Investor Day. You'll get to meet the team we've assembled to lead the transformation of PG&E. We'll take a deeper dive into how we're implementing our PG&E lean operating system across the company with a special focus on our wildfire prevention works, and you'll also get a glimpse into the future opportunities for our company. For today, let's get right to it. I have a feeling I know what's on top-of-mind for you because I know it is for me. The Wildfire season is underway early this year. The Dixie fire started on July 13 and is now 23% contained. My heart goes out to the impacted communities, our customers, and my coworkers who've been affected by this and other fires. I'd like to thank both our crews who are working to make the area safe and CAL FIRE and the U.S. Forest Service for the challenging work that they are doing, in fighting the fires. As of this morning, the Dixie fire has burned 221,000 acres and has impacted about 60 structures. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities, thank goodness. As we've disclosed the morning of July 13, the power went out at our Cresta Dam Powerhouse. When the power plant personnel could not diagnose the problem, a line worker was dispatched to troubleshoot the outage. After substantial effort he arrived on scene and found a tree leaning into our line. The conductor was still attached to the pole and two fuses were open, he noticed a fire at the base of the tree. He called for help and attempted to stop the fire. We've filed a timeline with judge Alsup if he'd like more details. Adam Wright, our Chief Operating Officer, and I went to the fire to ensure that we were providing our full support to our community and our team. We followed the steps of our coworker and were surprised by what was required to access the location of that tree on our line. My co-workers' efforts there reflects the tenacity and the professionalism of our team here at PG&E who come to work every day with one goal in mind to serve our friends, our families, and our neighbors who also happened to be our customers. Given the conditions this season and what we've learned from other fires, including the Dixie fire, we've taken additional actions to reduce wildfire risk during periods of no to low wind conditions. We've implemented a 911 standard for all faults in high fire threat areas. We're shifting to fast trip settings, our highest risk circuit sections and we're conducting additional safety patrols in certain high-risk areas. When we look at the tree density in our service area and the proximity to our lines, we know we must do something different. On one of my very early field visits. I was on a little dirt road watching us remove many, very large trees within falling distance of our power lines. When I saw that situation, I wondered if we could do something different. When I saw we were spending $1.4 billion of expense on trimming and removing trees annually, I knew we needed a permanent solution and to no longer treat this as an annual maintenance activity. Fortunately, my team knew this too. The team doing our Butte County rebuild showed me on my very first day on the job that they had cracked the code on lower cost, safer and more efficient undergrounding. The dots just had to be connected. A safer, permanent fix with a better expense to capital shift, which makes it safer and more affordable for the people that we serve. Undergrounding minimizes the need for PSPS, undergrounding saves the trees that we all love here in California, undergrounding makes the State of California safer, which is why last week we announced a multi-year safety initiative to underground 10,000 miles of power lines in the highest risk wildfire threat areas. This is not really a new idea or a new concept. Many companies who've dealt with climate resilience issues like hurricanes, for example, have found ways to harden their system with a variety of methods, including undergrounding. We know what can be done at scale here in California at a price our customers can afford. This effort will take some time. And as we've said, we want to take time to hear from a multitude of stakeholders to shape the best plan possible. We'll provide the initial actions on this plan when we file our annual update on our wildfire mitigation plan in February of 2022. But that will just be the start to serving our hometowns facing extreme risk with a safer, better and affordable solution. A critical protection in our system of wildfire prevention efforts is also our Public Safety Power Shutoff program. PSPS is an important backstop to prevent catastrophic wildfire and we will use it when conditions warrant to keep people safe. Our PSPS improved substantially in 2020, and we've made additional improvements for 2021. We continue to get smarter by being data-driven and utilizing technology. Last year, we included factors such as wind, humidity levels and fuels moisture in our modeling. This year, we're adding LiDAR imagery to incorporate trees that could strike overhead power lines. And as we continue to inspect and harden the system, we'll also include maintenance conditions to inform outage parameters. Another enhancement to our public safety program for 2021 is the use of Technosylva's fire spreads simulation software. This software helps identify given weather conditions where we have fire spread risk real time. We'll be able to show you firsthand how all these technologies come together at Investor Day. Beyond the data and technology improvements, which allow us to pinpoint risk and minimize customers impacted, we're constantly evaluating how to lessen the impact for customers who ultimately do experience PSPS. We start by continuing to shrink the number of customers impacted through our vegetation management and hardening efforts by additional sectionalizing and by providing alternative backup power resources. For example, in May I visited Pollock Pines, a small foot-hill community where approximately 4,500 of our customers have experienced a seven PSPS outages since 2018. Earlier this month, we successfully installed a microgrid in Pollock Pines, which will allow customers there to have access to an energized downtown and critical services, including the fire station, pharmacy, grocery store, and a Red Cross designated shelter at a local church. Downtown Pollock Pines is already served by underground lines, which means it can be safely energized during PSPS with the temporary generation resource that we've enabled. We'll continue to look for opportunities to use micro grids to power through PSPS. It's very important that we implement the key commitments of our Wildfire Mitigation Plan. Through June, this year, we've completed 91% of our vegetation management in the highest risk areas, consistent with our commitments. And we've inspected over 375,000 assets, including 355,000 poles. Since 2018, we've performed nearly 5,000 miles of enhanced vegetation management. We've also fully inspected 100% of our lines and vegetation in tier-three high fire threat districts. Two times since 2018 and repaired the critical items found. To monitor this work, our lean wildfire command center in San Ramon, which you'll see on the ninth helps us identify, escalate and resolve gaps. So we can stay on track with our commitments and our work plan. Our execution of the plan is a critical component in the wildfire certificate process, which has enabled access to AB 1054 funding. We are zeroed in on the fulfillment of our plan. The structures and resources, the state has put into place are also critical improvements. This includes the framework that we have in place through AB 1054, our regulatory construct and legislative support for increased CAL FIRE resources. AB 1054 was created to provide utilities with a funding mechanism for resolved claims in the event of a utility equipment caused wildfire. Under AB 1054, we first submit an annual update to our wildfire mitigation plan outlining the work we'll do across the system in order to mitigate fire risk. Approval of our plan as a necessary condition to obtain a wildfire safety certificate. Having a safety certificate makes us eligible for the AB 1054 protections, which in effect provides a backstop to pay wildfire claims. These protections include a presumption that our actions are reasonable and provide a cap on our liability. We'll be applying in the fall to renew the safety certificate. A key condition is approval of our 2021 wildfire mitigation plan, which we expect to receive in the next month or so. The point is this, identify the right work and execute it. I assure you we're doing just that. I'm asked by many of you, why should someone invest in PG&E under such difficult conditions? I answered by saying few are better equipped and aligned with the state to succeed. We need California and California needs us. We are partnering more than ever to mutually protect and serve our customers and to provide an attractive return to you, our owners and investors who make the necessary investments for our customers possible. I'm asking all our partners to join us. It will take all of us to address climate change on a scale, unlike anywhere else. Together, we can make it right and make it safe again. I'll hand it over to Chris now to give the financial update for the quarter. Chris? Thank you, Chris. We're doing the right work for wildfire season and we have a good solid framework in place to mitigate risks and strengthen our financial health. We're taking risks out of the system each and every day. And we're prepared to use PSPS as a backstop to keep our customers safe. We have a long-term path in front of us that is focused on people, the planet and prosperity. The triple bottom line is reflected in long-term projections and in our daily work. We can't wait to show you our progress when you come to see us for Investor Day on August 9. We know we must regain your trust and help you believe what I believe California is a great place for your investment dollars and so is PG&E. We look forward to seeing you August 9 at Investor Day. Ashley, please open the lines for Q&A. Hi, Julien. Yes, it is a complement, Julien, because we talk about 10,000 miles. Our highest risk miles would be included in that. But we have 25,000 miles of high fire threat district lines. And so this is an \u2013 and it's a \u2013 in some places it's an ore for the hardening plans we had before, but we know it's a better solution in many areas, especially when we can do it at the kind of scale and in conditions that I think in the past, we're perceived is not possible for undergrounding. And we're seeing in Butte County, the progress that we can make the advancements in equipment that enable us to dig into even areas of granite, the potential for boring instead of trenching. And so I would consider it and there's still going to be areas where we do hardening. They're still going to be areas where vegetation management is an important part. But we think for certain areas, the 10,000 miles that we set out are really important miles that need to be permanently de-risked with undergrounding. And I would say it's been received extraordinarily well by our communities and by all of our critical stakeholders. There've been a lot of people who've been asking us to underground, and the fact that we could prove to ourselves by the work that we've already done, that it can be done in an affordable way. And as well as I do Julien, and the transition from the OpEx that goes to funding veg management, when we can turn that into the capital to underground that it makes sense for investors to. Yes. You bet. As we look to this summer, and we've already had a couple of flex alerts. We have 11,000 megawatts that we planned to have available in August. And our forecasted peak is about 8,500 megawatts. That's just for PG&E. But as you know, that we are part of the system and obviously part of the California CAISO construct. And so we were able to secure additional storage 700 megawatts of additional storage, including specifically one project that I'm particularly excited about that, I think bodes well for the future is our Moss Landing, utility owned generation, 182 megawatts of storage. It's one of the largest storage utility owns storage facilities. It is definitely Tesla's largest project that they've done anywhere in the world, and they've done it here with us at PG&E. And so I do think long term, however, we've got to do a better job here in California of matching supply and demand. And so we're looking at pursuing additional demand response and leveraging more residential storage, like the Tesla power walls as a virtual power plant. We've got a pilot going for this summer to see how much capacity we truly could count on from those residential storage solutions as well. And so when I think about the future, I see all those things coming together, a softened demand peak because of great demand management on the residential and the commercial side, then combined with more distributed resources and storage as the perfect match to our solar duck curve. And so I think we \u2013 and at PG&A in particular have the opportunity to really lead in the deployment of storage as a peak resource solution set. Thanks, Julien. Look forward to seeing you. Good morning, Steve. You're a little quiet. Yes, a couple of things, Steve. One, I'll tell you, everyone is focused on one thing, getting the wildfire stop, particularly support for CAL FIRE and the work that they're doing to contain Dixie Fire. But it's not the only fire in the state. I think everybody sees that. There's just so much more work to do. And therefore, that's why our undergrounding announcement was so well received from the key stakeholders. All of the feedback I received, some of it was, it's about times, and a lot of it was thank you. And so I do think our commitment to doing whatever it takes and challenging, perhaps old perspectives has been well received. Yes. No, there's nothing unique or special there. In fact in some ways it's a blessing that there were so few structures and people who live in the path of the Dixie Fire. So I would just say that no special additional exposure as a result. In fact, it's probably less exposure given where the fire has traversed up to date. Well, we \u2013 sorry, Steve. Go ahead. I'll go ahead and answer. Yes, we did receive some feedback as did all the IOUs when we originally filed our plans and we were asked for some improvements, but we've made those in the wildfire mitigation plan approval is expected here relatively soon. And we were happy to see the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety, OEIS, which will be a new acronym for everyone. OEIS is formerly the wildfire safety division. They did announce this week that they will issue the certificates by their objective is to issue them by December, 2021 for next year. And that we will submit our request for the safety certificate by September 13, 2021. And just to remind everyone, we do have an active certificate that carries us through to January of 2022. So we were really happy to see that they're working toward a timeline so that we can have more certainty in the process. And so that's good news. Yes, we do too. Steve, thank you. Hey, Jonathan. Yes. Couple of things. Number one, the 91% reflects of all the vegetation management we've done, what percent is in the high risk areas. If you'll remember our enhanced enforcement was reflective of the desire that our actions match the highest risk reduction areas. And so that the point of the 91% is just to say of the veg management, we've done 91% of it is in the highest risk areas, which meets the intent of enhanced enforcement. On the progress front, as you know the \u2013 I think in the slide, it says 598 miles today. We're moving miles every single day. And so for in our last 48 hour update, we are up to 754 miles of enhanced vegetation management achieved. We're working at about 10 miles per day, and this is one of those measures that's in our wildfire command center that we're tracking every single day. And so the pace of progress, the slope of the curve, if you will, has increased and is at its highest rate to date, because if you'll remember because of the risk mile we had to \u2013front end, we had to really do a lot of replanning at the early part of the year to make sure that that vegetation management we did was in fact in the highest risk areas. So it's two signs of progress. One the 91% of the work that we're doing is in the highest risk areas. That's great news. And number two, we're up to 754 miles which is five miles ahead of our plan, which gets us to 18 miles by year end. Yes, I feel great about hitting those targets and I'm still thankful for my team. They are just on full force and doing a great job. Yes, one of the things we were very careful not to do in our announcement to our local community about the undergrounding effort is to not put a ceiling on how much we thought we could get done by when. Our objective is to do more faster, Jonathan. And so as Adam talked about a day that we could imagine ourselves beyond a thousand miles a year, when we think about today we're closer to 70 miles in a year. We know that curve to a 1,000, it's going to take some time, but we want it. I think of it like this, Jonathan, I think of it is right now. We're building model T's in Henry Ford's old factory and we're about to turn on the assembly line. And so that's really what's on our mind. And so we're not capping our forecast and that's why we're not given an end date because we're working that plan with our engineers as we speak the reason for announcing it before the plan was all knotted down is because we wanted to get the input of critical stakeholders. We want to engage with our tribal leaders, with our environmental groups, with our local communities and determine the best place to do that undergrounding first. We know there's high demand for undergrounding. And so this is a great opportunity for us to engage with the people of California to change the risk profile of California and PG&E together. So I would say that when we file our wildfire mitigation plan for next year, we'll be filing that in February-ish first quarter 2022. You'll get to see the first couple years of it, but every year we're going to get better and every year we'll do more. And so we really are hesitant to put a cap on it, or set an end date because we're going to be very dissatisfied until we have fully de-risked the system. But I'll let Chris talk about the reconciliation to the rate case as filed. Thanks Jonathan. Yes, well, I'm a big fan of what they did in Florida. There's no doubt that was a smart way to do it. I'm not convinced that we need legislation, nor am I convinced that we need funding outside the utility, but I wouldn't rule it out. As we work with our critical stakeholders, we'll talk about the best way to do this work. The reality much like Florida, where they wanted to harden their system against hurricanes. You can bet people in California are very motivated to rebuild and harden our system against wildfire. And so the most important thing is that we're considered a great resource to attract the capital, that we're the resource that can do the infrastructure at this kind of scale. There's very few entities that could be equipped to take on the risk and the work like PG&E for the State of California. And so we do look forward to partnering with those critical stakeholders in determining the best way to make sure that the work is done safely. And we most quickly de-risk the State of California against all the hazards that a wildfire bring. Thanks Michael. Hi, Constantine [ph]. Yeah, one thing that's \u2013 I'm so glad you asked this question Constantine [ph], because one thing to clarify is that the percent complete doesn't \u2013 the plan doesn't have a linear line across the year. The plan has a curve to it mainly because of the pre-engineering work and getting the highest risk miles engineered and planned. And so, when we're in our wildfire command center every week, we're looking at that pipeline of work and confirming that we've got the work that'll feed the plan that completes on the finish date, where we're tracking daily targets. And I can tell you I'm feeling very good about our ability to achieve our in-year plan. So, for example, enhanced vegetation management is a good example, the status to date shows 39% complete, but we're five miles ahead of our plan, which gets us home on time by year end. And so that's \u2013 I don't want to confuse by those percent complete year-to-date, it's not a linear curve. So, there are some things though that we definitely want to have completed before August, September. And so, some of those things like asset inspections, for example, we've got almost fully completed. So again, all of these areas, system hardening, veg management, we're not trading off, like we'll not get veg management done. And we'll be willing to accept that we miss another area like hardening. No, no, our plan is to get all of them done. Some of them by year end, some have interim dates before year end. And so, we're on track with the plan and that's the power of this lean operating system. I know I'm a broken record on that, but that's because it makes a big difference. And I can tell you, I can assure you this team, this year has more visibility into our performance than ever before. And we know daily, and I'm getting a weekly, boots on the ground, like eyes on the work update of exactly where we are, which is what gives us a lot of confidence that we can complete the plan by year end. Yes, I'll make a couple comments and I'll take it to Chris to cover the insurance and some of the detailed timeline elements. But keep in mind it is early. And there's no way to estimate at this time the value of the damage done on the Dixie fire. Again, I will reiterate that it is a blessing that it's in mostly forested difficult terrain. It's difficult for CAL Fire to access the train, which increases obviously the acres burned, but very limited damage to structure and people for which we're very, very grateful. And we're very grateful for their skill in being able to, in some ways, direct the fire into the less populated areas. But I'll let Chris talk through the timeline when we do know what happens next. Well, first let me just say that PG&E has served San Franciscans for more than 100 years and we're proud to have that being true. The previous offers made by the city, well undervalued our assets. And so, they are filing just assets the CPC confirmed the value of our assets. And bottom line, we look very much forward to continuing to serve the people of San Francisco. Yes. Thank you. Hi, Stephen, good morning. Well, Steven we are obviously in early days of building out the plan and it will determine exactly which miles we're going to underground. But conceivably, you could imagine a mile for mile swap because we're going to continue to \u2013 we would have in the absence of underground and continue to manage the vegetation near any of our trees or near any of our lines. And so, as we underground, you can imagine that's one last mile to vege manage a mile for mile swap. And so that's really where the benefits are realized for customers. I mean, a $1.4 billion of annual expense in vegetation management is very expensive for our customers today. And so, to have a permanent repair, a permanent fix, a permanent risk elimination to make it safer and not have that ongoing annual maintenance expense really does benefit customers on two fronts, safety, risk, and affordability. Yes, it's a little early to say, though we do know just at the highest order, you can see that in the early years of the swap, there's been the swapping of expense for capital. The benefits are realized earlier that can help soften our curve in the near years. And our big opportunity here, and I can tell you with fresh eyes looking at how we do our work, where we do our work, we have so much opportunity to scrub out costs from our system. And we're building that into our plans and we're starting to build the capability. And it's early days, but I can tell you our lean operating system, we all know will help us provide higher value for customers that are lower cost to deliver and we'll look forward to. And it's probably really to just set expectations properly probably early in Q1, 2022, where we'll show you the long-term financial plan and what are the implications then for customers, what are the implications for capital and how does the whole plan come together? And we'll look forward to doing that. Thanks, Steven. Yes, well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there was a series of observations that I had knew on the ground. The undergrounding might be a better solution set, but it was truly working with our team and seeing what we're doing and viewed that really connected the dots. Our cost to achieve has been reduced dramatically. We've got absolute evidence of in the $2 million a mile real time happening as we speak. And we know that's before we even have a full-scale program. So, we knew that the affordability was real. The 10,000 miles matches up to our highest risk miles. As we look at the high fire threat areas, our total lines that are in those areas. And so, we really wanted to make sure that we were both planning for today's risk and any additional risk that might occur as climate conditions become more extreme. And so that's really what drove the aspiration. And that's what's the building block of the plan. But as I've mentioned, we're going to not set a ceiling if you will. That's really just an aspiration that we'll then engineer and rollout a full-scale plan that people can have better visibility. But we want to do that plan with others. This is a significant benefit to the people of California, and we want to make sure we do it in a way that they feel part of the process, that we have an opportunity to build relationships and trust and involvement from our critical stakeholders, how we embark on this really ambitious goal that people have been asking us to do. Everywhere I go, somebody says, can't you just underground it. And so, I'm so proud of this team for being able to see the potential in something that hasn't been done before and say that, in fact, we can do that here at PG&E. Thanks Ashley. Thank you everyone for joining us. We really do look forward to seeing you. And I can't wait for you to see what I'm seeing here every day. And that's an extraordinary team under extraordinary circumstances. We'll see you August 9. Thanks so much."

I would now like to hand the conference over to Matt Fallon, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Fallon: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in PG&E's first quarter earnings call. Joining us today are Patti Poppe, our Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, which are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's first quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures that can be found online, along with other information at investor.pgecorp.com. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. Before I turn it over to Patti, I'm excited to announce that we'll be hosting you for our Investor Day on August 9 here in California. Please keep an eye out for the invite. With that, I'll turn it over to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everybody. It's so great to be with you for our first quarter earnings call. We delivered solid Q1 non-GAAP core earnings of $0.23 per share in our first quarter. This morning, we're reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance of $0.95 to $1.05. We're also maintaining our longer-term 2021 to 2025 non-GAAP core earnings per share CAGR of 10% that we gave on the Q4 call. We're holding our equity guidance range for 2021 at 0 to $400 million. We're taking a conservative approach as we await a final decision on the securitization order from the CPUC and as we continue to make progress on legacy issues. Rest assured, Chris and I are laser-focused on minimizing our 2021 equity needs. We want you to have confidence in our forecast, and we have several more months this year to make progress on the equity range. Chris will describe the financials a bit more in a few minutes. As I finished up my first 100-day listening tour, we've accelerated our move from listening to action. Our priorities fall into 3 categories: first, to end utility-caused catastrophic wildfires by demanding excellence of ourselves in our wildfire prevention work; second, to create a culture of performance by deploying our lean operating system across the enterprise during 2021; and third, by continuing to lead in the clean energy transition through the latest technologies in battery storage, electric vehicle infrastructure and microgrid solutions. Our near and long-term financial performance is inextricably linked to these 3 focus areas. We can deliver on these objectives and thereby serve our customers and our investors better than ever before. Thankfully, I don't need to do this alone. I've hired key senior leaders, who represent the best in the business. We added some very experienced senior leaders to the PG&E team, who we highlighted on the Q4 call. Since then, we've announced additional new senior leaders to round out our team, including Chris Foster as CFO; Jason Glickman, as EVP of Engineering, Planning and Strategy; Carla Peterman, as EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Wade Smith, as Head of Electric Operations. I'm pleased with the team that we have here at PG&E, and I would stack our operating experience up against anyone. The common thread in all of our leaders is a tenacity to perform and the skills to deliver. Before diving into the substantial changes we're making here at PG&E, there's something I'd like to address right up front. Earlier this month, the Sonoma county district attorney filed criminal charges related to the Kincade Fire against the company. We do not agree with these charges, and we'll defend them in legal proceedings. In the meantime, we'll make it right by working to resolve victim's claims fairly and justly. And each day, we'll continue to make it safe by prioritizing the work that needs to be done to deliver energy to our customers. One organizational enhancement I'd like to highlight is our interim wildfire risk organization announced last month, led by Sumeet Singh. This team has been instrumental in responding to the criticism we faced on our enhanced vegetation work. As a part of our lean operating system implementation, the federal monitor and the governor's operational observer are included in our daily operating reviews associated with wildfire work. You may wonder, won't it lean take years to implement? The answer is no. We've already started our implementation on our most important work and the system will provide benefits immediately as well as for years to come as we grow our capability and our maturity. One simple example happened in the very first week of our daily operating reviews, we were off track on our distribution sectionalizing device installations. We completed 12 devices as compared to a goal of 30. And as a result of the daily operating review, we gained visibility of the problem and built a recovery plan that's been outlined and managed to make sure we get back on track. Look, it may sound very simple, but this is a sort of thing that gets lost without an operating system. Next thing we know, the problem snowballs, we're too late to fix it, another commitment missed. Great operators keep their promises and have a system to manage them. We will be a great operator, thanks to our lean operating system. We have the right team implementing the lean system on this critical work, and there'll be a valuable resource as we implement lean across the enterprise throughout the year. On that point, in early March, I attended a CPUC workshop on a regionalization filing. I was able to share my thoughts on how PG&E could benefit from implementing a lean operating process on a localized level. We'll leverage the benefit of the lean system and the regionalized teams focused on engaging customers and communities and incorporating their input. We've listened and we've seen that we need to improve our local presence and our performance, and we are going to do just that. As we implement the lean operating system, we'll continue to uncover opportunities to improve and take actions to close the gap. In addition to getting our senior leadership team in place, establishing our lean operating system and ensuring a hometown experience, we're able to begin measuring our performance to the Triple Bottom Line of people, planet and California's prosperity. For PG&E and for California, serving our planet means continuing our leadership role delivering clean energy to our customers. In 2020, 88% of our bundled sales were from greenhouse gas-free sources of energy, more than twice the average across U.S. utilities. We're not resting there, and we're working to bring on over 900 megawatts of additional battery storage by this August, assuring that we have both adequate supply and cleaner resources. I'm particularly excited about these storage opportunities. In fact, earlier this month, I visited the Moss Landing project, where we have one of the largest utility-owned storage facilities in the world, and a great example of a brownfield conversion from fossil fuels to batteries, leveraging the existing transmission resources. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities to add battery storage across our territories, including opportunities in high fire threat areas. Another major initiative is, in fact, our microgrid program. There are many locations across our high fire threat service area, where microgrids make a lot of sense. One example is in Mariposa County, where we had 5 customers that lost power in 2019 when the line serving them was destroyed. There, we're deploying a utility-owned hybrid renewable stand-alone power system to energize these isolated customers. This option is designed to reliably repower the customer without the need to rebuild the overhead lines. The remote grid offers an alternative at a lower lifetime cost and importantly, at a lower risk of future fire. As you can see, we've got a lot going on here at PG&E. The company has embraced the new vision. The senior leadership team is focused on achieving what all 25,000 PG&Eers and all of our other stakeholders in California want, a company that delivers clean, affordable, reliable energy safely. We'll meet that objective through a relentless focus on people, planet and prosperity, underpinned by performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Patti. As Patti mentioned earlier, we've started the year focused on execution against the goals we set forth in 2021, including on financial and regulatory matters. I plan to cover our Q1 results and then cover regulatory updates. But just to provide a few highlights up front: first, we're on track for our year-end earnings per share guidance. We're maintaining our 2021 equity guidance range. We've obtained our wildfire liability insurance coverage early this year, totaling $900 million. And we continue to gain financial clarity through progress on our key regulatory cases. As I mentioned, we're on track for the 2021 non-GAAP core earnings per share range we set out at $0.95 to $1.05. You can see here on Slide 8, our results for the first quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings for the quarter came in at $487 million or $0.23. We recorded GAAP earnings of $120 million or $0.06, including noncore items, also shown here. Moving to Slide 9. This shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $0.23 per share for Q1 2021 versus the $0.89 per share for Q1 2020 or $0.27 per share after adjusting for the increase in shares outstanding. EPS decreased $0.03 related to unrecoverable interest expense, $0.01 from the timing of nuclear refueling outages, $0.01 from the timing of taxes that will net to 0 over the year, $0.01 from wildfire mitigation costs above authorized and $0.01 from miscellaneous items. The decreases were partially offset by $0.03 of growth in rate base earnings. Moving to Slide 10. Our guidance for some of our noncore items has changed. I'll start with bankruptcy and legal costs. We've increased the high and low end of our range by $30 million to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, reflecting an increase in legal and other fees as we work through the final bankruptcy stages. Now I'll cover the updates on the 2019 to 2020 wildfire-related costs. On 2019 Kincade Fire costs, we have increased the claims accrual by $175 million to a total of $800 million. This reflects increased claims data as well as recent interactions with insurance providers and public entities. Our guidance also now includes $10 million for cleanup and repair costs related to the 2020 Zogg Fire. While not reflected in our guidance because we have sufficient insurance to offset the costs, I'll also note that we increased our accrual for claims related to the Zogg Fire by $25 million to a total of $300 million. This is primarily due to our conversations with public entities and other litigation plaintiffs. Next, the net securitization inception impact has been updated. We expect, assuming the language of both components of the proceeding hold to record an approximately $150 million pickup for the year following a final nonappealable decision and anticipate that the timing of the charge we previously guided to will largely coincide with the sale of shares by the fire victims trust over future periods. Last year, the prior period net regulatory recoveries item has decreased $80 million to a $60 million pickup for the year. This reflects the impact of a FERC order denying our request for rehearing on TO18. Continuing the 2021 guidance. On our financing plan, as Patti mentioned, we are maintaining our equity guidance of 0 to $400 million for the year. We're evaluating various options, such as an at-the-market equity program to provide flexibility to issue shares within the range, if needed. We'll also be active in the debt capital markets. As you know, we have 2 securitization proceedings pending at the CPUC. First is our $7.5 billion rate neutral securitization application. The CPUC issued its decision approving the costs under the stress test methodology on April 23, which justifies the amount we requested and the offsetting impact from the creation of the customer credit trust. We expect the CPUC to vote out the decision on the financing order on May 6, giving us the authority to issue securitization bonds. We plan to move expeditiously to issue the securitized debt once the decisions become final and nonappealable. The timing depends on whether there is a challenge to the decision. And if so, how quickly it is resolved? But we expect to complete this issuance later this year or early 2022. And as a reminder, the proceeds of the securitization will be used to retire $6 billion of utility temporary debt and also allow us to accelerate payments to the Fire Victims trust. One of our key principles in pursuing the structure is also maintained, which is a transaction structure that is expected to be rate neutral while receiving off credit treatment for the benefit of the utility and our customers. We also filed a request for our first tranche of wildfire safety and risk reduction securitization at the CPUC, as authorized in AB 1054. Our request totals roughly $1.2 billion and reflects the work we completed in 2020 and a forecasted expenditures for 2021. We expect to receive a decision on the financing application in late June. Along with our planned securitization issuances, we'll have additional utility debt issuances over the rest of 2021, including potentially later this quarter. Another key update is our early insurance renewal, which I touched on earlier. But this year, we decided to target obtaining insurance coverage well before the start of the traditional wildfire season. In April, we were successful in securing approximately $900 million of wildfire insurance for 2021 through 2022. From a regulatory perspective, we remain on track to file our 2023 general rate case by the end of June. Our focused investments to reduce wildfire risk and enhanced public safety will continue to be highlighted in this case. The structure of the filing will be different in 2 notable ways: first, we'll incorporate both electric distribution and our gas transmission and storage business; and second, the case will cover 4 years, 2023 through 2026, rather than 3 years, providing certainty of revenues over a longer horizon. This clarity underpins our longer-term projection, where our investment in critical safety and risk reduction efforts across our electric, gas and generation systems is at the core of 8.5% rate base growth. Our strong rate base growth, a disciplined approach to delevering our balance sheet while managing our equity needs, drives our 10% non-GAAP core earnings CAGR. And with that, I'll turn it over to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Chris. As I said, it is an exciting time here at PG&E. We will meet the challenges that lie ahead, such as ending catastrophic wildfires by demanding excellence of ourselves in our wildfire prevention work, creating culture of performance by building the lean operating system on a regional basis across the enterprise during 2021, and continuing our focus on delivering clean energy to our customers through the latest technologies in battery storage, electric vehicle infrastructure and micro grid solutions. Our financial performance is driven by these 3 focus areas. We can deliver on these objectives and thereby serve our customers and our investors better than ever before. We are on the path to a new era at PG&E, focused on people, planet and prosperity underpinned by performance. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Congrats on all the continued progress of your team. Perhaps at the outset, if I can ask, Chris, maybe, you mentioned keeping the 0 to $400 million of equity range and looking at the aftermarket, can you talk about some of the updated puts and takes as to how you think about potentially needed to access equity here, if you don't mind?\nChris Foster: Sure thing. Julien, in short, it's -- we kind of have to start with the start, which is the CPUC has not completed yet the final decision on the financing order for our securitization case. So again, we're looking at soon here, that's May 6. Certainly, that's our -- really the first gating item there. And then beyond that, as we mentioned today, we're certainly still working through some legacy legal items. We did update for both Zogg and Kincade, and we are in some ongoing discussions there as well. So from an approach for this quarter, we wanted to be sure to be appropriately conservative as we work our way through some of those issues.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And can you just elaborate a little bit more on what the issues you're working through there? And perhaps, if you can elaborate anything at these expected time lines on resolution there as best you see it, I guess, that it's always quite difficult?\nChris Foster: Sure, Julien, it's hard to be specific, as you can imagine. We did note in our disclosures today that we are in live conversations is how I would think about it on both the Kincade Fire and the Zogg Fire, Kincade particular, with the -- related to the insurance claims of the subrogated claims as well as public entities. And similarly, on the Zogg Fire with public entities as well as some individual plaintiffs. So obviously, just the complexity of some of the cases, it's hard for me to be specific about timing of resolution, but certainly want to move forward as expeditiously as possible, knowing the impact to victims.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Can you hear me?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, we can hear you, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: So maybe first, just a high-level question. The stock's been relatively weak, and I think it's now trading at less -- more than a 50% discount to the average utility. And so I guess just to somebody who was an outsider kind of coming in and now spent several months getting very in tune with the company in California and just the regulatory structure environment, et cetera, and then also the wildfire risk, just I'd be curious your thoughts on does it make any sense that PG&E would trade more than 50% below the average utility?\nPatti Poppe: Well, Steve, you can imagine I ask myself that question quite routinely. As I've gotten on the ground here and really gotten on solid footing, there's a couple of things that I think about and I observe and actually makes me very helpful. One is the regulatory construct in California was a pleasant surprise. I long heard about the regulatory construct, it's actually very good. We've got multiyear general rate cases, pass-through costs for commodity procurement, decoupling, separate cost of capital proceedings. It's a good construct that provides for reliable outcomes. The State of California recognizes and obviously sees and is experiencing the risk of wildfire. The state and we at PG&E as well as all of the IOUs have learned a lot about wildfire mitigation. I have a little saying associated with our lean operating system that says you can't fix what you don't know about. And we know a lot about what we're doing now under these conditions. And the state has stepped up, the commitment to increase, the equipment increased, fire and forest health, fire prevention increased, fire crews, I think the CAL FIRE and all of our firefighters across the state have demonstrated their incredible capacity and their improvement and everything they've done to fight wildfires. So it really comes down to the question I ask myself about us here at PG&E, can we, in fact, perform? And I wouldn't be here, Steve, if I didn't believe that we can. And this lean operating system that we talk about all the time is because we talk about it all the time because it is how we will create this culture of performance. It is what we've deployed against our wildfire mitigation plan for this year. We're seeing results of it right now as we speak. And so I just have to tell you, I think that a lot of companies have a lot of different kind of risks, and you can't fix what you don't know about. We know about this risk. We've gotten incredibly sophisticated about dealing with this risk. And we've got the team for the time to deliver on this risk. And so I'm a believer. And I guess I'd just say that. If I believe, I think there's a lot of reasons for other people to believe in PCG.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. That's helpful. Just on your comment on the Sonoma District Attorney filing on Kincade Fire, just have they given you any rationale for the criminal charges there? What is the basis?\nPatti Poppe: Well, they've certainly outlined what the charges are. And so the basis for the charges are somewhat implied. I would say this, Sonoma County District Attorney has a constituency. She's elected. She has a job to do. We disagree with those charges. We don't think there's a criminal basis for those charges. We will fight those charges. And again, the whole thing comes back to the same -- every rock, I find, Steve, everything I learn, every time I see an opportunity, it's the same answer. The same answer is improve our performance, implement our wildfire mitigation plan, prevent these disasters from happening in the future, be a company that can be relied upon to deliver and prevent incidents. And that's what we are doing, and that is the exclusive focus for myself and my team is on making sure that we create that culture of performance and that we make it safe here in California and catastrophic wildfires caused by our equipment.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. And one last question. Just any update on the status of this grantor trust election and then just any update on intentions of the Fire Victims Trust with their stake in the company?\nChris Foster: Sure. Steve, it's Chris. I'll take that. I think it's -- we're on a good path is the short answer. At this stage, we do have the private letter ruling that's positive from the IRS. We have good alignment in terms of shared benefit for both the Fire Victims Trust and the company toward completing this work. And just yesterday, we had approval in the bankruptcy court for the motion that came forward for our share exchange. So that was a good data point literally [ph] from yesterday. Going forward, I think there's probably a couple of gates to think about in considerations. The first would be that was mentioned yesterday in court that there's a California entity where there need to be approval, which is, I believe, in the third week of May for the approach, then we'll be working on finalizing some of the definitive documents that we're pursuing. And so ultimately, I think at this stage, we continue to be on a good path and largely you're kind of looking at that May time frame to ideally be able to position to elect.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And just to clarify that, the exchange of stock with you does not require the trust to sell stock to the market, that's just an exchange with you?\nChris Foster: Thank you for that question because I think there's been a little bit of confusion around it. That is correct. It is -- you can almost think about it as an instantaneous exchange -- so with the company. So it's not -- actually does not create a mandate to sell.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: I guess, I wanted to start off around the increased drought risk since the Wildfire Mitigation Plan was submitted. In light of some of the recent developments, is there any opportunities to amend or derisk the wildfire risk in the upcoming season in light of some of the changing weather conditions within your service territory.\nPatti Poppe: One of the things -- Ryan, nice to hear your voice. We -- one of the things that we're doing is we're drilling earlier. We have this excellent partnership with our community safety organizations, our firefighters, and we are drilling -- doing those drills in preparation for the wildfire season earlier given the drought conditions. And so we're going to be doing south and central in May, and we'll do the drills in the north in July. That's an important part of getting ready for and being aligned and coordinated. During an emergency response, that coordination is incredibly important and delivers better outcomes. So I'd say that's one thing that we're doing. But more than everything -- anything, we're executing to our plan, and much of our plan is scheduled to be in place. Early by September 1, some of our work will be complete, but a lot -- we're doing work every single day. So we're derisking the system every single day with our hardening efforts and our equipment upgrades. And so we're just -- we're absolutely zeroed in.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then in terms of the $900 million wildfire insurance cost that I think Chris had highlighted that you had purchased, can you provide a little color as to why you made that election earlier this year? And what the pricing and terms were to the extent you're able to comment for that insurance purchase?\nChris Foster: Sure thing. Ryan, the way I would think about this is we were just looking at the situation where in previous years, our policy ran from July 31 -- excuse me, from August 1 until July 31 of any given year. And the thinking was if we were able to move that just strategically earlier in the year, we give ourselves some space from the start of the traditional fire season. And so what we saw, as a result, if you look at it year-over-year, we have an increased amount of insurance from about $868 million up to $900 million for this year. We have greater policy coverage in and of itself in terms of the elements of the policy that we have are improved, and we were able to achieve this increase at a lower cost relative to last year's coverage. So we think it was -- the team did a lot of work there to make sure we're in a good position for this fire season. So again, it gets us to $900 million for this year.\nRyan Levine: Okay. Appreciate it. And what about in terms of pricing on the $900 million?\nChris Foster: Sure. We've got a good -- sure, exactly. We're looking at pricing there where we break out because it's in multiple policy towers, Ryan. One is a multiyear tower, that's about $600 million that runs for multiple years. And then we have a breakout specifically for the incremental above that, that gets us to $900 million for this year. And we're happy to follow up on any of the specific tower details for you, if you'd like to. We have provided today additional disclosure within our 10-Q that I would point you to as well. It's a little bit more detail than we've done in the past to try to give you help there.\nRyan Levine: Okay, great. And then maybe just one clarifying question around the equity issuance plan. Is there any -- outside of the highlighted, the securitization proceedings and the legacy claims, is there any changes in working capital that we should keep in mind, given the pace of COVID or exit from COVID?\nChris Foster: I appreciate that question. Ryan, as I think about other factors, just kind of more broadly speaking in terms of cash, it's not really -- there's no real working capital shifts here. Certainly, a meaningful effort that we're undertaking right now is the execution of the sale of our San Francisco headquarters. So certainly, that's a cash impacting item, both from a timing standpoint and a magnitude. And the team is underway now with the broker and is -- we'll be moving forward. So at this stage, again, just kind of working through those details. Hard to be more specific on that, given we're currently evaluating bids, but excited to get that moving forward as well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.\nJonathan Arnold: Just one quick one for Chris first, and I have a broader question. Chris, on the -- could you just explain the recent change in the timing of when you would recognize the loss that you had previously expected to be more upfront? I thought that you were expecting the grantor trust election when you updated last quarter. So I'm just trying to figure out what changed in the timing there?\nChris Foster: Absolutely. Jonathan, what I would start with, I have to say just kind of framing this, if you take a step back, we've been appreciative of the pace with which the CPUC has moved on our securitization cases. And explicitly, as you can see in the decision, there's a recognition of the benefits to customers, to the Fire Victims Trust and it's aligned with the goals as I stated there for both SB 901 and AB 1054 in terms of improving the company's business risk profile. So I think that, that's important just to be aware of in the back. So as we reevaluated and updated our accounting, we wanted to be sure to give you the clearest picture possible of the net impacts across both the grantor trust treatment as well as the securitization outcome. And so we would expect to record that $150 million pickup for the year, following a final nonappealable decision. Then we'd anticipate that the timing of the shareholder-funded charge we previously guided to will largely coincide with the sale of shares by the Fire Victims Trust over future periods. So it's really -- for us, this is really about a change in timing for the expense itself that we're reflecting and updating today to the positive.\nJonathan Arnold: Just the timing of how you're going to recognize it as opposed to when the cash flows may or may not occur?\nChris Foster: That's correct. That's right.\nJonathan Arnold: I'll leave a feedback there. And then just on -- you've obviously mentioned you're going to host this Analyst Day in August, could we get maybe a little sense of what you'll be hoping to accomplish there and what to be expecting?\nPatti Poppe: Well, first of all, we can't wait to have everybody here with us in California safely, of course. It all hinges on status of COVID, but we feel good that it's -- absolutely, we want everybody to hold the date and make your plans. We look forward to first introducing you to the team, demonstrating our wildfire mitigation planning in action, gets you up close and personal with the incredible technical talent that we have here at the company that I can't wait for you to meet that gives me the confidence that I think will give you the confidence as well. And then also more broadly, talking about our commitment to a culture of performance and talk about our clean energy plan. This is -- it's an exciting part of the PG&E story that certainly is underreported right now. And I understand that, but we can't wait to give that some daylight and help people get exposed to and excited about the future that PG&E has here serving the people of California. So no substitute for face-to-face. Can't wait to see you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Byrd: A lot has been covered. I wanted to just talk about the CPUC and their assessment of the, I guess, the long-term future of natural gas. And just curious sort of your thoughts, and dialogue with the CPUC, anything you would highlight there?\nPatti Poppe: I know it's a question on people's minds. I do think that in all the clean energy scenarios, certainly in the near term, say, the next decade, next 15 years, there's a need for natural gas as continued bridge fuel. And from an LDC perspective, our customers still want natural gas. And we're going to have to figure out how to make sure that we minimize our methane emissions through our good practices. And every time we change -- upgrade a service or change the main, we're reducing our fugitive emissions. We feel great about that. There's more to be done, though, to really think about what's the long-term role of natural gas here in California specifically. And so we're in the process of doing some strategic planning where we're asking ourselves all those questions. And when the time is right, we'll talk more about that publicly.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: I think I have probably one for Patti, and one or two for Chris. Patti, when we look at your CapEx spend, so if I come back and look at your slides that you have, and your very progressive goal to eliminate all utility-caused wildfires, if I look at the gray bars on Slide 11, are those funds that you need to spend to be able to hit those goals? And were those funds, meaning the embedded in the gray bar, things you wouldn't actually spend if you didn't get state regulatory approval, but it would put that goal of eliminating utility-caused wildfires at risk?\nPatti Poppe: Well, I'd say there's 2 things that help us mitigate utility-caused ignition risk. One is our hardening of our system. And so obviously, the investments that we're making there are very important, and we have a widely alignment with the CPUC and the Wildfire Safety Division. In fact, the Safety Division Director spent 3 days with us just a week ago, actually out in the field, observing our mitigation efforts and what we're doing to harden the system and the enhanced vegetation management efforts that we're taking. And so I would say we broadly have alignment on investments necessary to do our work. But we also mitigate risk and prevent ignition and specifically on catastrophic wildfire through our PSPS program. And so that's another important complement, too. And we try and represent this notion that -- in the near term, PSPS is our backstop, and it needs to be an important measure that we take to protect people's safety and prevent fires of consequence. But over time, our hardening investments, as you've described, will help to mitigate the actual source of the ignition in the first place. And so I'm getting pretty excited about what we're learning about how to make that happen through new technologies as well as just some of the fundamentals of undergrounding the right portions of the grid, doing these remote grids where necessary, conductor, hardening as well as all the other equipment that we're learning about and utilizing. Some of it quite traditional, some of it new and exciting. So that capital plan really does a major part of what we need to do to mitigate wildfire hazards.\nMichael Lapides: But if you didn't get approval for those gray bars in this upcoming case or in some of the memo accounts, would you spend it anyway because it is the thing that need to happen on the system to eliminate wildfire risk?\nChris Foster: Michael, it's Chris. I'll go ahead and just maybe build on that as well. The advantage that we have in the state is really now we have annually filed wildfire mitigation plan. So in essence, it provides -- it's really good transparency into year-over-year how we're adjusting the plan, how our risk model allows us to evolve our work. And it allows for greater alignment that Patti is alluding to. And so as you see there in those gray bars, we're trying to do our best to give that level of transparency. At the same time, we have a full expectation of recoveries of the work that directly tracks with what we filed in the plan previously. So there's a little bit of a regulatory lag in terms of the cost recovery. But ultimately, the good news is here, it doesn't experience the regulatory lag of a general rate case-oriented request because, again, annually, we're putting forward a wildfire mitigation plan, committing to the work that we're going to do. As long as we follow through on that, we have a good level of confidence of the recovery of those items in the gray. Additionally, we have -- we're aiming at end of June filing on our 2023 general rate case. And you can imagine, that's a bit of a catch-up opportunity there to give better line of sight to a multiyear investment prioritization there as well. So from both angles, it's actually a really good transparent process with the CPUC. And for us, it's really just about executing the work we commit to.\nMichael Lapides: Right. One follow-up, Chris, in your prepared remarks about the securitization and the timing, and you made the comment of end of year or beginning of '22 for the actual issuance. But then you followed that with a brief remark about assuming all appeals or litigation at risk. If litigation delayed the issuance, how does that impact, a couple of things, how does that impact when you make your $1 billion payment to the wildfire victims trust fund? And how does that impact your kind of earnings guidance, which assumes you'd be paying down a lot of debt that you're actually not recovering in the customer bill?\nChris Foster: Sure. Again, it's a bit of a scenario, but I hear where it's coming from. I think ultimately, what we're trying to do our best to do is provide the understanding that in the situation where there is an application for rehearing that would move forward or something of that sort that, we still envision a situation where we're prepared to execute this year. I did mention 2022 because the other factor that's in there, Michael, is just the market. And so at this size of the offering, we want to make sure to give ourselves the flexibility on the $7.5 billion. If we need to evaluate doing multiple tranches, there's a scenario where it could move -- a portion of it could move into 2022. So really, that's just our way of expressing. In one sense that there's a delay -- it would delay the final payment to the Fire Victims Trust. It could delay the initial contribution. But again, still looking at a situation where we'll execute this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho.\nPaul Fremont: I guess, if you fight the criminal charges in the courts, are you -- are we talking about months? Are we talking about years before you would potentially get a resolution out of the court on those matters?\nPatti Poppe: First of all, it's hard to say. And there's a lot of contributing factors to that. It could be months, it could also be up to potentially 2 years. So I would just say there's a range and a lot of factors that will go into that.\nPaul Fremont: And then I mean, is it fair to say that if there are criminal charges that would potentially come out of Zogg that we wouldn't know either way until roughly a year from now, just given the time line of when they acted on Kincade?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. It's really -- I guess, I would say that those things would be linked. If, in fact, there were criminal charges, we wouldn't -- if any of those stuck, we wouldn't know what the outcome of that would be until that happens. But again, let me just reiterate that we don't agree with these charges. And we definitely are going to fight them because that we just don't agree. And so that's really what our focus is right now.\nPaul Fremont: Right. No, I'm just trying to figure out because I would think that the criminal charges would weaken your ability to recover under 1054, is -- that's a fair assessment? If -- I mean, if the criminal charges were upheld?\nChris Foster: Paul, I think AB 1054 doesn't contemplate criminality in that way, just to be clear. If you think about -- you are accurate with the time frame, the time passage you mentioned there between any theoretical potential criminal charges that relate to the Zogg Fire is a similar kind of time frame. So it is accurate to think about the timing that way, but AB 1054 does not contemplate criminality in that way to the negative.\nPaul Fremont: Well, but it does basically set a negligent standard, right? So one could argue if you're found criminally liable that it would be more difficult for you to pass sort of that negligent standard, right?\nChris Foster: There's 2 tests. The first is at the CPUC in terms of cost recovery, which is essentially a substantial doubt construct that came about with AB 1054, which is similar to the existing kind of FERC-oriented language. And then the second gate, I think, is what you're pointing to, which is actually about replenishment of the wildfire fund. And so we're not necessarily in that scenario right now. That's the question of willful disregard, which is what I think most people try to mix in that question of criminality. So they're actually 2 separate things, Paul.\nPatti Poppe: And Paul, just to close this out. Just to be clear, just -- we can't speculate about all these conditions, but the most important thing to remember is we don't agree. We don't agree with the charges. And so we're going to fight that.\nPaul Fremont: Great. And maybe the last question for me on Zogg. I guess I've seen different accounts with respect to whether the tree that was involved was marked for removal or not? Is there any further clarification that you might be able to give on that tree?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. There's no new information to share on that, Paul.\nOperator: That concludes all questions for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Patti Poppe for closing remarks.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, April. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our future becomes significantly derisked as we deliver day in and day out. This is a long game, and we're in it to win it by serving our customers and our investors. We really do look forward to having you safely with us in California on August 9, for our Investor Day at our Wildfire Command Center. I want you to see the team that is in action and learn what I know. We are entering a new era at PG&E, grounded in our Triple Bottom Line that is underpinned by our performance. We will see you soon. And in the meantime, stay safe and be well.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti. As Patti mentioned earlier, we've started the year focused on execution against the goals we set forth in 2021, including on financial and regulatory matters. I plan to cover our Q1 results and then cover regulatory updates. But just to provide a few highlights up front: first, we're on track for our year-end earnings per share guidance. We're maintaining our 2021 equity guidance range. We've obtained our wildfire liability insurance coverage early this year, totaling $900 million. And we continue to gain financial clarity through progress on our key regulatory cases. As I mentioned, we're on track for the 2021 non-GAAP core earnings per share range we set out at $0.95 to $1.05. You can see here on Slide 8, our results for the first quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings for the quarter came in at $487 million or $0.23. We recorded GAAP earnings of $120 million or $0.06, including noncore items, also shown here. Moving to Slide 9. This shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $0.23 per share for Q1 2021 versus the $0.89 per share for Q1 2020 or $0.27 per share after adjusting for the increase in shares outstanding. EPS decreased $0.03 related to unrecoverable interest expense, $0.01 from the timing of nuclear refueling outages, $0.01 from the timing of taxes that will net to 0 over the year, $0.01 from wildfire mitigation costs above authorized and $0.01 from miscellaneous items. The decreases were partially offset by $0.03 of growth in rate base earnings. Moving to Slide 10. Our guidance for some of our noncore items has changed. I'll start with bankruptcy and legal costs. We've increased the high and low end of our range by $30 million to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, reflecting an increase in legal and other fees as we work through the final bankruptcy stages. Now I'll cover the updates on the 2019 to 2020 wildfire-related costs. On 2019 Kincade Fire costs, we have increased the claims accrual by $175 million to a total of $800 million. This reflects increased claims data as well as recent interactions with insurance providers and public entities. Our guidance also now includes $10 million for cleanup and repair costs related to the 2020 Zogg Fire. While not reflected in our guidance because we have sufficient insurance to offset the costs, I'll also note that we increased our accrual for claims related to the Zogg Fire by $25 million to a total of $300 million. This is primarily due to our conversations with public entities and other litigation plaintiffs. Next, the net securitization inception impact has been updated. We expect, assuming the language of both components of the proceeding hold to record an approximately $150 million pickup for the year following a final nonappealable decision and anticipate that the timing of the charge we previously guided to will largely coincide with the sale of shares by the fire victims trust over future periods. Last year, the prior period net regulatory recoveries item has decreased $80 million to a $60 million pickup for the year. This reflects the impact of a FERC order denying our request for rehearing on TO18. Continuing the 2021 guidance. On our financing plan, as Patti mentioned, we are maintaining our equity guidance of 0 to $400 million for the year. We're evaluating various options, such as an at-the-market equity program to provide flexibility to issue shares within the range, if needed. We'll also be active in the debt capital markets. As you know, we have 2 securitization proceedings pending at the CPUC. First is our $7.5 billion rate neutral securitization application. The CPUC issued its decision approving the costs under the stress test methodology on April 23, which justifies the amount we requested and the offsetting impact from the creation of the customer credit trust. We expect the CPUC to vote out the decision on the financing order on May 6, giving us the authority to issue securitization bonds. We plan to move expeditiously to issue the securitized debt once the decisions become final and nonappealable. The timing depends on whether there is a challenge to the decision. And if so, how quickly it is resolved? But we expect to complete this issuance later this year or early 2022. And as a reminder, the proceeds of the securitization will be used to retire $6 billion of utility temporary debt and also allow us to accelerate payments to the Fire Victims trust. One of our key principles in pursuing the structure is also maintained, which is a transaction structure that is expected to be rate neutral while receiving off credit treatment for the benefit of the utility and our customers. We also filed a request for our first tranche of wildfire safety and risk reduction securitization at the CPUC, as authorized in AB 1054. Our request totals roughly $1.2 billion and reflects the work we completed in 2020 and a forecasted expenditures for 2021. We expect to receive a decision on the financing application in late June. Along with our planned securitization issuances, we'll have additional utility debt issuances over the rest of 2021, including potentially later this quarter. Another key update is our early insurance renewal, which I touched on earlier. But this year, we decided to target obtaining insurance coverage well before the start of the traditional wildfire season. In April, we were successful in securing approximately $900 million of wildfire insurance for 2021 through 2022. From a regulatory perspective, we remain on track to file our 2023 general rate case by the end of June. Our focused investments to reduce wildfire risk and enhanced public safety will continue to be highlighted in this case. The structure of the filing will be different in 2 notable ways: first, we'll incorporate both electric distribution and our gas transmission and storage business; and second, the case will cover 4 years, 2023 through 2026, rather than 3 years, providing certainty of revenues over a longer horizon. This clarity underpins our longer-term projection, where our investment in critical safety and risk reduction efforts across our electric, gas and generation systems is at the core of 8.5% rate base growth. Our strong rate base growth, a disciplined approach to delevering our balance sheet while managing our equity needs, drives our 10% non-GAAP core earnings CAGR. And with that, I'll turn it over to Patti. Sure thing. Julien, in short, it's -- we kind of have to start with the start, which is the CPUC has not completed yet the final decision on the financing order for our securitization case. So again, we're looking at soon here, that's May 6. Certainly, that's our -- really the first gating item there. And then beyond that, as we mentioned today, we're certainly still working through some legacy legal items. We did update for both Zogg and Kincade, and we are in some ongoing discussions there as well. So from an approach for this quarter, we wanted to be sure to be appropriately conservative as we work our way through some of those issues. Sure, Julien, it's hard to be specific, as you can imagine. We did note in our disclosures today that we are in live conversations is how I would think about it on both the Kincade Fire and the Zogg Fire, Kincade particular, with the -- related to the insurance claims of the subrogated claims as well as public entities. And similarly, on the Zogg Fire with public entities as well as some individual plaintiffs. So obviously, just the complexity of some of the cases, it's hard for me to be specific about timing of resolution, but certainly want to move forward as expeditiously as possible, knowing the impact to victims. Sure. Steve, it's Chris. I'll take that. I think it's -- we're on a good path is the short answer. At this stage, we do have the private letter ruling that's positive from the IRS. We have good alignment in terms of shared benefit for both the Fire Victims Trust and the company toward completing this work. And just yesterday, we had approval in the bankruptcy court for the motion that came forward for our share exchange. So that was a good data point literally [ph] from yesterday. Going forward, I think there's probably a couple of gates to think about in considerations. The first would be that was mentioned yesterday in court that there's a California entity where there need to be approval, which is, I believe, in the third week of May for the approach, then we'll be working on finalizing some of the definitive documents that we're pursuing. And so ultimately, I think at this stage, we continue to be on a good path and largely you're kind of looking at that May time frame to ideally be able to position to elect. Thank you for that question because I think there's been a little bit of confusion around it. That is correct. It is -- you can almost think about it as an instantaneous exchange -- so with the company. So it's not -- actually does not create a mandate to sell. Sure thing. Ryan, the way I would think about this is we were just looking at the situation where in previous years, our policy ran from July 31 -- excuse me, from August 1 until July 31 of any given year. And the thinking was if we were able to move that just strategically earlier in the year, we give ourselves some space from the start of the traditional fire season. And so what we saw, as a result, if you look at it year-over-year, we have an increased amount of insurance from about $868 million up to $900 million for this year. We have greater policy coverage in and of itself in terms of the elements of the policy that we have are improved, and we were able to achieve this increase at a lower cost relative to last year's coverage. So we think it was -- the team did a lot of work there to make sure we're in a good position for this fire season. So again, it gets us to $900 million for this year. Sure. We've got a good -- sure, exactly. We're looking at pricing there where we break out because it's in multiple policy towers, Ryan. One is a multiyear tower, that's about $600 million that runs for multiple years. And then we have a breakout specifically for the incremental above that, that gets us to $900 million for this year. And we're happy to follow up on any of the specific tower details for you, if you'd like to. We have provided today additional disclosure within our 10-Q that I would point you to as well. It's a little bit more detail than we've done in the past to try to give you help there. I appreciate that question. Ryan, as I think about other factors, just kind of more broadly speaking in terms of cash, it's not really -- there's no real working capital shifts here. Certainly, a meaningful effort that we're undertaking right now is the execution of the sale of our San Francisco headquarters. So certainly, that's a cash impacting item, both from a timing standpoint and a magnitude. And the team is underway now with the broker and is -- we'll be moving forward. So at this stage, again, just kind of working through those details. Hard to be more specific on that, given we're currently evaluating bids, but excited to get that moving forward as well. Absolutely. Jonathan, what I would start with, I have to say just kind of framing this, if you take a step back, we've been appreciative of the pace with which the CPUC has moved on our securitization cases. And explicitly, as you can see in the decision, there's a recognition of the benefits to customers, to the Fire Victims Trust and it's aligned with the goals as I stated there for both SB 901 and AB 1054 in terms of improving the company's business risk profile. So I think that, that's important just to be aware of in the back. So as we reevaluated and updated our accounting, we wanted to be sure to give you the clearest picture possible of the net impacts across both the grantor trust treatment as well as the securitization outcome. And so we would expect to record that $150 million pickup for the year, following a final nonappealable decision. Then we'd anticipate that the timing of the shareholder-funded charge we previously guided to will largely coincide with the sale of shares by the Fire Victims Trust over future periods. So it's really -- for us, this is really about a change in timing for the expense itself that we're reflecting and updating today to the positive. That's correct. That's right. Michael, it's Chris. I'll go ahead and just maybe build on that as well. The advantage that we have in the state is really now we have annually filed wildfire mitigation plan. So in essence, it provides -- it's really good transparency into year-over-year how we're adjusting the plan, how our risk model allows us to evolve our work. And it allows for greater alignment that Patti is alluding to. And so as you see there in those gray bars, we're trying to do our best to give that level of transparency. At the same time, we have a full expectation of recoveries of the work that directly tracks with what we filed in the plan previously. So there's a little bit of a regulatory lag in terms of the cost recovery. But ultimately, the good news is here, it doesn't experience the regulatory lag of a general rate case-oriented request because, again, annually, we're putting forward a wildfire mitigation plan, committing to the work that we're going to do. As long as we follow through on that, we have a good level of confidence of the recovery of those items in the gray. Additionally, we have -- we're aiming at end of June filing on our 2023 general rate case. And you can imagine, that's a bit of a catch-up opportunity there to give better line of sight to a multiyear investment prioritization there as well. So from both angles, it's actually a really good transparent process with the CPUC. And for us, it's really just about executing the work we commit to. Sure. Again, it's a bit of a scenario, but I hear where it's coming from. I think ultimately, what we're trying to do our best to do is provide the understanding that in the situation where there is an application for rehearing that would move forward or something of that sort that, we still envision a situation where we're prepared to execute this year. I did mention 2022 because the other factor that's in there, Michael, is just the market. And so at this size of the offering, we want to make sure to give ourselves the flexibility on the $7.5 billion. If we need to evaluate doing multiple tranches, there's a scenario where it could move -- a portion of it could move into 2022. So really, that's just our way of expressing. In one sense that there's a delay -- it would delay the final payment to the Fire Victims Trust. It could delay the initial contribution. But again, still looking at a situation where we'll execute this year. Paul, I think AB 1054 doesn't contemplate criminality in that way, just to be clear. If you think about -- you are accurate with the time frame, the time passage you mentioned there between any theoretical potential criminal charges that relate to the Zogg Fire is a similar kind of time frame. So it is accurate to think about the timing that way, but AB 1054 does not contemplate criminality in that way to the negative. There's 2 tests. The first is at the CPUC in terms of cost recovery, which is essentially a substantial doubt construct that came about with AB 1054, which is similar to the existing kind of FERC-oriented language. And then the second gate, I think, is what you're pointing to, which is actually about replenishment of the wildfire fund. And so we're not necessarily in that scenario right now. That's the question of willful disregard, which is what I think most people try to mix in that question of criminality. So they're actually 2 separate things, Paul."

            "name": "Patti Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everybody. It's so great to be with you for our first quarter earnings call. We delivered solid Q1 non-GAAP core earnings of $0.23 per share in our first quarter. This morning, we're reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance of $0.95 to $1.05. We're also maintaining our longer-term 2021 to 2025 non-GAAP core earnings per share CAGR of 10% that we gave on the Q4 call. We're holding our equity guidance range for 2021 at 0 to $400 million. We're taking a conservative approach as we await a final decision on the securitization order from the CPUC and as we continue to make progress on legacy issues. Rest assured, Chris and I are laser-focused on minimizing our 2021 equity needs. We want you to have confidence in our forecast, and we have several more months this year to make progress on the equity range. Chris will describe the financials a bit more in a few minutes. As I finished up my first 100-day listening tour, we've accelerated our move from listening to action. Our priorities fall into 3 categories: first, to end utility-caused catastrophic wildfires by demanding excellence of ourselves in our wildfire prevention work; second, to create a culture of performance by deploying our lean operating system across the enterprise during 2021; and third, by continuing to lead in the clean energy transition through the latest technologies in battery storage, electric vehicle infrastructure and microgrid solutions. Our near and long-term financial performance is inextricably linked to these 3 focus areas. We can deliver on these objectives and thereby serve our customers and our investors better than ever before. Thankfully, I don't need to do this alone. I've hired key senior leaders, who represent the best in the business. We added some very experienced senior leaders to the PG&E team, who we highlighted on the Q4 call. Since then, we've announced additional new senior leaders to round out our team, including Chris Foster as CFO; Jason Glickman, as EVP of Engineering, Planning and Strategy; Carla Peterman, as EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Wade Smith, as Head of Electric Operations. I'm pleased with the team that we have here at PG&E, and I would stack our operating experience up against anyone. The common thread in all of our leaders is a tenacity to perform and the skills to deliver. Before diving into the substantial changes we're making here at PG&E, there's something I'd like to address right up front. Earlier this month, the Sonoma county district attorney filed criminal charges related to the Kincade Fire against the company. We do not agree with these charges, and we'll defend them in legal proceedings. In the meantime, we'll make it right by working to resolve victim's claims fairly and justly. And each day, we'll continue to make it safe by prioritizing the work that needs to be done to deliver energy to our customers. One organizational enhancement I'd like to highlight is our interim wildfire risk organization announced last month, led by Sumeet Singh. This team has been instrumental in responding to the criticism we faced on our enhanced vegetation work. As a part of our lean operating system implementation, the federal monitor and the governor's operational observer are included in our daily operating reviews associated with wildfire work. You may wonder, won't it lean take years to implement? The answer is no. We've already started our implementation on our most important work and the system will provide benefits immediately as well as for years to come as we grow our capability and our maturity. One simple example happened in the very first week of our daily operating reviews, we were off track on our distribution sectionalizing device installations. We completed 12 devices as compared to a goal of 30. And as a result of the daily operating review, we gained visibility of the problem and built a recovery plan that's been outlined and managed to make sure we get back on track. Look, it may sound very simple, but this is a sort of thing that gets lost without an operating system. Next thing we know, the problem snowballs, we're too late to fix it, another commitment missed. Great operators keep their promises and have a system to manage them. We will be a great operator, thanks to our lean operating system. We have the right team implementing the lean system on this critical work, and there'll be a valuable resource as we implement lean across the enterprise throughout the year. On that point, in early March, I attended a CPUC workshop on a regionalization filing. I was able to share my thoughts on how PG&E could benefit from implementing a lean operating process on a localized level. We'll leverage the benefit of the lean system and the regionalized teams focused on engaging customers and communities and incorporating their input. We've listened and we've seen that we need to improve our local presence and our performance, and we are going to do just that. As we implement the lean operating system, we'll continue to uncover opportunities to improve and take actions to close the gap. In addition to getting our senior leadership team in place, establishing our lean operating system and ensuring a hometown experience, we're able to begin measuring our performance to the Triple Bottom Line of people, planet and California's prosperity. For PG&E and for California, serving our planet means continuing our leadership role delivering clean energy to our customers. In 2020, 88% of our bundled sales were from greenhouse gas-free sources of energy, more than twice the average across U.S. utilities. We're not resting there, and we're working to bring on over 900 megawatts of additional battery storage by this August, assuring that we have both adequate supply and cleaner resources. I'm particularly excited about these storage opportunities. In fact, earlier this month, I visited the Moss Landing project, where we have one of the largest utility-owned storage facilities in the world, and a great example of a brownfield conversion from fossil fuels to batteries, leveraging the existing transmission resources. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities to add battery storage across our territories, including opportunities in high fire threat areas. Another major initiative is, in fact, our microgrid program. There are many locations across our high fire threat service area, where microgrids make a lot of sense. One example is in Mariposa County, where we had 5 customers that lost power in 2019 when the line serving them was destroyed. There, we're deploying a utility-owned hybrid renewable stand-alone power system to energize these isolated customers. This option is designed to reliably repower the customer without the need to rebuild the overhead lines. The remote grid offers an alternative at a lower lifetime cost and importantly, at a lower risk of future fire. As you can see, we've got a lot going on here at PG&E. The company has embraced the new vision. The senior leadership team is focused on achieving what all 25,000 PG&Eers and all of our other stakeholders in California want, a company that delivers clean, affordable, reliable energy safely. We'll meet that objective through a relentless focus on people, planet and prosperity, underpinned by performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris. Thank you, Chris. As I said, it is an exciting time here at PG&E. We will meet the challenges that lie ahead, such as ending catastrophic wildfires by demanding excellence of ourselves in our wildfire prevention work, creating culture of performance by building the lean operating system on a regional basis across the enterprise during 2021, and continuing our focus on delivering clean energy to our customers through the latest technologies in battery storage, electric vehicle infrastructure and micro grid solutions. Our financial performance is driven by these 3 focus areas. We can deliver on these objectives and thereby serve our customers and our investors better than ever before. We are on the path to a new era at PG&E, focused on people, planet and prosperity underpinned by performance. Operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, we can hear you, Steve. Well, Steve, you can imagine I ask myself that question quite routinely. As I've gotten on the ground here and really gotten on solid footing, there's a couple of things that I think about and I observe and actually makes me very helpful. One is the regulatory construct in California was a pleasant surprise. I long heard about the regulatory construct, it's actually very good. We've got multiyear general rate cases, pass-through costs for commodity procurement, decoupling, separate cost of capital proceedings. It's a good construct that provides for reliable outcomes. The State of California recognizes and obviously sees and is experiencing the risk of wildfire. The state and we at PG&E as well as all of the IOUs have learned a lot about wildfire mitigation. I have a little saying associated with our lean operating system that says you can't fix what you don't know about. And we know a lot about what we're doing now under these conditions. And the state has stepped up, the commitment to increase, the equipment increased, fire and forest health, fire prevention increased, fire crews, I think the CAL FIRE and all of our firefighters across the state have demonstrated their incredible capacity and their improvement and everything they've done to fight wildfires. So it really comes down to the question I ask myself about us here at PG&E, can we, in fact, perform? And I wouldn't be here, Steve, if I didn't believe that we can. And this lean operating system that we talk about all the time is because we talk about it all the time because it is how we will create this culture of performance. It is what we've deployed against our wildfire mitigation plan for this year. We're seeing results of it right now as we speak. And so I just have to tell you, I think that a lot of companies have a lot of different kind of risks, and you can't fix what you don't know about. We know about this risk. We've gotten incredibly sophisticated about dealing with this risk. And we've got the team for the time to deliver on this risk. And so I'm a believer. And I guess I'd just say that. If I believe, I think there's a lot of reasons for other people to believe in PCG. Well, they've certainly outlined what the charges are. And so the basis for the charges are somewhat implied. I would say this, Sonoma County District Attorney has a constituency. She's elected. She has a job to do. We disagree with those charges. We don't think there's a criminal basis for those charges. We will fight those charges. And again, the whole thing comes back to the same -- every rock, I find, Steve, everything I learn, every time I see an opportunity, it's the same answer. The same answer is improve our performance, implement our wildfire mitigation plan, prevent these disasters from happening in the future, be a company that can be relied upon to deliver and prevent incidents. And that's what we are doing, and that is the exclusive focus for myself and my team is on making sure that we create that culture of performance and that we make it safe here in California and catastrophic wildfires caused by our equipment. One of the things -- Ryan, nice to hear your voice. We -- one of the things that we're doing is we're drilling earlier. We have this excellent partnership with our community safety organizations, our firefighters, and we are drilling -- doing those drills in preparation for the wildfire season earlier given the drought conditions. And so we're going to be doing south and central in May, and we'll do the drills in the north in July. That's an important part of getting ready for and being aligned and coordinated. During an emergency response, that coordination is incredibly important and delivers better outcomes. So I'd say that's one thing that we're doing. But more than everything -- anything, we're executing to our plan, and much of our plan is scheduled to be in place. Early by September 1, some of our work will be complete, but a lot -- we're doing work every single day. So we're derisking the system every single day with our hardening efforts and our equipment upgrades. And so we're just -- we're absolutely zeroed in. Well, first of all, we can't wait to have everybody here with us in California safely, of course. It all hinges on status of COVID, but we feel good that it's -- absolutely, we want everybody to hold the date and make your plans. We look forward to first introducing you to the team, demonstrating our wildfire mitigation planning in action, gets you up close and personal with the incredible technical talent that we have here at the company that I can't wait for you to meet that gives me the confidence that I think will give you the confidence as well. And then also more broadly, talking about our commitment to a culture of performance and talk about our clean energy plan. This is -- it's an exciting part of the PG&E story that certainly is underreported right now. And I understand that, but we can't wait to give that some daylight and help people get exposed to and excited about the future that PG&E has here serving the people of California. So no substitute for face-to-face. Can't wait to see you. I know it's a question on people's minds. I do think that in all the clean energy scenarios, certainly in the near term, say, the next decade, next 15 years, there's a need for natural gas as continued bridge fuel. And from an LDC perspective, our customers still want natural gas. And we're going to have to figure out how to make sure that we minimize our methane emissions through our good practices. And every time we change -- upgrade a service or change the main, we're reducing our fugitive emissions. We feel great about that. There's more to be done, though, to really think about what's the long-term role of natural gas here in California specifically. And so we're in the process of doing some strategic planning where we're asking ourselves all those questions. And when the time is right, we'll talk more about that publicly. Well, I'd say there's 2 things that help us mitigate utility-caused ignition risk. One is our hardening of our system. And so obviously, the investments that we're making there are very important, and we have a widely alignment with the CPUC and the Wildfire Safety Division. In fact, the Safety Division Director spent 3 days with us just a week ago, actually out in the field, observing our mitigation efforts and what we're doing to harden the system and the enhanced vegetation management efforts that we're taking. And so I would say we broadly have alignment on investments necessary to do our work. But we also mitigate risk and prevent ignition and specifically on catastrophic wildfire through our PSPS program. And so that's another important complement, too. And we try and represent this notion that -- in the near term, PSPS is our backstop, and it needs to be an important measure that we take to protect people's safety and prevent fires of consequence. But over time, our hardening investments, as you've described, will help to mitigate the actual source of the ignition in the first place. And so I'm getting pretty excited about what we're learning about how to make that happen through new technologies as well as just some of the fundamentals of undergrounding the right portions of the grid, doing these remote grids where necessary, conductor, hardening as well as all the other equipment that we're learning about and utilizing. Some of it quite traditional, some of it new and exciting. So that capital plan really does a major part of what we need to do to mitigate wildfire hazards. First of all, it's hard to say. And there's a lot of contributing factors to that. It could be months, it could also be up to potentially 2 years. So I would just say there's a range and a lot of factors that will go into that. Yes. It's really -- I guess, I would say that those things would be linked. If, in fact, there were criminal charges, we wouldn't -- if any of those stuck, we wouldn't know what the outcome of that would be until that happens. But again, let me just reiterate that we don't agree with these charges. And we definitely are going to fight them because that we just don't agree. And so that's really what our focus is right now. And Paul, just to close this out. Just to be clear, just -- we can't speculate about all these conditions, but the most important thing to remember is we don't agree. We don't agree with the charges. And so we're going to fight that. Yes. There's no new information to share on that, Paul. Thank you, April. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our future becomes significantly derisked as we deliver day in and day out. This is a long game, and we're in it to win it by serving our customers and our investors. We really do look forward to having you safely with us in California on August 9, for our Investor Day at our Wildfire Command Center. I want you to see the team that is in action and learn what I know. We are entering a new era at PG&E, grounded in our Triple Bottom Line that is underpinned by our performance. We will see you soon. And in the meantime, stay safe and be well."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the PG&E Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Release. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Arnold. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters.  First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's fourth quarter and full year earnings call presentation.  The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. And the slides, along with other relevant information, can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was released earlier this morning.  And with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on what I know is a busy earnings morning.  As you'll see on Slide 3, this morning, we reported full year 2022 core earnings of $1.10 per share, right on guidance. This was my second year with PG&E with results delivered on plan. No more, no less. As I like to say, we sweat the details so you don't have to.  Our simple, affordable model is designed to maximize work for our customers and deliver on our commitment to you, our investors, each and every year. Our $1.10 EPS for 2022 was up 10% from 2021 as planned. We're also reaffirming our 2023 core EPS guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23, up 10% at the midpoint, along with our previously stated longer-term targets of at least 10% EPS growth in 2024 and at least 9% for '25 and '26.  Also unchanged is our plan for no new equity through 2024. As you know, our sector-leading EPS growth is supported by robust capital investment and ongoing efficiency gains for the benefit of the 16 million Californians we serve. In fact, in 2022, we invested $9.6 billion of capital into our system for the benefit of our customers.  Our system has never been safer, and we continue to make it safer every day. I want to thank you, our investors, for your part in making that possible. The simple, affordable model underpins our confidence in reiterating our financial outlook today despite the very real challenges faced by most businesses in today's inflationary and uncertain economic environment.  Turning to Slide 4. We've made strong progress mitigating physical and financial risk. So here are some high points. On wildfire mitigation, we saw a 99% reduction in acres burned in 2022 relative to the average of the 3 years directly before implementation of Enhanced Powerline Safety Setting.  As we reported last quarter, we were able to successfully navigate extreme summer heat conditions. And in January, our system was put to the test again with an unprecedented series of winter storms, which were met with truly historic levels of performance from the PG&E team.  In addition to addressing physical risks, 2022 was a big year for our financial risk mitigation. We delivered our earnings guidance as well as non-fuel O&M cost reductions of 3% net of inflation. This was ahead of our 2% plan and was achieved in the face of the most challenging inflationary backdrop many of us have seen in our careers.  In our GRC, we added undergrounding while removing vegetation management expense, delivering long-term safety while keeping cost neutral for customers. We closed our $7.5 billion rate-neutral securitization and worked with California policymakers over the summer as they passed constructive legislation supporting our 10-year undergrounding plans and to extend the life of our Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. We view both as beneficial to customers and evidence of the greater trust we are building day in and day out with our stakeholders.  On the regulatory front, we appreciate the CPUC resolving both the 2022 and 2023 cost of capital proceedings last year. And in terms of customer savings, the Net Energy Metering 3.0 decision was a win for customers. We estimate it removes about $1 billion of cost shift through 2030 relative to NEM 2.0.  On Slide 5, we show some highlights on our historic January storm response. I want to emphasize that this story is about more than numbers on a page. This was us delivering for our hometowns, and our coworkers are at their best when put to the test.  During the first 2 weeks of 2023, hit by historic back-to-back to back-to-back atmospheric river storms, our electric team restored over 2.8 million customers through multiple waves of outages, and we had 95% back online within 24 hours during each of those events. January ranked as the top 5 storm in PG&E history and involved the largest contingent of resources we have ever mobilized, including around 7,200 dedicated personnel from 10 states.  The strength and speed of our response also resulted in us seeing improved customer satisfaction scores compared to prior storm-related outages. We've also adopted the standardized emergency management system and Internet command system. And with the support from California's Office of Emergency Services, we've been aligning training of our emergency center staff with our first responder public safety partners. When the time came, our team and an army of partners acted with skill and tenacity, protecting and serving each other and our hometown, and we couldn't be prouder of them.  On Slide 6, I'll recap our layers of protection against wildfire risk, which start with our core system hardening, vegetation management, inspections and repairs. When conditions warned, we supplement these with our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings and our Public Safety Power Shutoffs.  We calculate these layers of protection, including improved situational awareness and coordination with first responders, as delivering over 90% overall wildfire risk reduction. We've already hardened more than 1,200 miles since 2019, and we expect our overall risk reduction to further increase as we pursue our 10,000-mile undergrounding program. In the meantime, we continue to look for innovative new technology solutions such as partial voltage detection and down conductor technology to keep reducing that remaining 10%.  On Slide 7, we take a closer look at our 2022 wildfire risk mitigation performance. Historical data show that from 2012 to 2020, that's before we implemented EPSS, 95% of the acres and 100% of the structures burned were related to ignitions at times when conditions were at R3 or higher. While we were fortunate that 2022 didn't bring significant wind events for the year, there were still 31% more R3 or higher days than in 2018 to 2020. Despite this significant increase, we saw a reduction of 99% in the number of acres impacted by utility ignitions in 2022 over the same time period.  Slide 8 illustrates our simple, affordable model, which includes driving efficiency to make room for customer investment. You've heard us talk a lot about the lean operating system and our 4 basic plays.  In 2023, we're rolling out a fifth play, my personal favorite, waste elimination. And we see this as key to continuing to deliver our plans for both customers and investors.  Our primary constraint is customer affordability, on which we are laser-focused through our newly established bill ownership center led by Carla Peterman. The entire team is looking at the whole customer bill for savings, including energy supply costs, which we know are top of mind.  We have a lot of opportunity to eliminate waste, improve our customers' experience, make our system cleaner and more resilient all the while reducing cost. We can do more for less.  The examples keep piling up. So I felt I needed to bring back my story of the month. So here we go. This month's story is about work we are doing to improve efficiency in our new business area.  Presently, our new customer connections take too long from start to finish. As I recently told a group of California builders, we can, and we will do better. In fact, it's another perfect application for our lean operating system, and specifically, waste elimination.  The team invited our developers and builders to come in and work with us to redesign our processes and share their pain points. We conducted a design thinking workshop. And through rapid prototyping, we can see the path to taking the cycle time down dramatically, improving our ability to both do the hook up on time and in less time. Imagine the rework, the waste, the frustration, the delays we can eliminate.  One challenge is that 64% of the new connection requests we receive today end up being canceled for a variety of reasons. We do too much engineering before we are sure it will even be used. This wastes both time and money, and it also is demoralizing for our talented engineers when much of their work never sees the light of day.  We can dramatically improve how we show up for our new customers. And by doing that, we can free up more time and resources to reinvest back into the system. This is just one of the areas where we are delivering more for customers with every dollar spent. Now that's what I call enabling California's prosperity.  Turning to Slide 9. You may recognize this chart, which shows how we executed in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, we faced headwinds early in the year. Our recovery work then put us ahead of plan. This is all part of the playbook we're running now at PG&E.  We plan conservatively, and we remain nimble, protecting investors from the downside. And when there's upside, we will redeploy it for the benefit of customers, which, in many cases, means pulling work forward and protecting future years. Consistency is the name of the game.  You can see it play out again in 2022. We faced headwinds, including a possible cost of capital reset. We have planned conservatively, though, and we're able to more than offset this and other pressures, allowing us to redeploy again on behalf of our customers and still deliver 10% EPS growth.  Employing the simple, affordable model, we plan to consistently manage the work and deliver our earnings targets, no more and no less. And when we can, we will redeploy favorability in the business on behalf of customers and look to derisk future years with a view to delivering our consistent growth trajectory.  Lots of people say to me, \"Patti, what if this happens or what if that happens?\" This is what we manage at PG&E. Come what may, we have the capability to be nimble and adapt to those challenging and changing conditions. It's a capability that can be taught and learned. As I've said many times, we ride the roller coaster so you don't have to. You can expect to see more of this in 2023 and beyond.  Moving to Slide 10. You can see the progress we made in 2022 as we continue on our journey to build trust with policymakers while creating the stability necessary to attract capital to invest on behalf of customers.  Already, in 2023, we're pleased with the expedited resolution of our self-insurance settlement reached as part of our General Rate Case. This innovative approach enjoys intervenous support and most importantly, can result in up to $1.8 billion of savings for customers over the 4-year GRC period with as much as $300 million expected in 2023.  We also have a number of important catalysts on the horizon. Each of the 4 items you'll see here in blue contain important benefits for our customers and for California. We'll continue to work every day toward timely and constructive outcomes, but we don't do big bets here at PG&E. And I want to remind you that we continue to plan conservatively even as I look forward to seeing more green check marks on this slide.  Turning to Slide 11. Let's take a look at our 2022 report card. While the material fire did not result in any serious injuries and the estimated liability is well within our available insurance, it did cause us to miss our goal of 0 CPUC reportable admissions of 100 acres or more.  We put 180 miles of lines underground last year, exceeding our 175-mile target. And we chose to redirect capital investment to maximize risk reduction during the year, which changed our plans for gas main replacements.  We exceeded our 2% annual O&M cost reduction, offsetting inflation and delivering net savings of 3%. Yes, that is net of inflationary pressure. We see plenty of potential to continue 2% net O&M reduction for many years ahead by working smarter and maximizing value for our customers and investors.  Core EPS came in right on plan at 10%, while we delivered 6% rate base growth in what was the final year of our GRC cycle. Lastly, we were pleased that Moody's recognized our significant progress on mitigating risk and improving relationships in the state when they revised our credit outlook to positive earlier this month.  On Slide 12, we introduced our 2023 report card. One key change is to our headline wildfire metric, where we're sticking with a target of 0 and resulting a new OEIS metric for catastrophic wildfires. This measure lines up with our future wildfire mitigation plans, and we think it's a better one for capturing events that are of real significance from both a customer and investor perspective.  We remain committed to our 10,000-mile undergrounding goal and to achieving our unit cost targets. We'll be filing our 10-year plan later this year with more details.  Our 2% O&M reduction plan shouldn't be a surprise either, and there are no changes to any of our previous financial targets through 2026. We're excited to be adding another year, 2027, to our rate base and CapEx as we look to give you more visibility into our long-term plan.  Our headline 5-year rate base CAGR of 9.5% remains the same, but it's now based off 2022 actuals and runs through 2027. We're feeling really good about what we accomplished in 2022, and we look forward to delivering for you again in 2023.  With that, I'll hand over to Chris, who will discuss our financial and regulatory items in more detail.\nChristopher Foster: Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned, we delivered our financial commitments this year, landing at $1.10 in EPS for the full year 2022 and completed the year without issuing equity. We're also reaffirming our 2023 to 2026 earnings growth guidance and our commitment to no equity in 2023 or 2024.  This morning, I have a few updates to share with you. To start, I'll recap the drivers of our 2022 financial results and review our 2023 guidance drivers. I'll now provide some updates on how we're delivering against our simple, affordable model. Lastly, I'll provide a few highlights on regulatory, legal and legislative items.  Let's start on Slide 13. As you can see in our full year walk, non-GAAP core earnings were $1.10 per diluted share for the year. We earned $0.07 from our customer capital investments and achieved $0.08 in savings from cost reductions. This allowed us to navigate the ups and downs during the year and deploy resources in our system for customers by pulling forward some work in future years and making other sound financial decisions to deliver right on target for the year.  On Slide 14, as we showed you last quarter, we have planned for substantial customer investment in our 5-year plan, about 1/3 higher than the prior 5 years. We rolled this forward to include 2027. And as shown in orange, we're planning to spend almost 1/2 of our capital in the next 5 years on risk reduction across the enterprise.  This includes system hardening, pipeline replacement and other work critical to reducing risk. We use a risk-based approach to prioritize our capital spend, addressing the highest risk and customer-centric work first.  We are also focused on improving our capital to expense ratio over time. When we were able to do permanent repairs instead of temporary fixes, we improve that ratio and create headroom in the customer bill. This important work in our system also drives earnings per share growth and improves our cash flow from operations.  And as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we've identified over $5 billion of incremental investment opportunity not yet in the plan. We would intend to bring some of this customer-focused spending into the plan as we work to create headroom on the customer bill.  And using our simple, affordable model, we can deliver more risk reduction for every customer dollar spent because of our focus on lean, including waste elimination. Given the substantial capital opportunities in our plan, our pending 2023 General Rate Case and our focus on a return to investment-grade ratings, we intend to continue to show progress on our FFO to debt metric as you've seen on our report card slide. We landed at about 12.5% in 2022, showed some good progress there over where we ended 2021 at 10.9%.  Moving to Slide 15. 2022 came with own set of challenges that we overcame. We saw inflation, rising interest rates, extreme heat, targeted supply chain shortages, natural gas price spikes, an unprecedented range. And yet, we found ways to stay on plan. And as Patti mentioned, the work of the teams to respond to the historic storms late last year and early this year was incredible.  That's why we're so proud of what we are delivering for customers and for you, our investors, using our simple, affordable model. We are laser-focused on affordability and know you are, too. So let's dig a little further into the model.  Through a series of good business decisions and the lean capabilities we're building, we were able to exceed our targeted 2% non-fuel O&M reduction in 2022, delivering a 3% reduction despite inflation. And we use those savings to serve customers and derisk 2023.  We saw significant savings for customers in vegetation management driven by improvements in unit costs due to a few strategic changes. First, we implemented a new accountability model and a consistent pricing structure that supports the integration of work while improving contractor oversight and warranties for rework.  Then we also reduced our contractor counts from 24 to 14, implemented new subcontracting controls and regionalized work to build a stable and predictable plan. This should result in a better customer experience. There were repeat visits and lower cost to deliver for our hometowns while still meeting all our commitments.  Through these efforts, we've saved around $200 million in vegetation management costs in 2022 relative to budget. And we expect to realize over $300 million in cost savings this year while still delivering the units in the base work plan with improved safety and quality.  Also in 2022, we achieved an undergrounding average unit cost per mile, well below the $3.75 million target shared at Investor Day and the baseline of over $4 million from just a few years ago. And there's more opportunity for customers ahead.  As you saw in our report card, our 2% non-fuel O&M savings remains our annual target. We're just getting started finding cost savings for our customers, whether it be through improving our capital to expense ratio, eliminating waste from our processes or working with stakeholders to find better solutions for customers such as our self-insurance settlement.  And as you can see in the 2023 plan column, we are continuing to aggressively pursue efficiencies to deliver our annual 2% non-fuel O&M reduction, which similar to 2022 assumes continued inflationary cost pressures. While our 2% O&M reduction target excludes fuel, I want to take a moment to reflect on the higher bills our customers have been experiencing this winter compared to last winter, largely as a result of higher natural gas prices experienced across the West Coast.  Collectively, during the gas price run-ups in the winter, our procurement team was able to save customers well over $1 billion through a series of thoughtful measures, including a diversified portfolio that includes interstate pipeline capacity reaching back to the supply basins, natural gas storage and financial hedging. To further support our customers, we've been going after bill relief strategies in partnership with federal and state regulators and policymakers.  One example would be supporting the accelerated timing of the annual climate credit, which should put over $90 back in the pockets of our average combination electric and gas customer.  Let's move to the top of Slide 16. As you saw through 2022, we're getting better regulatory and financial outcomes because we're delivering on our operational commitments and serving our customers better every day. Performance is power, and we own our performance.  Our 2022 cost of capital was decided by the CPUC in Q4, leaving our 2022 ROE unchanged. We also received a final decision in our 2023 cost of capital as scheduled, providing further certainty as the 10% ROE approved applies through 2025.  Last month, as requested, the CPUC approved our self-insurance settlement. We appreciate this decision as it allows us to avoid procuring costly wildlife insurance from the commercial insurance markets over at least the next 3 years, saving customers up to $1.8 billion through 2026. We also filed a Track 2 settlement in the GRC, which should help streamline the case procedurally with the schedule calling for a final decision in the third quarter.  Our Pacific Generation application is moving through the CPUC process with a schedule that was released calling for a proposed decision no later than the end of November. While this could mean we don't get a final decision until 2024, we don't see the schedule set forth in the scoping memo, resulting in a meaningful change to our financial plan. We continue to view the sale as an opportunity to efficiently raise needed equity and a solution that benefit customers through realized tax benefits, which accelerate contributions to the customer credit trust.  Moving to wildfire-related cost recovery. In 2022, we were authorized to collect $2.3 billion. The net unresolved balance is now approximately $4.7 billion, and I'm pleased to report additional progress on several cost recovery proceedings.  First, our 2020 WMCE is now final, with those costs moving into rates. Second, we settled our 2021 WMCE resolving all elements apart from the cost in our vegetation management balancing account. Additionally, we filed our 2022 WMCE application and a motion requesting interim rate relief.  Finally, on this slide, we are progressing through the next steps of 2 key pieces of legislation passed in 2022. In November, the Department of Energy confirmed Diablo Canyon is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program and conditionally awarded a total of $1.1 billion.  We view the NRC staff decision last month to require a new application as procedural. And I note that our team has been working on a parallel approach from the outset. NRC staff expect to respond in March to our waiver request, which will allow for continued operation of the units beyond the current operating license expiration date. We're planning to file our new applications with the NRC before the end of this year.  Lastly, 2 notes on our progress on resolving legacy legal claims. First, this week, we filed a joint motion for approval of a settlement reached with the SED resolving their investigation into the Zogg fire. We continue to assert, we were a prudent operator, and we've agreed to forgo cost recovery on $140 million, which will be invested over 3 to 5 years primarily in future system enhancements with a $10 million penalty going to the state general fund.  Second, we've made some modest increases to our wildfire loss accruals for third-party claims this quarter, including $75 million for the Kincade fire, $25 million for the Zogg fire and $25 million for the Dixie fire. I'll remind you that our accrual for the Zogg fire is well within our available insurance. And we continue to book offsetting receivables for the accrual associated with the Dixie fire.  For the Dixie fire, we've reached agreements to settle claims, including with the cities and counties. And we continue to work to fairly resolve individual claims through our fast claims process and mediation.  In all of these cases, we remain committed to continuing to make it right for the communities and customers we serve. California has established legislative and regulatory processes to allow for constructive outcomes where we perform well. We recognize that we have a busy regulatory agenda with the CPUC, and we appreciate the commission's thoughtful consideration as we work relentlessly to achieve our safety and reliability goals as well as advancing California's climate leadership.  Here on Slide 17, I want to take a moment to remind you that we have relatively limited sensitivity to some key variables outside of our control. Part of this is due to constructive California regulation, including decoupling for both gas and electric.  Four elements provide for formulaic commodity recovery with timely cash collection, a 4-year General Rate Case cycle and a 3-year cost of capital cycle. Additionally, we're taking the initiative through our simple, affordable model and our focus on the bill, which we expect to further mitigate financial and regulatory risk as we continue to build trust with our customers, regulators and policymakers.  Moving to Slide 18. We are progressing towards meeting the common stock dividend eligibility threshold later this year. As a reminder, before declaring a dividend, we will first need to report a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11, so starting from the third quarter of 2020.  For this purpose, non-GAAP core earnings means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items specified in our plan of reorganization. And as we step into 2023, we still expect to reach eligibility around midyear. Our plan currently shows us reaching eligibility during the third quarter, although this remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of regulatory decisions. Regarding our eventual policy, I'll remind you that regardless of timing, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start with a small dividend initially, feathering in growth over time.  I'll wrap here by emphasizing that we met our 10% EPS growth target in 2022, no more and no less. And going forward, we continue to reiterate at least 10, 10, 9, 9.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Chris. Let me close by emphasizing we've made a lot of progress in 2022. And yet, we are long away from being done. We have plenty more for you to look forward to in 2023 and beyond as we continue to write the next chapter in the PG&E story.  For our current investors and for those of you still taking a look, we hope you'll consider joining us in California for our 2023 Investor Day on May 24 in the Bay Area followed by undergrounding site visits in and around Napa County on May 25. We're excited to share more details of our longer-term financial plan and our investment opportunities.  We'll roll up our sleeves to show some of our risk reduction tools and technology with you. And we'll also give you the chance to hear about our progress from some of our key California stakeholders. We can't wait to see you.  And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.\nShahriar Pourreza: Just real quick, Patti. In terms of the process and maybe establishing some framework around the Pac Gen equity sale, I mean, obviously, there's been some early stakeholder comments, and the CPUC narrowed down and issues list this year. I guess do you feel there could be an expedited resolution via some form of a settlement, partial settlement to move this process along faster?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, Shar, we -- again, as we've been pretty clear about this, feel like the Pac Gen sale is a really good option for customers. It's a very efficient financing solution.  Expedited might be a little overly ambitious. We know that the commission has a lot of input to take in from stakeholders, and we want to give them the appropriate time to do that review. Though we feel like we've made a really great case, and we feel good about the potential.\nShahriar Pourreza: And then obviously, you guys put out a mid- to high teens credit metric target. Is that -- just remind us, is that inclusive of the Pac Gen equity sale or not?\nChristopher Foster: Shar, that's true. The base plan does include the proceeds from Pac Gen. And as you can imagine, as we kind of more broadly look at the consistent view we've had on mid- to high teens by 2024 on FFO to debt, the real drivers there are probably going to be the GRC.  You've got the wildfire recoveries that we touched on a little bit ago, and obviously, then just underlying CapEx profile as well. So I would think about those as really the drivers behind what we're looking at there for mid- to high teens.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly, Patti, I mean, obviously, one of the key messages for you on this call is like the bill impact is going to be sort of modest, let's just say, right? But some of the offsets and levers that you guys have been able to utilize and plan, which is a really good message. But there's still like, for instance, over $800 million in deferrals that are pending approval right now. I guess how does that kind of play into the equation?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Thanks, Shar. I would say a couple of things. First, there's near-term bill pressure as I think people across the country are feeling with the commodity cost impact and what we're doing there. As Chris mentioned on the call, the state did a really good job, and kudos to the commission for pulling ahead the California climate credit for customers to, in the near term, offset the commodity impact. And we've obviously seen, like others, the commodity cost is back down into more normal range. And that bodes well for customers, and we feel good about that.  But longer term, I think as we think about all of the necessary work for customers, this is why the simple, affordable model here at PG&E is so important. For a long time, we were doing Band-Aid replacements and not doing the permanent corrective climate-resilient infrastructure investments our customers have been asking for.  That's why undergrounding is so important. That's why our capital plan, we've given so much visibility to the capital plan because those investments in our infrastructure enable us to reduce our expense, improve that capital to expense ratio.  Our 3% delivery of our O&M savings this year, that's after inflation that factored in inflation, and then we still deliver 3% on top of that. That's just the beginnings of this team's capability to offset and reduce expenses to make the headroom for the necessary investments in truly climate-resilient infrastructure.  This is a model that is really starting to play out here at PG&E that will benefit customers from both their affordability. And as we layer in those legacy costs then they too will be offset by these cost savings that we're delivering. And so waste elimination is our theme this year, teaching people how to do more for less and really actually making the customer experience better at a lower cost is what the simple, affordable model delivers. And we're excited to be employing it here at PG&E.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.\nSteven Fleishman: So I think you just answered my first question, Patti, which is that the -- when you talk about the O&M costs, net of inflation, you're basically saying those are absolute costs. So even though inflation was up 6%, 7%, 8% last year, your costs were -- your O&M was down 3%.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, Steve. And we're proud of that, and I'm proud of the team for the hard work that they did, and we're just getting started, Steve. That's what's so exciting about this waste elimination and our story of the month about the new business.  There is so much opportunity here, and the team is so hungry to learn. I'm so proud of them. I actually was in our waste -- our new business center just the other day where we're highlighting our waste elimination efforts. And that team was smiling for the first time in a long time, because they're realizing that they can, in fact, have the tools. People need to learn these techniques to actually reduce cost while they're doing more work, and people are really learning fast. I'm super proud of the team.\nSteven Fleishman: Should we think of the waste elimination is like incremental to the O&M costs of 2%? Or that's just part of -- or that's part of achieving the 2%?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, it definitely enables us to deliver that 2% and all the inflationary pressures. So we call it 2%, but it's inflation plus 2%. And so that's what waste elimination delivers. And that, again, as we have ups and downs that come at us, that roller coaster I talk about, this is the capability that we can build into the team to turn on that capacity to reduce waste and absorb inflation and still deliver the 2% plus.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then on the GRC, could you maybe just talk to the schedule for that? And is there likely to be any opportunities to settle either partial provisions of that further like the insurance or the case overall?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. So we've hit the stage where settlement is not really an option at this juncture. We've settled pieces and parts like the insurance because it was so valuable for customers to get that settled early and deploy those savings here in '23.  And so as we follow the timetable that the commission has laid out, we're looking for a proposed decision and final decision in the third quarter. And we know that the commission has a lot on their plate, but we also know that this rate case is really important to customers and our ability to deploy all of the infrastructure investment that we've been talking about for the benefit of customers. So we expect timing to maintain the schedule that the commission has laid out.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then lastly, I just have to ask again, just any color -- new color from the fire victim trustee on just their kind of pace of payments and timing of remaining stock sales?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. No, we haven't really heard anything new. We know that the fire victim's trust is aligned with our interest of delivering safety for customers. As the company succeeds, it enables them to provide for the victims that are included in that trust. And so -- but no new information on timing on that front.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Listen, I wanted to kick it up first on a question related to '27. I know you guys rolled forward the 9.5% rate base CAGR at 2027, held back on commenting on EPS. I know you had this conversation about 10% or 9% in the past. You bifurcated that very clearly. I also appreciate the timeline of the current GRC and what that means for '27. But just asking the question, how do you think about '27 EPS growth and rolling forward the EPS CAGR as well, if you will?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Julien, I think -- how I think about 2027 is the abundant investment opportunity that we have for the benefit of customers. So we've been pretty transparent with our at least 10, at least 10, at least 9, at least 9.  We're going to continue on that EPS growth trajectory, but we need to -- our focus is on developing the best long-term capital investment plan that enables customers to have the infrastructure they've been waiting for and the cost mix by our cost savings that we continue to do that enable that investment without burdening customers too much on that affordability. So our eyes are definitely on a long-term infrastructure investment plan at the lowest cost possible for our customers.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. I would imagine, given the GRC and also, over time, kind of a normalization of the growth trajectories between rate base and EPS, perhaps the bias seems closer to 9 than 10?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, we're just going to have to see, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Fair enough. Fair enough.\nPatricia Poppe: We're obviously thinking a lot mostly about derisking our system physically and making those necessary investments for customers.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Understood. Listen, Patti, actually, since you mentioned this in the prepared remarks on the interconnections and your story, I thought it was very relevant given some of the feedback we're hearing. I'm curious to get your perspectives on what kind of load growth you're seeing. Where are you trending within that 1% to 3%? And can you comment maybe on some pent-up load growth that maybe because of those interconnection delays may not have been realized yet, if you will. But I also appreciate that the transportation electrification figures into that 1% to 3%. But overall, where are you trending against that prospectively, given some of these tailwinds?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. As we've said, we're looking at 1% to 3% load growth over time, more toward the back end of our plan than the front end, but we are seeing low growth. In fact, cut off the presses, Julien, we had 23% of all new vehicle sales in our service area in 2022 were EVs, 23%. I think that's a surprising number. That's up from 16% in 2021. So the EV evolution is definitely happening in California and definitely happening in our service area. In fact, the state was 20% EV penetration. We were 23% in 2022. So all that to say, we are very bullish on the EV role in load growth.  Every EV is like half a house. So in other words, 2 EVs equals a new household in our service area. There is definitely load growth potential. Our forecasts reflect that. And you're right, we have to get really good at building out this capacity for our industrial and residential customers as more fleets electrify, big -- a school bus.  So I was just -- in fact, we just were in one of the electric school buses last week. And that school bus is a megawatt, and Oakland Public Schools is planning to include electric school buses in their fleet. So here we are in our hometown, making sure that they're going to be ready, that's all opportunity for us.  And so as we work with our regulators, making sure that we have a dynamic regulatory environment where we can, in fact, prepare for that capacity investment, be ahead of it is pretty exciting for customers. And so the interconnection, we're continuing to track with that investment, but we see real forecasted growth in the coming years, and that's exciting for us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: I wanted to hit the undergrounding. So you've done about 300 miles now. You have this 10-year plan that's going to be filed soon, but you also kind of changed the GRC. I think there was an intra-quarter update, which might have removed some of the underground in capital.  So I guess, first, can you just kind of comment on -- since you've progressed through this program, are you seeing pressures higher in cost? Or are you seeing efficiencies more from lessons learned? And then second, just how do we kind of think about your ability to hit the goal for roughly 2,000 miles with the shift in the GRC?\nPatricia Poppe: Great question. Of course, we're very excited about our undergrounding plan. And just a couple of good important clarifications for everyone.  Number one, we reduced our mileage as a result of conversations with our key stakeholders. We have to earn the right to do that underground. We have to prove that we can, in fact, do it at the unit cost that we've described.  Happy to report in 2022, the 180 miles we delivered was at a unit cost lower than we had forecasted. So the team is definitely improving on efficiency. And I feel like we're just getting started and really having the scope and scale of program that will consistently deliver the unit costs that we're forecasting.  Our 10-year plan comes out later this year, and that will clarify mileage and unit cost targets. And I also want to remind everyone that, look, this undergrounding program is very important from a risk reduction and a customer satisfaction, but it's not a big bet. The undergrounding program is less than 20% of our total capital plan. It is flexible and dynamic in nature. We're going to be working with our regulators and those stakeholders to make sure that we do undergrounding at a pace that they support.  I remind myself, the Golden Gate Bridge wasn't built in a year. It was built over time, and it's beloved, and that's what our undergrounding program is going to be. It's going to be built over time, and it's going to be beloved. And we have to earn the right to grow those miles year after year after year. And so we're very focused on doing that well. We've got a program structure set up that's delivered real savings in our wildfire mitigation through vegetation management inspections.  The same leadership team is leading the undergrounding program. So we're expecting big things from Peter and the team as they build out our undergrounding program to the benefit of customers. I hope that helps.\nNicholas Campanella: Absolutely. I'm excited to see the plan as it comes together here. So just a quick question on the credit side. Congrats on getting the positive outlook, I guess, from Moody's. What is your understanding, I guess, of what the agencies are looking for now? Is it more time, another fire season to get back to IG here or is it more metrics-based because it does seem like the metrics are going in the right direction.\nChristopher Foster: Sure thing. Nick, I think it's -- in Moody's really reaffirmed this too that our financial metrics as we look at them are really already in that investment-grade territory. So I think really across the agencies, their emphasis is really shared on the physical risk reduction progress we're making.  Patti hit the year-over-year improvements in our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings and just the clear results of that delivers. And then I think also it's the desire to see continued progress and data points with our policymakers.  Last year, we clearly made progress on some key customer-friendly programs, both the undergrounding program and the Diablo Canyon operating life extension in terms of new policy. And I think we just want to continue that progress this year. And that could be across wildfire-related recoveries at the CPUC, certainly our General Rate Case as well as the Pacific Generation filing there at the CPUC as well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to the upside CapEx opportunities, the $5 billion that you laid out in terms of the transmission investment distribution. What could be kind of the timing of getting more concrete numbers around that? When -- could it hit the 5-year plan? Is it potentially kind of elongating the CapEx runway from here? And are there any like milestones that we might track as you evaluate some of those upside opportunities?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Thanks, David. The point in sharing that potential upside is just to share that we have abundant capital infrastructure demand on the system. And so it is truly on us to find ways to offset costs.  Everything that's in the bill that is unrelated to capital investment are areas of the bill that we can reduce in order to enable potential headroom then for that necessary customer benefiting infrastructure investment. So for example, we talked about this insurance settlement. That's a big savings for customers over time.  That would be the sort of thing that creates headroom that we can enable additional capital without pressuring customers' bills. Now we filed a General Rate Case. It's important. That will be an important outcome later this year. That will provide more visibility to exactly what capital we have support from our commission to invest.  And then we're going to continue to demonstrate this waste elimination capacity. So if we start to deliver greater than 2% O&M savings or other savings that enable headroom, that creates the room for capital investment that doesn't pressure customer bills. This is the simple, affordable model in action. And it's dynamic in that way that if we additional -- find additional customer savings, then we'll work with our regulators to approve additional capital to deploy to the benefit of customers.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then I was wondering your fire risk mitigation strategies, they're broad. There are a lot of different components of that. I was wondering if you could speak to innovation that you're working on with regard to fire risk reduction in terms of technologies or new applications that you're exploring right now that could be layered on to the current risk mitigation programs?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, I'm so glad you asked because we're going to be highlighting that at our Investor Day in May, May 24 and 25. We'd love to have you out, and everyone on the call is welcome to join us.  Some of the things that are pretty exciting are our partial voltage detection, which utilizes our smart meter technology for service line risk. We've got our down conductor technology. We're expanding the development of that program. Our teams have had some great breakthroughs in the last year. Kudos to our advanced technology team and all the hard work they've been doing.  And you'll get to see a firsthand when you come out. So lots of innovation and technology, of course, all the data science that underpins our EPSS and our PSPS is really incredible to understand in more detail. And it's what gives us confidence heading throughout the year, whatever the environmental conditions around us, whether it's dry, it's wet, it's hot, it's cold, we're building infrastructure and the capability to adapt to those changing conditions and keep people safe.  And I couldn't be more proud of the team and the progress we've made. We continue to make that progress, and we'll have it on display at our Investor Day here in May. Come on out and see us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Securities.\nRichard Sunderland: It's actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Just one quick follow-up on the $5 billion CapEx upside. Curious a little bit more around those opportunities and what the total bucket of possibilities are. Just really the $5 billion, is it sized for what you think you may be able to fold in over the near to medium term? And is there a larger opportunity set that you're still working through?\nChristopher Foster: Rich, happy to take it. I would take the second part first and say there is a larger opportunity set. But again, as Patti mentioned, keep in mind, our focus is absolutely on that overall simple, affordable model, which includes that affordability constraint for customers, right? So we've always got to keep that in mind as we go.  As we look at the opportunities themselves, I really think that what we were mentioning earlier about the electrification growth is very unique for us. And so as we look at that, the EV penetration opportunity you explicitly see us call out in that $5 billion opportunity capacity-based investments.  And that's really where we see targeted investments that we can make that will benefit the areas where you're seeing not just need for wildfire risk reduction, but also in some of those suburban communities where we're seeing a pretty dramatic EV uptake. So the opportunity there, I would say, do start to come in the medium term and only increase as we go further out.\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. That's very clear. And then just one last one at the risk of, I guess, front running the Analyst Day update. Would that be the forum to address the EPS growth through 2027? I know this was asked earlier.\nChristopher Foster: Sure. I think I'll have to offer this to you. Come on out and see us. We do certainly plan on intending to give you more insight into that longer-term capital plan. But come on out, and we'll be able to share more at that time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gregg Orrill with UBS.\nGregg Orrill: What in the Diablo Canyon extension process should we be watching for in the NRC and state levels?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, first of all, we should be continuing to look for progress because we continue to make progress on that front. The NRC really does have an important job to do, and we don't want them to take any shortcuts. Their focus is on safety and making sure that Diablo Canyon will meet the safety expectations and standards. And so we'll work with them. We have a great relationship with the NRC, and we look forward to working with them on the relicensing process. That's an important part of the process.  There's other several state-based regulatory proceedings that will be occurring. And I will remind everyone, we're -- we want to just send some gratitude and recognition to our state and to our state legislature and our governor for having the wisdom to suggest we extend the life of Diablo Canyon power plant.  That is a high-performing nuclear facility, GHG-free baseload energy to the benefit of all of California. And so we definitely will be working closely with all of the different regulators to make sure that we make positive progress on that. And so that continues throughout the rest of the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: A couple of questions for Patti. How has the hookup cancellation rate changed in the past year? How do you determine which interconnects to prioritize, given limited resources? And then, like in the comments around a new play to the playbook, are you looking at any changes to this process?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, we're looking at changes every day to the process. Look, we've got to be easier to do business with. And I've had a couple of different sessions with our builders here in California. They are a key to California's prosperity. And therefore, we power them and they power California with new housing.  And we're very much aligned with them. We're working with them to find accelerated tools and methods. And it's really amazing to see our new business process map and simple changes that can be made right away so that we don't have to make choices about who we're going to energize and who we're not. The question is about how do we energize people faster and streamline that process.  And so as I shared, that example of these jobs, they get canceled for a variety of reasons, maybe the customer decides they're not going to do their project after all, having nothing to do with us. And we've done the full engineering. So we're looking at ways of doing a lighter engineering touch upfront just to give people the estimate that they need and making sure that we're only doing the engineering on the jobs that are going to get finished.  That's a huge cost savings in hours and dollars. And it enables us to get the work done on time for the builders that are going to finish their projects. And so both capacity and new business are really exciting load growth opportunities for us, and the progress that we've made in a very short order is pretty impressive. We look forward to demonstrating that progress this year and continuing forward.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate the comments. I guess I'm trying to get a sense in terms of quantifying the materiality of some of these delays between when you assumed your currency -- I mean, have you noticed any material changes in how customers have been interconnected or any color you could share around the progress that may be made on a go-forward basis?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. I mean, I think we're seeing increased demand, which is great. There's building happening in California. People are talking about the exodus of California. I can tell you, I'm not feeling it. We're seeing a lot of growth here in customers and capacity. So the -- obviously, the additional electric vehicles that I pointed to is -- requires capacity investments at a substation level, but we also have transmission forecast of additional load. And we're continuing to see the opportunity to build more homes in broader spaces in California.  And we're going to keep up with our building and our progress here at PG&E. And that's what this lean operating system provides for us, the foundation to have visibility into our demand and our ability to eliminate the waste so that we can meet that demand. It's pretty exciting times here at PG&E.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from with Ladenburg Dolman.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. To start with, I was hoping to maybe get a little bit of an update on the Zogg trial. I guess the trial's due to begin in June. How long should we sort of expect before there would be a final decision reached in that proceeding? And in the past, I think you've indicated that the liability estimates could triple. Is that still sort of your view in terms of how much the liability could go up if you were found liable?\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Paul. First of all, on that subject, I just want to reiterate that our heart goes out to the victims of the Zogg fire and all of the wildfires. These environmental disasters are extraordinarily painful, and we don't take them lightly. And we're doing everything we can to make our system safer and faster.  At the same time, I know that my coworkers are not criminals, and we don't believe that these are criminal matters. All that to say, we do -- the trial date has been set for June 6. We expect it to take about 6 weeks. And we don't expect additional liabilities because we actually plan to win.  I think it's important to know that our coworkers, our vegetation management team works day in and day out to make the system safer and faster. And they have no other ambition than to do just that. So we plan to defend our position vigorously.\nUnidentified Analyst: So the trial would take 6 weeks, but the judge issuing a decision could take up to a year after that or...\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, Paul, it's hard to say. We'll obviously keep people posted as that goes.\nUnidentified Analyst: In terms of disallowed interest, can you sort of break out the liabilities or the disallowed rate base items that -- at the utility that go into that calculation?\nChristopher Foster: Paul, it's Chris. I'm happy to work on that with you offline. I can actually give you the bill. As you know, we do a roll-up that's in the appendices of our materials, and I'm happy to spend time with you breaking that out. The undercoverable interest expense, as we noted today, ranges from $370 million to $430 million.\nOperator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Patti Poppe for any additional or closing remarks.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Lisa, and thank you, everyone, for your questions and your support. I just want to remind you all that your investment in PG&E is an investment in California's safety and prosperity, and we thank you for that.  We really appreciate your support. And we are definitely feeling the momentum here at PG&E. We're proud of our performance in 2022, and we're writing the next chapter of our redemption story, and we hope you'll be along for the ride. We look forward to seeing you in California in May, please be safe out there.\nOperator: And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned, we delivered our financial commitments this year, landing at $1.10 in EPS for the full year 2022 and completed the year without issuing equity. We're also reaffirming our 2023 to 2026 earnings growth guidance and our commitment to no equity in 2023 or 2024.  This morning, I have a few updates to share with you. To start, I'll recap the drivers of our 2022 financial results and review our 2023 guidance drivers. I'll now provide some updates on how we're delivering against our simple, affordable model. Lastly, I'll provide a few highlights on regulatory, legal and legislative items.  Let's start on Slide 13. As you can see in our full year walk, non-GAAP core earnings were $1.10 per diluted share for the year. We earned $0.07 from our customer capital investments and achieved $0.08 in savings from cost reductions. This allowed us to navigate the ups and downs during the year and deploy resources in our system for customers by pulling forward some work in future years and making other sound financial decisions to deliver right on target for the year.  On Slide 14, as we showed you last quarter, we have planned for substantial customer investment in our 5-year plan, about 1/3 higher than the prior 5 years. We rolled this forward to include 2027. And as shown in orange, we're planning to spend almost 1/2 of our capital in the next 5 years on risk reduction across the enterprise.  This includes system hardening, pipeline replacement and other work critical to reducing risk. We use a risk-based approach to prioritize our capital spend, addressing the highest risk and customer-centric work first.  We are also focused on improving our capital to expense ratio over time. When we were able to do permanent repairs instead of temporary fixes, we improve that ratio and create headroom in the customer bill. This important work in our system also drives earnings per share growth and improves our cash flow from operations.  And as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we've identified over $5 billion of incremental investment opportunity not yet in the plan. We would intend to bring some of this customer-focused spending into the plan as we work to create headroom on the customer bill.  And using our simple, affordable model, we can deliver more risk reduction for every customer dollar spent because of our focus on lean, including waste elimination. Given the substantial capital opportunities in our plan, our pending 2023 General Rate Case and our focus on a return to investment-grade ratings, we intend to continue to show progress on our FFO to debt metric as you've seen on our report card slide. We landed at about 12.5% in 2022, showed some good progress there over where we ended 2021 at 10.9%.  Moving to Slide 15. 2022 came with own set of challenges that we overcame. We saw inflation, rising interest rates, extreme heat, targeted supply chain shortages, natural gas price spikes, an unprecedented range. And yet, we found ways to stay on plan. And as Patti mentioned, the work of the teams to respond to the historic storms late last year and early this year was incredible.  That's why we're so proud of what we are delivering for customers and for you, our investors, using our simple, affordable model. We are laser-focused on affordability and know you are, too. So let's dig a little further into the model.  Through a series of good business decisions and the lean capabilities we're building, we were able to exceed our targeted 2% non-fuel O&M reduction in 2022, delivering a 3% reduction despite inflation. And we use those savings to serve customers and derisk 2023.  We saw significant savings for customers in vegetation management driven by improvements in unit costs due to a few strategic changes. First, we implemented a new accountability model and a consistent pricing structure that supports the integration of work while improving contractor oversight and warranties for rework.  Then we also reduced our contractor counts from 24 to 14, implemented new subcontracting controls and regionalized work to build a stable and predictable plan. This should result in a better customer experience. There were repeat visits and lower cost to deliver for our hometowns while still meeting all our commitments.  Through these efforts, we've saved around $200 million in vegetation management costs in 2022 relative to budget. And we expect to realize over $300 million in cost savings this year while still delivering the units in the base work plan with improved safety and quality.  Also in 2022, we achieved an undergrounding average unit cost per mile, well below the $3.75 million target shared at Investor Day and the baseline of over $4 million from just a few years ago. And there's more opportunity for customers ahead.  As you saw in our report card, our 2% non-fuel O&M savings remains our annual target. We're just getting started finding cost savings for our customers, whether it be through improving our capital to expense ratio, eliminating waste from our processes or working with stakeholders to find better solutions for customers such as our self-insurance settlement.  And as you can see in the 2023 plan column, we are continuing to aggressively pursue efficiencies to deliver our annual 2% non-fuel O&M reduction, which similar to 2022 assumes continued inflationary cost pressures. While our 2% O&M reduction target excludes fuel, I want to take a moment to reflect on the higher bills our customers have been experiencing this winter compared to last winter, largely as a result of higher natural gas prices experienced across the West Coast.  Collectively, during the gas price run-ups in the winter, our procurement team was able to save customers well over $1 billion through a series of thoughtful measures, including a diversified portfolio that includes interstate pipeline capacity reaching back to the supply basins, natural gas storage and financial hedging. To further support our customers, we've been going after bill relief strategies in partnership with federal and state regulators and policymakers.  One example would be supporting the accelerated timing of the annual climate credit, which should put over $90 back in the pockets of our average combination electric and gas customer.  Let's move to the top of Slide 16. As you saw through 2022, we're getting better regulatory and financial outcomes because we're delivering on our operational commitments and serving our customers better every day. Performance is power, and we own our performance.  Our 2022 cost of capital was decided by the CPUC in Q4, leaving our 2022 ROE unchanged. We also received a final decision in our 2023 cost of capital as scheduled, providing further certainty as the 10% ROE approved applies through 2025.  Last month, as requested, the CPUC approved our self-insurance settlement. We appreciate this decision as it allows us to avoid procuring costly wildlife insurance from the commercial insurance markets over at least the next 3 years, saving customers up to $1.8 billion through 2026. We also filed a Track 2 settlement in the GRC, which should help streamline the case procedurally with the schedule calling for a final decision in the third quarter.  Our Pacific Generation application is moving through the CPUC process with a schedule that was released calling for a proposed decision no later than the end of November. While this could mean we don't get a final decision until 2024, we don't see the schedule set forth in the scoping memo, resulting in a meaningful change to our financial plan. We continue to view the sale as an opportunity to efficiently raise needed equity and a solution that benefit customers through realized tax benefits, which accelerate contributions to the customer credit trust.  Moving to wildfire-related cost recovery. In 2022, we were authorized to collect $2.3 billion. The net unresolved balance is now approximately $4.7 billion, and I'm pleased to report additional progress on several cost recovery proceedings.  First, our 2020 WMCE is now final, with those costs moving into rates. Second, we settled our 2021 WMCE resolving all elements apart from the cost in our vegetation management balancing account. Additionally, we filed our 2022 WMCE application and a motion requesting interim rate relief.  Finally, on this slide, we are progressing through the next steps of 2 key pieces of legislation passed in 2022. In November, the Department of Energy confirmed Diablo Canyon is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program and conditionally awarded a total of $1.1 billion.  We view the NRC staff decision last month to require a new application as procedural. And I note that our team has been working on a parallel approach from the outset. NRC staff expect to respond in March to our waiver request, which will allow for continued operation of the units beyond the current operating license expiration date. We're planning to file our new applications with the NRC before the end of this year.  Lastly, 2 notes on our progress on resolving legacy legal claims. First, this week, we filed a joint motion for approval of a settlement reached with the SED resolving their investigation into the Zogg fire. We continue to assert, we were a prudent operator, and we've agreed to forgo cost recovery on $140 million, which will be invested over 3 to 5 years primarily in future system enhancements with a $10 million penalty going to the state general fund.  Second, we've made some modest increases to our wildfire loss accruals for third-party claims this quarter, including $75 million for the Kincade fire, $25 million for the Zogg fire and $25 million for the Dixie fire. I'll remind you that our accrual for the Zogg fire is well within our available insurance. And we continue to book offsetting receivables for the accrual associated with the Dixie fire.  For the Dixie fire, we've reached agreements to settle claims, including with the cities and counties. And we continue to work to fairly resolve individual claims through our fast claims process and mediation.  In all of these cases, we remain committed to continuing to make it right for the communities and customers we serve. California has established legislative and regulatory processes to allow for constructive outcomes where we perform well. We recognize that we have a busy regulatory agenda with the CPUC, and we appreciate the commission's thoughtful consideration as we work relentlessly to achieve our safety and reliability goals as well as advancing California's climate leadership.  Here on Slide 17, I want to take a moment to remind you that we have relatively limited sensitivity to some key variables outside of our control. Part of this is due to constructive California regulation, including decoupling for both gas and electric.  Four elements provide for formulaic commodity recovery with timely cash collection, a 4-year General Rate Case cycle and a 3-year cost of capital cycle. Additionally, we're taking the initiative through our simple, affordable model and our focus on the bill, which we expect to further mitigate financial and regulatory risk as we continue to build trust with our customers, regulators and policymakers.  Moving to Slide 18. We are progressing towards meeting the common stock dividend eligibility threshold later this year. As a reminder, before declaring a dividend, we will first need to report a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11, so starting from the third quarter of 2020.  For this purpose, non-GAAP core earnings means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items specified in our plan of reorganization. And as we step into 2023, we still expect to reach eligibility around midyear. Our plan currently shows us reaching eligibility during the third quarter, although this remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of regulatory decisions. Regarding our eventual policy, I'll remind you that regardless of timing, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start with a small dividend initially, feathering in growth over time.  I'll wrap here by emphasizing that we met our 10% EPS growth target in 2022, no more and no less. And going forward, we continue to reiterate at least 10, 10, 9, 9.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti. Shar, that's true. The base plan does include the proceeds from Pac Gen. And as you can imagine, as we kind of more broadly look at the consistent view we've had on mid- to high teens by 2024 on FFO to debt, the real drivers there are probably going to be the GRC.  You've got the wildfire recoveries that we touched on a little bit ago, and obviously, then just underlying CapEx profile as well. So I would think about those as really the drivers behind what we're looking at there for mid- to high teens. Sure thing. Nick, I think it's -- in Moody's really reaffirmed this too that our financial metrics as we look at them are really already in that investment-grade territory. So I think really across the agencies, their emphasis is really shared on the physical risk reduction progress we're making.  Patti hit the year-over-year improvements in our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings and just the clear results of that delivers. And then I think also it's the desire to see continued progress and data points with our policymakers.  Last year, we clearly made progress on some key customer-friendly programs, both the undergrounding program and the Diablo Canyon operating life extension in terms of new policy. And I think we just want to continue that progress this year. And that could be across wildfire-related recoveries at the CPUC, certainly our General Rate Case as well as the Pacific Generation filing there at the CPUC as well. Rich, happy to take it. I would take the second part first and say there is a larger opportunity set. But again, as Patti mentioned, keep in mind, our focus is absolutely on that overall simple, affordable model, which includes that affordability constraint for customers, right? So we've always got to keep that in mind as we go.  As we look at the opportunities themselves, I really think that what we were mentioning earlier about the electrification growth is very unique for us. And so as we look at that, the EV penetration opportunity you explicitly see us call out in that $5 billion opportunity capacity-based investments.  And that's really where we see targeted investments that we can make that will benefit the areas where you're seeing not just need for wildfire risk reduction, but also in some of those suburban communities where we're seeing a pretty dramatic EV uptake. So the opportunity there, I would say, do start to come in the medium term and only increase as we go further out. Sure. I think I'll have to offer this to you. Come on out and see us. We do certainly plan on intending to give you more insight into that longer-term capital plan. But come on out, and we'll be able to share more at that time. Paul, it's Chris. I'm happy to work on that with you offline. I can actually give you the bill. As you know, we do a roll-up that's in the appendices of our materials, and I'm happy to spend time with you breaking that out. The undercoverable interest expense, as we noted today, ranges from $370 million to $430 million."

            "name": "Patricia Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on what I know is a busy earnings morning.  As you'll see on Slide 3, this morning, we reported full year 2022 core earnings of $1.10 per share, right on guidance. This was my second year with PG&E with results delivered on plan. No more, no less. As I like to say, we sweat the details so you don't have to.  Our simple, affordable model is designed to maximize work for our customers and deliver on our commitment to you, our investors, each and every year. Our $1.10 EPS for 2022 was up 10% from 2021 as planned. We're also reaffirming our 2023 core EPS guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23, up 10% at the midpoint, along with our previously stated longer-term targets of at least 10% EPS growth in 2024 and at least 9% for '25 and '26.  Also unchanged is our plan for no new equity through 2024. As you know, our sector-leading EPS growth is supported by robust capital investment and ongoing efficiency gains for the benefit of the 16 million Californians we serve. In fact, in 2022, we invested $9.6 billion of capital into our system for the benefit of our customers.  Our system has never been safer, and we continue to make it safer every day. I want to thank you, our investors, for your part in making that possible. The simple, affordable model underpins our confidence in reiterating our financial outlook today despite the very real challenges faced by most businesses in today's inflationary and uncertain economic environment.  Turning to Slide 4. We've made strong progress mitigating physical and financial risk. So here are some high points. On wildfire mitigation, we saw a 99% reduction in acres burned in 2022 relative to the average of the 3 years directly before implementation of Enhanced Powerline Safety Setting.  As we reported last quarter, we were able to successfully navigate extreme summer heat conditions. And in January, our system was put to the test again with an unprecedented series of winter storms, which were met with truly historic levels of performance from the PG&E team.  In addition to addressing physical risks, 2022 was a big year for our financial risk mitigation. We delivered our earnings guidance as well as non-fuel O&M cost reductions of 3% net of inflation. This was ahead of our 2% plan and was achieved in the face of the most challenging inflationary backdrop many of us have seen in our careers.  In our GRC, we added undergrounding while removing vegetation management expense, delivering long-term safety while keeping cost neutral for customers. We closed our $7.5 billion rate-neutral securitization and worked with California policymakers over the summer as they passed constructive legislation supporting our 10-year undergrounding plans and to extend the life of our Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. We view both as beneficial to customers and evidence of the greater trust we are building day in and day out with our stakeholders.  On the regulatory front, we appreciate the CPUC resolving both the 2022 and 2023 cost of capital proceedings last year. And in terms of customer savings, the Net Energy Metering 3.0 decision was a win for customers. We estimate it removes about $1 billion of cost shift through 2030 relative to NEM 2.0.  On Slide 5, we show some highlights on our historic January storm response. I want to emphasize that this story is about more than numbers on a page. This was us delivering for our hometowns, and our coworkers are at their best when put to the test.  During the first 2 weeks of 2023, hit by historic back-to-back to back-to-back atmospheric river storms, our electric team restored over 2.8 million customers through multiple waves of outages, and we had 95% back online within 24 hours during each of those events. January ranked as the top 5 storm in PG&E history and involved the largest contingent of resources we have ever mobilized, including around 7,200 dedicated personnel from 10 states.  The strength and speed of our response also resulted in us seeing improved customer satisfaction scores compared to prior storm-related outages. We've also adopted the standardized emergency management system and Internet command system. And with the support from California's Office of Emergency Services, we've been aligning training of our emergency center staff with our first responder public safety partners. When the time came, our team and an army of partners acted with skill and tenacity, protecting and serving each other and our hometown, and we couldn't be prouder of them.  On Slide 6, I'll recap our layers of protection against wildfire risk, which start with our core system hardening, vegetation management, inspections and repairs. When conditions warned, we supplement these with our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings and our Public Safety Power Shutoffs.  We calculate these layers of protection, including improved situational awareness and coordination with first responders, as delivering over 90% overall wildfire risk reduction. We've already hardened more than 1,200 miles since 2019, and we expect our overall risk reduction to further increase as we pursue our 10,000-mile undergrounding program. In the meantime, we continue to look for innovative new technology solutions such as partial voltage detection and down conductor technology to keep reducing that remaining 10%.  On Slide 7, we take a closer look at our 2022 wildfire risk mitigation performance. Historical data show that from 2012 to 2020, that's before we implemented EPSS, 95% of the acres and 100% of the structures burned were related to ignitions at times when conditions were at R3 or higher. While we were fortunate that 2022 didn't bring significant wind events for the year, there were still 31% more R3 or higher days than in 2018 to 2020. Despite this significant increase, we saw a reduction of 99% in the number of acres impacted by utility ignitions in 2022 over the same time period.  Slide 8 illustrates our simple, affordable model, which includes driving efficiency to make room for customer investment. You've heard us talk a lot about the lean operating system and our 4 basic plays.  In 2023, we're rolling out a fifth play, my personal favorite, waste elimination. And we see this as key to continuing to deliver our plans for both customers and investors.  Our primary constraint is customer affordability, on which we are laser-focused through our newly established bill ownership center led by Carla Peterman. The entire team is looking at the whole customer bill for savings, including energy supply costs, which we know are top of mind.  We have a lot of opportunity to eliminate waste, improve our customers' experience, make our system cleaner and more resilient all the while reducing cost. We can do more for less.  The examples keep piling up. So I felt I needed to bring back my story of the month. So here we go. This month's story is about work we are doing to improve efficiency in our new business area.  Presently, our new customer connections take too long from start to finish. As I recently told a group of California builders, we can, and we will do better. In fact, it's another perfect application for our lean operating system, and specifically, waste elimination.  The team invited our developers and builders to come in and work with us to redesign our processes and share their pain points. We conducted a design thinking workshop. And through rapid prototyping, we can see the path to taking the cycle time down dramatically, improving our ability to both do the hook up on time and in less time. Imagine the rework, the waste, the frustration, the delays we can eliminate.  One challenge is that 64% of the new connection requests we receive today end up being canceled for a variety of reasons. We do too much engineering before we are sure it will even be used. This wastes both time and money, and it also is demoralizing for our talented engineers when much of their work never sees the light of day.  We can dramatically improve how we show up for our new customers. And by doing that, we can free up more time and resources to reinvest back into the system. This is just one of the areas where we are delivering more for customers with every dollar spent. Now that's what I call enabling California's prosperity.  Turning to Slide 9. You may recognize this chart, which shows how we executed in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, we faced headwinds early in the year. Our recovery work then put us ahead of plan. This is all part of the playbook we're running now at PG&E.  We plan conservatively, and we remain nimble, protecting investors from the downside. And when there's upside, we will redeploy it for the benefit of customers, which, in many cases, means pulling work forward and protecting future years. Consistency is the name of the game.  You can see it play out again in 2022. We faced headwinds, including a possible cost of capital reset. We have planned conservatively, though, and we're able to more than offset this and other pressures, allowing us to redeploy again on behalf of our customers and still deliver 10% EPS growth.  Employing the simple, affordable model, we plan to consistently manage the work and deliver our earnings targets, no more and no less. And when we can, we will redeploy favorability in the business on behalf of customers and look to derisk future years with a view to delivering our consistent growth trajectory.  Lots of people say to me, \"Patti, what if this happens or what if that happens?\" This is what we manage at PG&E. Come what may, we have the capability to be nimble and adapt to those challenging and changing conditions. It's a capability that can be taught and learned. As I've said many times, we ride the roller coaster so you don't have to. You can expect to see more of this in 2023 and beyond.  Moving to Slide 10. You can see the progress we made in 2022 as we continue on our journey to build trust with policymakers while creating the stability necessary to attract capital to invest on behalf of customers.  Already, in 2023, we're pleased with the expedited resolution of our self-insurance settlement reached as part of our General Rate Case. This innovative approach enjoys intervenous support and most importantly, can result in up to $1.8 billion of savings for customers over the 4-year GRC period with as much as $300 million expected in 2023.  We also have a number of important catalysts on the horizon. Each of the 4 items you'll see here in blue contain important benefits for our customers and for California. We'll continue to work every day toward timely and constructive outcomes, but we don't do big bets here at PG&E. And I want to remind you that we continue to plan conservatively even as I look forward to seeing more green check marks on this slide.  Turning to Slide 11. Let's take a look at our 2022 report card. While the material fire did not result in any serious injuries and the estimated liability is well within our available insurance, it did cause us to miss our goal of 0 CPUC reportable admissions of 100 acres or more.  We put 180 miles of lines underground last year, exceeding our 175-mile target. And we chose to redirect capital investment to maximize risk reduction during the year, which changed our plans for gas main replacements.  We exceeded our 2% annual O&M cost reduction, offsetting inflation and delivering net savings of 3%. Yes, that is net of inflationary pressure. We see plenty of potential to continue 2% net O&M reduction for many years ahead by working smarter and maximizing value for our customers and investors.  Core EPS came in right on plan at 10%, while we delivered 6% rate base growth in what was the final year of our GRC cycle. Lastly, we were pleased that Moody's recognized our significant progress on mitigating risk and improving relationships in the state when they revised our credit outlook to positive earlier this month.  On Slide 12, we introduced our 2023 report card. One key change is to our headline wildfire metric, where we're sticking with a target of 0 and resulting a new OEIS metric for catastrophic wildfires. This measure lines up with our future wildfire mitigation plans, and we think it's a better one for capturing events that are of real significance from both a customer and investor perspective.  We remain committed to our 10,000-mile undergrounding goal and to achieving our unit cost targets. We'll be filing our 10-year plan later this year with more details.  Our 2% O&M reduction plan shouldn't be a surprise either, and there are no changes to any of our previous financial targets through 2026. We're excited to be adding another year, 2027, to our rate base and CapEx as we look to give you more visibility into our long-term plan.  Our headline 5-year rate base CAGR of 9.5% remains the same, but it's now based off 2022 actuals and runs through 2027. We're feeling really good about what we accomplished in 2022, and we look forward to delivering for you again in 2023.  With that, I'll hand over to Chris, who will discuss our financial and regulatory items in more detail. Thank you, Chris. Let me close by emphasizing we've made a lot of progress in 2022. And yet, we are long away from being done. We have plenty more for you to look forward to in 2023 and beyond as we continue to write the next chapter in the PG&E story.  For our current investors and for those of you still taking a look, we hope you'll consider joining us in California for our 2023 Investor Day on May 24 in the Bay Area followed by undergrounding site visits in and around Napa County on May 25. We're excited to share more details of our longer-term financial plan and our investment opportunities.  We'll roll up our sleeves to show some of our risk reduction tools and technology with you. And we'll also give you the chance to hear about our progress from some of our key California stakeholders. We can't wait to see you.  And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Yes, Shar, we -- again, as we've been pretty clear about this, feel like the Pac Gen sale is a really good option for customers. It's a very efficient financing solution.  Expedited might be a little overly ambitious. We know that the commission has a lot of input to take in from stakeholders, and we want to give them the appropriate time to do that review. Though we feel like we've made a really great case, and we feel good about the potential. Yes. Thanks, Shar. I would say a couple of things. First, there's near-term bill pressure as I think people across the country are feeling with the commodity cost impact and what we're doing there. As Chris mentioned on the call, the state did a really good job, and kudos to the commission for pulling ahead the California climate credit for customers to, in the near term, offset the commodity impact. And we've obviously seen, like others, the commodity cost is back down into more normal range. And that bodes well for customers, and we feel good about that.  But longer term, I think as we think about all of the necessary work for customers, this is why the simple, affordable model here at PG&E is so important. For a long time, we were doing Band-Aid replacements and not doing the permanent corrective climate-resilient infrastructure investments our customers have been asking for.  That's why undergrounding is so important. That's why our capital plan, we've given so much visibility to the capital plan because those investments in our infrastructure enable us to reduce our expense, improve that capital to expense ratio.  Our 3% delivery of our O&M savings this year, that's after inflation that factored in inflation, and then we still deliver 3% on top of that. That's just the beginnings of this team's capability to offset and reduce expenses to make the headroom for the necessary investments in truly climate-resilient infrastructure.  This is a model that is really starting to play out here at PG&E that will benefit customers from both their affordability. And as we layer in those legacy costs then they too will be offset by these cost savings that we're delivering. And so waste elimination is our theme this year, teaching people how to do more for less and really actually making the customer experience better at a lower cost is what the simple, affordable model delivers. And we're excited to be employing it here at PG&E. Yes, Steve. And we're proud of that, and I'm proud of the team for the hard work that they did, and we're just getting started, Steve. That's what's so exciting about this waste elimination and our story of the month about the new business.  There is so much opportunity here, and the team is so hungry to learn. I'm so proud of them. I actually was in our waste -- our new business center just the other day where we're highlighting our waste elimination efforts. And that team was smiling for the first time in a long time, because they're realizing that they can, in fact, have the tools. People need to learn these techniques to actually reduce cost while they're doing more work, and people are really learning fast. I'm super proud of the team. Well, it definitely enables us to deliver that 2% and all the inflationary pressures. So we call it 2%, but it's inflation plus 2%. And so that's what waste elimination delivers. And that, again, as we have ups and downs that come at us, that roller coaster I talk about, this is the capability that we can build into the team to turn on that capacity to reduce waste and absorb inflation and still deliver the 2% plus. Yes. So we've hit the stage where settlement is not really an option at this juncture. We've settled pieces and parts like the insurance because it was so valuable for customers to get that settled early and deploy those savings here in '23.  And so as we follow the timetable that the commission has laid out, we're looking for a proposed decision and final decision in the third quarter. And we know that the commission has a lot on their plate, but we also know that this rate case is really important to customers and our ability to deploy all of the infrastructure investment that we've been talking about for the benefit of customers. So we expect timing to maintain the schedule that the commission has laid out. Yes. No, we haven't really heard anything new. We know that the fire victim's trust is aligned with our interest of delivering safety for customers. As the company succeeds, it enables them to provide for the victims that are included in that trust. And so -- but no new information on timing on that front. Yes. Julien, I think -- how I think about 2027 is the abundant investment opportunity that we have for the benefit of customers. So we've been pretty transparent with our at least 10, at least 10, at least 9, at least 9.  We're going to continue on that EPS growth trajectory, but we need to -- our focus is on developing the best long-term capital investment plan that enables customers to have the infrastructure they've been waiting for and the cost mix by our cost savings that we continue to do that enable that investment without burdening customers too much on that affordability. So our eyes are definitely on a long-term infrastructure investment plan at the lowest cost possible for our customers. Well, we're just going to have to see, Julien. We're obviously thinking a lot mostly about derisking our system physically and making those necessary investments for customers. Yes. As we've said, we're looking at 1% to 3% load growth over time, more toward the back end of our plan than the front end, but we are seeing low growth. In fact, cut off the presses, Julien, we had 23% of all new vehicle sales in our service area in 2022 were EVs, 23%. I think that's a surprising number. That's up from 16% in 2021. So the EV evolution is definitely happening in California and definitely happening in our service area. In fact, the state was 20% EV penetration. We were 23% in 2022. So all that to say, we are very bullish on the EV role in load growth.  Every EV is like half a house. So in other words, 2 EVs equals a new household in our service area. There is definitely load growth potential. Our forecasts reflect that. And you're right, we have to get really good at building out this capacity for our industrial and residential customers as more fleets electrify, big -- a school bus.  So I was just -- in fact, we just were in one of the electric school buses last week. And that school bus is a megawatt, and Oakland Public Schools is planning to include electric school buses in their fleet. So here we are in our hometown, making sure that they're going to be ready, that's all opportunity for us.  And so as we work with our regulators, making sure that we have a dynamic regulatory environment where we can, in fact, prepare for that capacity investment, be ahead of it is pretty exciting for customers. And so the interconnection, we're continuing to track with that investment, but we see real forecasted growth in the coming years, and that's exciting for us. Great question. Of course, we're very excited about our undergrounding plan. And just a couple of good important clarifications for everyone.  Number one, we reduced our mileage as a result of conversations with our key stakeholders. We have to earn the right to do that underground. We have to prove that we can, in fact, do it at the unit cost that we've described.  Happy to report in 2022, the 180 miles we delivered was at a unit cost lower than we had forecasted. So the team is definitely improving on efficiency. And I feel like we're just getting started and really having the scope and scale of program that will consistently deliver the unit costs that we're forecasting.  Our 10-year plan comes out later this year, and that will clarify mileage and unit cost targets. And I also want to remind everyone that, look, this undergrounding program is very important from a risk reduction and a customer satisfaction, but it's not a big bet. The undergrounding program is less than 20% of our total capital plan. It is flexible and dynamic in nature. We're going to be working with our regulators and those stakeholders to make sure that we do undergrounding at a pace that they support.  I remind myself, the Golden Gate Bridge wasn't built in a year. It was built over time, and it's beloved, and that's what our undergrounding program is going to be. It's going to be built over time, and it's going to be beloved. And we have to earn the right to grow those miles year after year after year. And so we're very focused on doing that well. We've got a program structure set up that's delivered real savings in our wildfire mitigation through vegetation management inspections.  The same leadership team is leading the undergrounding program. So we're expecting big things from Peter and the team as they build out our undergrounding program to the benefit of customers. I hope that helps. Yes. Thanks, David. The point in sharing that potential upside is just to share that we have abundant capital infrastructure demand on the system. And so it is truly on us to find ways to offset costs.  Everything that's in the bill that is unrelated to capital investment are areas of the bill that we can reduce in order to enable potential headroom then for that necessary customer benefiting infrastructure investment. So for example, we talked about this insurance settlement. That's a big savings for customers over time.  That would be the sort of thing that creates headroom that we can enable additional capital without pressuring customers' bills. Now we filed a General Rate Case. It's important. That will be an important outcome later this year. That will provide more visibility to exactly what capital we have support from our commission to invest.  And then we're going to continue to demonstrate this waste elimination capacity. So if we start to deliver greater than 2% O&M savings or other savings that enable headroom, that creates the room for capital investment that doesn't pressure customer bills. This is the simple, affordable model in action. And it's dynamic in that way that if we additional -- find additional customer savings, then we'll work with our regulators to approve additional capital to deploy to the benefit of customers. Well, I'm so glad you asked because we're going to be highlighting that at our Investor Day in May, May 24 and 25. We'd love to have you out, and everyone on the call is welcome to join us.  Some of the things that are pretty exciting are our partial voltage detection, which utilizes our smart meter technology for service line risk. We've got our down conductor technology. We're expanding the development of that program. Our teams have had some great breakthroughs in the last year. Kudos to our advanced technology team and all the hard work they've been doing.  And you'll get to see a firsthand when you come out. So lots of innovation and technology, of course, all the data science that underpins our EPSS and our PSPS is really incredible to understand in more detail. And it's what gives us confidence heading throughout the year, whatever the environmental conditions around us, whether it's dry, it's wet, it's hot, it's cold, we're building infrastructure and the capability to adapt to those changing conditions and keep people safe.  And I couldn't be more proud of the team and the progress we've made. We continue to make that progress, and we'll have it on display at our Investor Day here in May. Come on out and see us. Well, first of all, we should be continuing to look for progress because we continue to make progress on that front. The NRC really does have an important job to do, and we don't want them to take any shortcuts. Their focus is on safety and making sure that Diablo Canyon will meet the safety expectations and standards. And so we'll work with them. We have a great relationship with the NRC, and we look forward to working with them on the relicensing process. That's an important part of the process.  There's other several state-based regulatory proceedings that will be occurring. And I will remind everyone, we're -- we want to just send some gratitude and recognition to our state and to our state legislature and our governor for having the wisdom to suggest we extend the life of Diablo Canyon power plant.  That is a high-performing nuclear facility, GHG-free baseload energy to the benefit of all of California. And so we definitely will be working closely with all of the different regulators to make sure that we make positive progress on that. And so that continues throughout the rest of the year. Yes, we're looking at changes every day to the process. Look, we've got to be easier to do business with. And I've had a couple of different sessions with our builders here in California. They are a key to California's prosperity. And therefore, we power them and they power California with new housing.  And we're very much aligned with them. We're working with them to find accelerated tools and methods. And it's really amazing to see our new business process map and simple changes that can be made right away so that we don't have to make choices about who we're going to energize and who we're not. The question is about how do we energize people faster and streamline that process.  And so as I shared, that example of these jobs, they get canceled for a variety of reasons, maybe the customer decides they're not going to do their project after all, having nothing to do with us. And we've done the full engineering. So we're looking at ways of doing a lighter engineering touch upfront just to give people the estimate that they need and making sure that we're only doing the engineering on the jobs that are going to get finished.  That's a huge cost savings in hours and dollars. And it enables us to get the work done on time for the builders that are going to finish their projects. And so both capacity and new business are really exciting load growth opportunities for us, and the progress that we've made in a very short order is pretty impressive. We look forward to demonstrating that progress this year and continuing forward. Yes. I mean, I think we're seeing increased demand, which is great. There's building happening in California. People are talking about the exodus of California. I can tell you, I'm not feeling it. We're seeing a lot of growth here in customers and capacity. So the -- obviously, the additional electric vehicles that I pointed to is -- requires capacity investments at a substation level, but we also have transmission forecast of additional load. And we're continuing to see the opportunity to build more homes in broader spaces in California.  And we're going to keep up with our building and our progress here at PG&E. And that's what this lean operating system provides for us, the foundation to have visibility into our demand and our ability to eliminate the waste so that we can meet that demand. It's pretty exciting times here at PG&E. Thank you, Paul. First of all, on that subject, I just want to reiterate that our heart goes out to the victims of the Zogg fire and all of the wildfires. These environmental disasters are extraordinarily painful, and we don't take them lightly. And we're doing everything we can to make our system safer and faster.  At the same time, I know that my coworkers are not criminals, and we don't believe that these are criminal matters. All that to say, we do -- the trial date has been set for June 6. We expect it to take about 6 weeks. And we don't expect additional liabilities because we actually plan to win.  I think it's important to know that our coworkers, our vegetation management team works day in and day out to make the system safer and faster. And they have no other ambition than to do just that. So we plan to defend our position vigorously. Yes, Paul, it's hard to say. We'll obviously keep people posted as that goes. Thank you, Lisa, and thank you, everyone, for your questions and your support. I just want to remind you all that your investment in PG&E is an investment in California's safety and prosperity, and we thank you for that.  We really appreciate your support. And we are definitely feeling the momentum here at PG&E. We're proud of our performance in 2022, and we're writing the next chapter of our redemption story, and we hope you'll be along for the ride. We look forward to seeing you in California in May, please be safe out there."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to PG&E Corporation's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Fallon, Director -- Senior Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Fallon, you may now begin.\nMatthew Fallon: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for PG&E's third quarter earnings call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's third quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures. The presentation can be found online, along with other information at investor.pgecorp.com. We encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. With that, I'll hand it to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you can see on Slide 3, we are on track to deliver our commitments to you. We've narrowed our non-GAAP core EPS range for 2022, to $1.09 to $1.11 per share. As Chris will discuss, we performed well in the third quarter, providing room to reinvest for our customers in the fourth quarter and deliver at the midpoint of our non-GAAP core EPS guidance. No more, no less. In addition, we're initiating 2023 non-GAAP core EPS guidance. You probably won't be surprised, 2023 is in line with our projected 10% growth in a band of $1.19 to $1.23. We're also reiterating our at least 10% EPS growth for 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. No change there. As you know, to fund growing important capital investment for our customers, we've been working on more efficient financing plans like the minority interest sale Pacific Generation. We've been working on plans like this for some time within our five-year planning process. As a result, we're happy to report that we forecast no equity issuance for the remainder of this year, nor in 2023 nor in 2024. There will undoubtedly be ups and downs in that time frame as we continue to resolve legacy legal matters and regulatory investigations and proceedings. We want you to know that we work hard to provide flexibility for the unknowns with an eye toward maximizing the resources available to serve the needs of our customers. Our goal is to be proactive, handle the ups and downs so that you don't have to. Our priority will always be to deliver the highest value investments for customers and deliver consistent financial results for you, our investors. Your capital is essential to our ability to make our system safer, faster and to deliver for our customers. Moving to Slide 4. We continue to be focused on Mitigating Physical Risk and Mitigating Financial Risk. I want to highlight a couple of major accomplishments for the team during the third quarter. First, we experienced a historic 10-day heat wave starting in late August, with all-time record high temperatures and all-time demand on September 6, PG&E and the people of California rose to the challenge. We avoided rotating power outages and we restored 97% of impacted customers within 12 hours. This response is a wonderful example of the PG&E team in action, partnering with the state, our fellow utilities, the California ISO and our customers, mitigating physical risk for our hometowns. Second, this quarter, on our vegetation management, our efforts since 2021 are recognized in the CPUC draft resolution recommending us to exit Step 1 of enhanced oversight. You may remember that we entered into this additional regulatory oversight as a result of our evolving vegetation management program and inconsistent risk model application in 2020. Our customers have benefited from the constructive feedback of our regulators, and we thank them for their transparency and engaging oversight. Another highlight of the quarter came as a result of the policymakers of California working hard through the legislative session to enable us to better serve our customers by passing two historic legislative packages, one for Undergrounding and another to support the extension of our Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant. As I mentioned, we continue our focus on mitigating financial risk for our customers through our simple, affordable model and mitigating financial risk for our investors by delivering consistent, predictable results and a stronger balance sheet. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to add layers of protection that we estimate have mitigated 90-plus percent of the wildfire risk on our system today. Our layers start with our Wildfire Mitigation Programs such as system hardening and Undergrounding, vegetation management and enhanced inspections and repairs. We leverage Enhanced Power Line Safety Setting Technology and our Public Safety Power Shutoff tools to keep people safe when conditions require it. We extend that protection by engaging with first responders when an ignition does occur to make sure that we are using our collective knowledge and experience to minimize the impact of fire spread. And of course, we continue to evaluate innovative solutions to move above the 90-plus percent wildfire risk reduction with a specific focus on low energy faults, which are typically not currently mitigated by EPSS. To address these faults, we're using partial voltage force out and downed conductor detection capabilities. We've implemented partial voltage detection through our smart meters across the high fire risk areas and we've had 33 partial voltage force out since the program initiation in June, with 10 potential hazards identified that could have led to potential ignition. For downed conductor detection, we've installed protection on over 5,000 miles of our overhead electric distribution lines in the high fire risk areas, and we've experienced nine downed conductor detection outages to date, any one of which could have led to a potential ignition. We'll continue to innovate and push to further increase our wildfire mitigation above the estimated 90-plus percent in place today. Here on Slide 6. You'll see our systematic approach that enables our 90-plus percent wildfire risk mitigation today. We've implemented our enhanced power line safety settings across 43,000 miles of high fire risk areas and select adjacent areas. With this systematic approach in place in 2022, we've seen a meaningful reduction in both the number of ignitions and size of fires when ignitions do occur. While ignition count alone is a primary indicator of wildfire risk, not all ignitions are the same in terms of consequence, which is why we've developed this new metric, the Ignition Impact Measure. It's simply the sum of acres burned by CPUC reportable ignitions on primary distribution assets in high fire risk areas. This measure proves to us that EPSS works. Due to our efforts in 2022, despite 36% more R3 risk days in 2022 relative to the 2018 through 2020 average, we've seen a 99% reduction in the ignition impact measure. Turning to Slide 7. We're committed to earning trust with policymakers in California, utilizing the simple, affordable model. The legislation on Undergrounding and the Diablo Canyon extension fit right into the simple affordable model, reducing financial risk by delivering safe, reliable, clean energy affordably to our customers. The benefits of the Undergrounding and Diablo Canyon extension bills are shown here on Slide 8. For Undergrounding, the major benefit versus the prior construct is the longer-term work plan, which leads to real cost savings for customers. The new law allows us to provide certainty to our workforce, create longer-term partnerships for material and equipment and inform our home counts about when they will benefit from their lines being buried. This long-term certainty is critical to accelerate permanent risk reduction of physical and financial risk for our customers. For the Diablo Canyon Power Plant extension, the new law is a key step to allow us to provide California with a large source of non-GHG emitting baseload power for another five years. The alternative would have been for us and other load-serving entities in California to procure more expensive baseload clean power to replace what is today over 8% of all of California's energy consumed, provided annually by Diablo Canyon. Replacing this power has proven challenging given clean energy supply constraints, and we estimate that this law will save customers several hundred million dollars relative to other potential baseload solutions. In addition to clean energy that provides savings to California electric customers, extending Diablo Canyon provides local jobs to over 1,000 PG&E coworkers and is a big boost to local businesses and the Central Coast economy. Moving to Slide 9. We are early on our journey with policymakers, earning trust and establishing the stability necessary to attract capital to invest on behalf of our customers. It started in 2019 with the passage of AB 1054. AB 1054 provides a framework to keep California utilities financially healthy while we do the work necessary to mitigate wildfire risk. Building on the AB 1054 Foundation, the two pieces of legislation passed in 2022 create the right outcomes for customers, mitigating physical risk and financial risk further enhancing the California regulatory construct. Looking ahead to 2023, we'll file our 10-year Undergrounding plan, informed by feedback we received from our various stakeholders and we've proposed to finalize our potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation, an example of our continuous effort on efficient financing. Earning trust also requires that we fulfill our regulatory requirements and meet our standards. When we identify a shortcoming, we own that outcome, communicate transparently and take appropriate corrective actions. This week, we're doing just that. We filed a self-report with the CPUC for a pole inspection standard gap that was identified by a team of my coworkers. Our standard did not match the CPUC standard. We found it and are on track to remediate all of the highest risk polls in question by the end of the week. I've talked a lot about how we're using Lean here at PG&E. Our performance playbook is empowering our workforce and enabling us to make gaps to standards visible and allowing us to close the gaps, making us a better operator. This is an essential part of the turnaround and culture change here at PG&E. We need to have the will to change and the skills to execute. Our performance playbook enables both. Closing on Slide 10, our report card slide. You can see here how we're tracking on our goals for 2022 and beyond. We added the mosquito fire to our CPUC reportable ignitions greater than or equal to 100 acres. Though the investigation is not complete, we can see that the fire started near the base of our 60 kV steel pole. As Chris will discuss, we booked a liability for the mosquito fire of $100 million, which is well within our range of insurance. We will miss our gas main miles replacement as we reallocated some funding to other higher risk capital spend this year. This is a good example of our Lean operating system, making visible the best choices for our customers. We are comfortable making that visible to you too. You may also notice that we increased our annual rate base growth from 9% to 9.5% through 2026. Our customers expect us to make the right infrastructure investments and this investment reflects that. We will continue to do that and manage the affordability with our simple model. The other metrics are all on track, and we feel great about our progress. With that, I'll hand it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial and regulatory items.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned, we remain focused on delivering our financial commitments this year and we are reaffirming the five-year plan with our 2022 to 2026 earnings growth guidance remaining the same. This morning, I have a few updates to share with you. To start, I'll recap our third quarter financial results. Then I'll walk you through the details of our 2023 guidance. And lastly, I'll provide a few highlights on regulatory and legislative items. Let's start on Slide 11. With non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter coming in at $0.29, and at $0.84 for the first nine months, we're solidly on track to deliver the midpoint of our narrowed 2022 non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.10. As Patti mentioned, we took a charge of $100 million for the mosquito fire this quarter, an estimated impact that is well within our available $940 million wildfire insurance and does not factor into our walk here. We expect applicable self-insurance for this fire to be recoverable in CPUC and FERC grades. Earlier this week, the CPUC issued a proposed administrative enforcement order related to the 2020 dog fire. The proposed order recommends a penalty of $155 million. We'll look to work with the CPUC to resolve the issues identified in the proposed order as we have with other CPUC enforcement actions. While we're showing strong results year-to-date in 2022, some of the benefit is timing related and some of the benefit reflects conservative planning. But because of these efforts, we'll invest back into the system as part of maximizing every available resource for our customers and meet our commitments to you. As Patti referenced, our active efforts during the year have also allowed us to eliminate equity needs for 2022. Turning to Slide 12. With 2022 nearly complete, we're initiating 2023 guidance, consistent with our existing five-year guidance and reflective of our abundant customer safety and reliability capital investment opportunities, our 2023 non-GAAP core EPS guidance is up 10% from our 2022 midpoint at $1.21. It's reflected here within a tight range of $1.19 to $1.23. On the financing front, at the operating company, we expect to issue net long-term debt through 2023, largely in line with our planned CapEx less depreciation and our improved capital structure. An important part of our financing plan is the sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation filed with the CPUC last month. This proposed transaction would allow customers to retain the benefits of our flexible and clean generation portfolio with no bill impact while providing a source of funding to be invested in the system for their benefit. Our plan to utilize efficient financing from the proposed minority interest sale, along with moderating our parent debt paydown, result in us projecting no equity issuance in 2023 or 2024. I want to reinforce that customer affordability remains at the forefront of all our decision-making as we turn to Slide 13. Moderating customer bill growth to at or below inflation is our guidepost. And the simple affordable model is how we will get there. Our proposed minority interest sale fits squarely into the efficient financing category shown here, with proceeds providing an alternative to equity issuance. As this transaction moves through the regulatory approval process with the proposed transaction close date in Q4 2023, we are not slowing down our pursuit of additional O&M cost reductions. Our annual 2% nonfuel O&M cost reduction target remains another key aspect of our simple affordable model. And we're making additional progress on this front in our 2023 general rate case which takes us to my last topic, our key regulatory and legislative updates. Starting at the top of Slide 14. We received a proposed decision in an alternate proposed decision in our 2022 Cost of Capital proceeding. Both the proposed decision and the alternate acknowledges an extraordinary event occurred and that no automatic adjustment mechanism should be implemented. The proposed decision calls for a second phase to determine the appropriate ROE for 2022, while the ultimate call for the ROE to remain at 10.25%. In the 2023 Cost of Capital case, we expect to see a proposed decision in November, which will allow for a final decision before the end of the year. Moving to the 2023 General Rate Case. This month, we filed a settlement agreement that provides for 100% wildfire liability self-insurance. This is a great outcome for customers with the potential for up to $1.8 billion in savings over the 2023 to 2026 GRC period, and here's how it works. If approved, the settlement allows for self-insurance to be funded through CPUC jurisdictional rates starting at $400 million for test year 2023 and subsequent years into $1 billion of unimpaired self-insurance is reached. Given the high cost of wildfire insurance, this was a priority for PG&E, TURN and CAL advocates, and we'd like to thank the parties for working collaboratively on a constructive outcome for customers. We're asking for a final decision by February 2023, so we can lock in the self-insurance option for the 2023 policy year. The remainder of the 2023 general rate case continues to move through the process, with the final decision scheduled for the third quarter of 2023. Moving down the slide, we've next summarized the status on our outstanding recoveries related to wildfire risk reduction investments. We have approximately $5.7 billion outstanding at the end of the quarter. Of this amount, approximately $800 million has already been approved for cost recovery through 2023, and we anticipate an additional roughly $1 billion in additional recoveries in 2023 overall. This month, the CPUC issued both a proposed decision and an alternate proposed decision on our 2020 wildfire mitigation and catastrophic events application. While we're glad to see the movement in this case, we're disappointed with the proposed decision both of which declined to adopt our settlement agreement in full, and we will be advocating for improvements. At the bottom of this slide, we highlight two important pieces of legislation signed by the Governor last month. SB 884 provides support for a 10-year Undergrounding plan, which we'll file in 2023. And SB 846 provides for the five-year extension of Diablo Canyon, which as Patti discussed, is a great outcome for our customers and our coworkers. I'll close on Slide 15 by reiterating that we are on track to deliver our 2022 financial targets, on plan to deliver predictable results and mitigate financial risk. Our five-year commitment remains unchanged. Non-GAAP core EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Chris. As I wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to take a moment to thank Matt Fallon for his dedicated service to PG&E during a very difficult time. We wish Matt, our very best, and I know you do, too. By mitigating physical and financial risk for our customers and investors, we continue on our path toward making PG&E a premium utility, and we've made tremendous progress in 2022. We know we are rebuilding this utility in a way that can last. We are turning the page on our history, focused on the new PG&E story. We trust that you feel the momentum too. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey guys. Good morning.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning, Shahriar.\nShahriar Pourreza: Good morning. So just maybe starting off with the new 9.5% rate base CAGR you put out there. I guess, what are some of the moving pieces that caused you to tick up by that 50 bps? Is it just confidence around the prior range that was provided by Undergrounding? Is it some of the investment opportunities from Diablo Canyon baseline CapEx up? Is it all the above? And I guess, can you just help bridge the driver of that increase? And is there any near-term opportunities that could further be incremental to that plan? Thanks.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Great question, Shahriar. Look, one thing that I have definitely learned is that we have a lot of work to do here at PG&E. And one thing that's been really interesting to watch is our new business applications. We have over 120,000 applications for new business in a given year. And so as we're always looking to allocate capital and making sure we're serving all of our regions appropriately and making sure we have the best service for our customers, regardless where they live in our service area, we knew that we needed to really make sure that we had enough capital deployed to make -- to serve that new business and certainly, the additional electrification that we're starting to see and our electric vehicle count continues to grow. And so capacity and new business will be a primary use. But as you can imagine, we do a lot of work on capital allocation and making sure that we can serve all of our regions well.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just Patti, looking at sort of your early outlook for financing, you guys reduced equity to 24 down to 0 and now you're targeting about $2 billion more in debt paydown. I guess what are some of the moving pieces and being able to get the offset? And just to confirm, you're now embedding the proposed equity sale of Pacific Generation. What are you assuming there since this process is, I guess, in more infancy stages still? Thanks.\nChris Foster: Hey, Shahriar, good morning. So I think, say, there's a couple of things moving around, obviously. But I think maybe the place to start is what are we solving for. I think Patti really hit it earlier, which is we've got substantial capital needs for the system. We're balancing that with going forward with the best economic decisions we can make on the financing itself. That's why you heard us say moderating at the holdco debt paydown, eliminating equity needs for '23 and '24 and we're going to continue to target that mid to high-teens FFO to debt guide through the plan. So that hasn't changed. So really, we're constantly managing the ups and downs. A couple of the examples to think about even in the last couple of years. Our San Francisco general office sale, the towers related lease transaction, and now we've got the Pacific Generation transaction as well. It is embedded in the plan, Shahriar? We've got a current assumption for a year-end 2023 resolution at the CPUC. But obviously, we're going to be managing conservatively there around timing. So hopefully, that helps paint the moving pieces for you a bit.\nShahriar Pourreza: No it does. Fantastic. I'll jump back in the queue. So you guys [indiscernible] and congrats Mr. Fallon. Thanks guys. Bye.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks Shahriar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes, hi good morning. Thanks So great to see some of this progress and also great to see it getting reflected in the stock price recently, but obviously begs the question, just is there any color on the Fire Victim trust and how they're thinking about things now that the stock looks like it might actually be above where they got it at?\nChris Foster: Sure, Steve. As you can imagine, we remain in continuous contact with the Fire Victim trust as given they are a large shareholder of the company. But at this point, it's definitely a very explicit decision in terms of execution of any kind of financing. Most recently, certainly, all of the saw in the market, roughly 35 million shares, just over, I think, about a month ago. So at this point, as you can imagine, it's tough for us to predict any future explicit transaction there.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Good. And then just on the minority sale and looking at your rate base, is that -- is the rate base associated with that potential sale included in your rate base still? Could you just remind us how much that would be?\nChris Foster: Sure, Steve. I think it's very limited is the way to think about it. You'd look at it and probably see about $0.03 total change. But that's in terms of our overall plan, that's pretty easy for us to manage here over that time frame. So really for us, it's about the efficient financing that this opportunity provides which is why this is really about the focus here over the next couple of years.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. But it's still in the rate base data. So we just make that adjustment once we see something that's not like pulled out already of the rate base?\nChris Foster: That's correct. We'll be not explicitly pull it out. Yes, thanks for the clarifying question.\nSteven Fleishman: And then last question is just in terms of the overall financing environment and I guess combining with kind of IRA impacts. Could you just talk to whether the kind of higher cost financing environment and IRA and all those things are kind of embedded in this kind of refresh plan. Is there anything we need to be watching? Yes.\nChris Foster: Yes, they definitely are embedded. In fact, we were able to update our general rate case here recently, which really showcased the next four years of IRA impacts. So really, you could see that no material impacts in terms of the overall plan itself in the five year plan. What I would offer is kind of two different points. So one, the customer benefits that can come here from the IRAs passenger substantial. We're talking probably over $0.5 billion over the next 10 years, just purely in customer savings from reduced pricing on the renewable energy contracts and PPAs that we pursue. Then in the near term, as we look at interest rate pressure, we've already assumed that rates continue to go up. And just as a reminder for us, in terms of a rule of thumb, you can probably look at a 100 basis point move for the company's up or down is roughly $0.02 up or down. So we've already managed roughly $60 million in impacts this year and are comfortable, again, managing that going forward.\nSteven Fleishman: Great. Thanks for the updates.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time and congratulations on the continued success here really, really impressive. Just if I can clarifying a couple of things thus far. Your '23 outlook here. I mean, given the step-up in rate base, one might have thought there might have been a bigger jump in earnings here. Can you elaborate a little bit on the moving pieces here? Clearly, the front-end impact of a sale here of rate base, you said $0.03 a moment ago. What would be one of potentially a plurality of items here. But can you talk about it outside of just the conservatism in your plan? About the bigger step up in rate base versus earnings? And then separately, I'm just showing a quick second question at the same time. The '25 and '26 bio mission, are you saying that there's still kind of an equity balance sheet?\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Julien. A couple of things. First, as you know, we do plan conservatively, and that's how we can be confident in our forward-looking equity forecast as well as our -- in equity guidance as well as our earnings guidance. Our goal is to ride those ups and downs. And we still, as I mentioned, we'll see legacy items. We'll see items of opportunity, and we'll see items that we can invest back in the business. It is always going to be number one for us to be balancing affordability with quality of service. And so that's -- those are the trade-offs and the precision that we balance against. And so that's what drives our earnings forecast. We think that added 10% EPS growth, we feel good about that, and we feel good that we can consistently deliver, and that's what is most important to us and to our customers. And I think that's how we best serve investors as well.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. On '25 and '26, there? Maybe a Chris question.\nChris Foster: Sure, Julien. I was just getting ready to jump in. Good morning. I think that as we look at the timing really around the Alpine -- excuse me, around the Pacific Generation sale. At this point, you can imagine we'll be getting greater certainty as we go into next year. We've got a midyear time frame of an initial view from the CPUC at least in what we've requested. And so once we can get further along there, I think once we also look at our dividend reinstatement, right? We're going to be able to give a better view on equity as we go out to '25 and '26. Certainly, at this point, just too early.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. No, you give some. We want more right always.\nPatricia Poppe: We know Julien. We know. We're just keeping it on the straight and narrow here. Thank you.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Indeed, congratulations and nice [indiscernible] Patti on bringing the conservatism back into the plan that we know you for.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Julien.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Lapides: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Actually I have three. I apologize for three questions. I'll just rattle them off. I think two are probably for Chris, one for Patti. The two for Chris. Just curious, as you think out a few years, how much in the way of holding company debt do you want to keep up top? That's question one. Question two is, can you remind us what your cash tax position will be post-IRA and whether that impacts the level of cash taxes going forward? And then Patti, for you. Labor availability. I know labor rates for -- and I'm thinking a lot in aircraft and folks who work on the system. I know labor rates are up a lot, especially in your region. But are you seeing any challenges in the actual availability regardless of costs?\nPatricia Poppe: Okay. Chris, why don't you take the first two, and then I'll take number three.\nChris Foster: Sure, happy to. Michael, it's here on the first one in terms of holdco debt. Again, as a reminder, we've got $4.75 billion in holdco debt at this point. And what we updated this morning is, as we're looking through the plan from now through 2026, we'd anticipate reducing that over $2 billion. So the $2 billion plus number that what we provided this morning. On cash taxes, at this stage, we were -- again, pretty specific in terms of our filing in terms of our general rate case specifically there. It's tough for me to be much more specific on cash taxes other than to say what we experienced in the five-year plan was really a generally offsetting impact from the corporate minimum tax and then the depreciation provisions that were embedded there. So really no material impact in the plan in the near term.\nPatricia Poppe: And then I'll go on to question three on the labor availability. Michael, it's a great question. And I'm really -- I just need to give a shout out to our labor partners, the ESC and the IBW have been extraordinary partners for us as we've been really turning around the company. And just one example, we felt like we were -- we could do a better job serving the Bay Area, specifically San Francisco and the City of Oakland, and we had a challenge staffing those communities. And we worked with our union. And in fact, we challenged ourselves to add a 100 new line workers for the city of San Francisco and Oakland. And we weren't sure we would be able to find those resources. And in fact, we have. And the beauty of that is, as we hired those line workers to work here at PG&E, we were able to actually save money because we were paying premiums for contractors and we ended up saving over $8 million by in-sourcing 100 new line workers. So it's really an incredible opportunity to work with our labor unions. People want to work at PG&E and we're able to attract that talent.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thanks Patti. Thanks Chris. Much appreciated.\nChris Foster: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse Financial Services. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey good morning everyone. I dropped, so hopefully, I'm not repeating a question here. But I guess just since you kind of announced this minority interest sale and the strategy around Pacific Generation, have you had incomings of interest on the assets? And can you give us any kind of detail on how those conversations have been? And just overall interest in the assets would be helpful.\nChris Foster: Hi, Nick, absolutely no. Thanks for the question. I know it's a busy morning. This hasn't been asked. So happy to give you color in lease in what we can. Again, the portfolio itself is one that is very clean, right? We're talking about 5.6 gigawatts with 75% of it plus is completely GHG free and a very straightforward predictable regulatory environment for these assets themselves. So because of that, certainly have had interest in the assets themselves. But let me maybe help give you some color on timing, right, and the time frame we're looking at. We have already filed the request of the CPUC for the ability to create the subsidiary at the utility. So the way I would think about this in terms of our timing, we'll be in that marketing process with counterparties in Q1 next year. So it's a little premature for me to give a whole lot of color other than to say definitely inbounds, definitely have had interest. But we want to make a little bit more progress first here on the underlying case itself before we get into those detailed diligence discussions.\nNicholas Campanella: Got it. That's helpful. That's helpful. And then just on the credit side, a lot of positive data points across the board this year. The credit rate neutral securitization and you seem to be on the path to achieve the FFO to debt targets that you've wined out. Just what are the conversations with the agency has been? How should we just kind of think about timing to get back to investment grade at the holdco? Thanks.\nChris Foster: Sure. Very focused there, Nick, as you can imagine. It's really two things for us. It's -- first, it's the quantitative measures, consistently focused there on FFO to debt, as we've talked about and we think that trajectory of mid to high teens puts us on that path to continue to walk up beyond the positive outlooks that we recently saw. Additionally, I think it's really important, some of the highlights that we were able to provide this morning show progress on the qualitative component. Patti really hit in detail the progress we're making with 99% risk reduction as it relates to our EPSS protocols. That's the essence of the improvements we need to be able to show operationally. Additionally, the final key piece is consistent, timely straightforward regulatory outcomes. And I think that that's what we're starting to see. We showcased both on the legislative and the regulatory side progress being made. On the legislative side with the Diablo Canyon legislation as well as Undergrounding. And then it's up to us to now file next year a comprehensive 10-year undergrounding plan and really execute that work effectively. Similarly on the regulatory side, I think that we've got right in front of us here, cost of capital-related decisions are going to be important to showing the rating agencies progress on, again, both quantitative, in terms of the FFO to debt, and then qualitative on both operational and regulatory efforts that are underway.\nNicholas Campanella: All right. Thanks so much team and Matt. Pleasure working with you.\nChris Foster: Thanks Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGregg Orrill: Yes, thank you. Good morning.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning, Gregg.\nGregg Orrill: So as you get to the point where you're tapping the wildfire fund. Can you please sort of remind me of the process there and the timeline? And if there's any sort of review around that and how you think about it?\nChris Foster: Sure. Hi Gregg. I think there's a few steps that I can lay out there for you. So specifically, this would relate to the charges we've taken on the Dixie Fire, where the implication would be a roughly -- very small, but a roughly $150 million impact to the wildfire fund. So the way to think about this is -- we'll work our way through now with various legal claims themselves. Traditionally, takes -- you really don't get your arms around really the totality of the legal claims for roughly two to three years. Then we embark upon settlement and resolution or litigation of those claims. At that stage, you then move forward with a review at the CPUC of roughly 12 to 18 months, right? So you've got three years, then you add another 18 months for our filing related to prudency under the new AB 1054 improved construct. Only after that, once we've resolved and I believe the wording in the law is substantially resolved, most of the claims only then would you be knocking on the door of the wildfire fund for those recoveries. And so as you've seen at this stage in terms of our both -- the charge we took and the offsetting receivables, we are confident at this point that in terms of our actions at that location as a prudent operator to be able to have both recoveries above insurance at the CPUC and FERC as well as recoveries at the wildfire fund, but it will be a few years ahead of us.\nGregg Orrill: Okay. Thank you. And then the realization of the tax benefits related to the Fire Victims Trust sales. What's the timing of how that comes through? How does that work?\nChris Foster: So we recognize -- thank you, Gregg. We do recognize those tax benefits. You'd see those on a quarterly basis as we update each quarter because any time there is a sale, both the Fire Victim Trust enjoys the tax benefit as well as the company. So we would -- you would see that updated as the three sales have happened this year directly into our financials in the subsequent quarter.\nGregg Orrill: Thanks very much. Congratulations.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Gregg.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks Gregg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Arcaro: Hi, good morning team. Thanks so much for taking my question.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning, David.\nDavid Arcaro: I was wondering if you could speak to the GRC. There was your recent update related to inflation had a fairly significant impact on just the higher rate base level that's getting requested there. Wondering if you could just give a sense of -- are those inflation numbers they were fairly mechanical, so are they real? How are you interpreting them in terms of the costs of the business for the next couple of years? And how might the commission interpret those inflation adjustments that were made?\nPatricia Poppe: It's a great question. We definitely are seeing inflation in our actual spend. We see that. But I think what's really important to think about as we look at our filings and our GRC and the inflation update, is our commitment to affordability for customers. And so as we look at the -- our bills here in California, we do have the benefit of mild weather in most parts of our state. And so that's one piece of the puzzle here that we're aware of that our energy bills are a lower percent of wallet than in many parts of the country. However, there are parts of our state where they are more energy intensive. And so we have a very important focus on affordability, and that's what the simple affordable model is all about. We know that our customers have been really anxious for us to invest in our infrastructure, make it more resilient, make it safer, make it more reliable and yet make it affordable. And so as we do our O&M cost reductions as we do efficient financing through things like our [indiscernible] sale, we have ways of offsetting the capital investment to the benefit of customers and customers will start to experience that in the coming years. And just -- here's one example. I was -- I'm sort of famous for a story of the month. So here's our story this month. In fact, it was a story of the week, if you will, because it seems like we're finding lots of opportunity all across the company. But we had an update this week from our vegetation management team and our sourcing team. We've come a long way using our lean performance playbook to standardize and improve many aspects of our business, but especially our vegetation management, which is a very important part of our safety measures here at the company. So we added visibility to the training and the safety standards for all of our contractors. We did a thorough review and removed outdated quality standards. We standardized unit rate contracts versus time and equipment contracts. We reduced our contractor count from 24 to 14 regionalizing them to better serve our hometowns. That -- this is going to be resulting for 2023 in a better customer experience, less repeat visits. I've talked about this on previous calls where we visited customer's home on multiple times to do our vegetation management work. So in this case, with all the improvements the team has made, we'll make less repeat visits to a customer's home at a lower cost. This is our performance playbook in action. The bottom line savings is going to be over $300 million just from standardizing smarter contracting and utilizing our performance playbook. That's the play we're running at PG&E. That's what's happening here. We're going to find ways to do better work for customers at a lower cost. So we are very zeroed in on making sure that we have an affordable service.\nDavid Arcaro: Great. Thanks. That's helpful color. And just related to the pacific generation sales. I was just wondering, are you able to give if that were to not be approved or if it gets delayed just how much equity might be needed into the plan in that alternative case?\nChris Foster: Sure. I think in short, you can imagine this is exactly what we were mentioning earlier, is that we're constantly looking at internal cash management levers, regulatory levers to manage any variability for you. So I think that it wouldn't necessarily change anything. I think that's our point is that we're putting ourselves in a position with a more conservative plan to be sure that we can have the most efficient financing possible. And that's why this filing makes good sense.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Okay. Great. And then just last one. I was wondering any updates on just undergrounding in terms of cost forecast or technology improvements Patti, just what you're seeing on the undergrounding opportunity and how that's evolving after we've gotten the legislation now in place?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. So we're in the process of building out our tender plan as a result of that legislation and kudos to our legislators, for making a big decision and supporting that underground -- drafting and supporting that undergrounding legislation. That 10-year plan allows for better savings for customers. Fundamentally, we can have better workforce planning. We can have better equipment, we can have better long-term contracts, and we know that all of that results in savings for customers. We're seeing good progress this year. We've completed 165 miles of civil construction already. We'll do the final buttoning up of that work and expect to meet our target of 175 miles this year, which -- you'll remember, we did about 72 miles last year. So this is a huge improvement year-over-year. And many of those miles are coming in closer to the $2.5 million a mile than the original $3.7 million a mile. So we're really seeing progress. We continue to improve, and we're looking forward to being able to publicly file that 10-year plan in 2023, so we can share what the whole outlook looks like, including the cost forecast that go with it.\nDavid Arcaro: Great. Thanks so much.\nChris Foster: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Levine from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Levine: Hi everybody.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Levine: I appreciate the updates around. Good morning, Patti. I appreciate the updates around your equity issuance plan. Curious how you're currently thinking about your dividend policy, recognizing you need board approval. But in the context of the ability to return capital to shareholders -- how are you thinking about that given the pending transaction or potential transaction when closed until after a dividend decision would be made?\nChris Foster: Ryan, thanks for the question. Again, I think we'll have maybe some initial insight. Remember, with regard to at least the current calendar we've provided to the commission and our request, which would have a mid-year initial view really of the transaction on Alpine. So it could go into our thinking a bit. But let me just take a step back. Remember that our eligibility for reinstating the dividend is when we hit $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings. And so we are well on that path at this stage and would be at the point of eligibility midyear next year. I think what you have to emphasize though, and as Patti said, there's an awful lot of need for our customers in our system. So you should assume that it's actually a very small dividend initially -- at this point, and then we would feather it in over time. Obviously, going to spend time on that going into next year with our Board and be able to come forward with more detail when we can.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Patti Poppe for closing remarks.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Julianne. Thank you everyone for joining us. We are looking forward to seeing you at EEI in just a couple of weeks, and we just hope that you are safe out there, and we look forward to seeing you in November.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned, we remain focused on delivering our financial commitments this year and we are reaffirming the five-year plan with our 2022 to 2026 earnings growth guidance remaining the same. This morning, I have a few updates to share with you. To start, I'll recap our third quarter financial results. Then I'll walk you through the details of our 2023 guidance. And lastly, I'll provide a few highlights on regulatory and legislative items. Let's start on Slide 11. With non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter coming in at $0.29, and at $0.84 for the first nine months, we're solidly on track to deliver the midpoint of our narrowed 2022 non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.10. As Patti mentioned, we took a charge of $100 million for the mosquito fire this quarter, an estimated impact that is well within our available $940 million wildfire insurance and does not factor into our walk here. We expect applicable self-insurance for this fire to be recoverable in CPUC and FERC grades. Earlier this week, the CPUC issued a proposed administrative enforcement order related to the 2020 dog fire. The proposed order recommends a penalty of $155 million. We'll look to work with the CPUC to resolve the issues identified in the proposed order as we have with other CPUC enforcement actions. While we're showing strong results year-to-date in 2022, some of the benefit is timing related and some of the benefit reflects conservative planning. But because of these efforts, we'll invest back into the system as part of maximizing every available resource for our customers and meet our commitments to you. As Patti referenced, our active efforts during the year have also allowed us to eliminate equity needs for 2022. Turning to Slide 12. With 2022 nearly complete, we're initiating 2023 guidance, consistent with our existing five-year guidance and reflective of our abundant customer safety and reliability capital investment opportunities, our 2023 non-GAAP core EPS guidance is up 10% from our 2022 midpoint at $1.21. It's reflected here within a tight range of $1.19 to $1.23. On the financing front, at the operating company, we expect to issue net long-term debt through 2023, largely in line with our planned CapEx less depreciation and our improved capital structure. An important part of our financing plan is the sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation filed with the CPUC last month. This proposed transaction would allow customers to retain the benefits of our flexible and clean generation portfolio with no bill impact while providing a source of funding to be invested in the system for their benefit. Our plan to utilize efficient financing from the proposed minority interest sale, along with moderating our parent debt paydown, result in us projecting no equity issuance in 2023 or 2024. I want to reinforce that customer affordability remains at the forefront of all our decision-making as we turn to Slide 13. Moderating customer bill growth to at or below inflation is our guidepost. And the simple affordable model is how we will get there. Our proposed minority interest sale fits squarely into the efficient financing category shown here, with proceeds providing an alternative to equity issuance. As this transaction moves through the regulatory approval process with the proposed transaction close date in Q4 2023, we are not slowing down our pursuit of additional O&M cost reductions. Our annual 2% nonfuel O&M cost reduction target remains another key aspect of our simple affordable model. And we're making additional progress on this front in our 2023 general rate case which takes us to my last topic, our key regulatory and legislative updates. Starting at the top of Slide 14. We received a proposed decision in an alternate proposed decision in our 2022 Cost of Capital proceeding. Both the proposed decision and the alternate acknowledges an extraordinary event occurred and that no automatic adjustment mechanism should be implemented. The proposed decision calls for a second phase to determine the appropriate ROE for 2022, while the ultimate call for the ROE to remain at 10.25%. In the 2023 Cost of Capital case, we expect to see a proposed decision in November, which will allow for a final decision before the end of the year. Moving to the 2023 General Rate Case. This month, we filed a settlement agreement that provides for 100% wildfire liability self-insurance. This is a great outcome for customers with the potential for up to $1.8 billion in savings over the 2023 to 2026 GRC period, and here's how it works. If approved, the settlement allows for self-insurance to be funded through CPUC jurisdictional rates starting at $400 million for test year 2023 and subsequent years into $1 billion of unimpaired self-insurance is reached. Given the high cost of wildfire insurance, this was a priority for PG&E, TURN and CAL advocates, and we'd like to thank the parties for working collaboratively on a constructive outcome for customers. We're asking for a final decision by February 2023, so we can lock in the self-insurance option for the 2023 policy year. The remainder of the 2023 general rate case continues to move through the process, with the final decision scheduled for the third quarter of 2023. Moving down the slide, we've next summarized the status on our outstanding recoveries related to wildfire risk reduction investments. We have approximately $5.7 billion outstanding at the end of the quarter. Of this amount, approximately $800 million has already been approved for cost recovery through 2023, and we anticipate an additional roughly $1 billion in additional recoveries in 2023 overall. This month, the CPUC issued both a proposed decision and an alternate proposed decision on our 2020 wildfire mitigation and catastrophic events application. While we're glad to see the movement in this case, we're disappointed with the proposed decision both of which declined to adopt our settlement agreement in full, and we will be advocating for improvements. At the bottom of this slide, we highlight two important pieces of legislation signed by the Governor last month. SB 884 provides support for a 10-year Undergrounding plan, which we'll file in 2023. And SB 846 provides for the five-year extension of Diablo Canyon, which as Patti discussed, is a great outcome for our customers and our coworkers. I'll close on Slide 15 by reiterating that we are on track to deliver our 2022 financial targets, on plan to deliver predictable results and mitigate financial risk. Our five-year commitment remains unchanged. Non-GAAP core EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti. Hey, Shahriar, good morning. So I think, say, there's a couple of things moving around, obviously. But I think maybe the place to start is what are we solving for. I think Patti really hit it earlier, which is we've got substantial capital needs for the system. We're balancing that with going forward with the best economic decisions we can make on the financing itself. That's why you heard us say moderating at the holdco debt paydown, eliminating equity needs for '23 and '24 and we're going to continue to target that mid to high-teens FFO to debt guide through the plan. So that hasn't changed. So really, we're constantly managing the ups and downs. A couple of the examples to think about even in the last couple of years. Our San Francisco general office sale, the towers related lease transaction, and now we've got the Pacific Generation transaction as well. It is embedded in the plan, Shahriar? We've got a current assumption for a year-end 2023 resolution at the CPUC. But obviously, we're going to be managing conservatively there around timing. So hopefully, that helps paint the moving pieces for you a bit. Sure, Steve. As you can imagine, we remain in continuous contact with the Fire Victim trust as given they are a large shareholder of the company. But at this point, it's definitely a very explicit decision in terms of execution of any kind of financing. Most recently, certainly, all of the saw in the market, roughly 35 million shares, just over, I think, about a month ago. So at this point, as you can imagine, it's tough for us to predict any future explicit transaction there. Sure, Steve. I think it's very limited is the way to think about it. You'd look at it and probably see about $0.03 total change. But that's in terms of our overall plan, that's pretty easy for us to manage here over that time frame. So really for us, it's about the efficient financing that this opportunity provides which is why this is really about the focus here over the next couple of years. That's correct. We'll be not explicitly pull it out. Yes, thanks for the clarifying question. Yes, they definitely are embedded. In fact, we were able to update our general rate case here recently, which really showcased the next four years of IRA impacts. So really, you could see that no material impacts in terms of the overall plan itself in the five year plan. What I would offer is kind of two different points. So one, the customer benefits that can come here from the IRAs passenger substantial. We're talking probably over $0.5 billion over the next 10 years, just purely in customer savings from reduced pricing on the renewable energy contracts and PPAs that we pursue. Then in the near term, as we look at interest rate pressure, we've already assumed that rates continue to go up. And just as a reminder for us, in terms of a rule of thumb, you can probably look at a 100 basis point move for the company's up or down is roughly $0.02 up or down. So we've already managed roughly $60 million in impacts this year and are comfortable, again, managing that going forward. Sure, Julien. I was just getting ready to jump in. Good morning. I think that as we look at the timing really around the Alpine -- excuse me, around the Pacific Generation sale. At this point, you can imagine we'll be getting greater certainty as we go into next year. We've got a midyear time frame of an initial view from the CPUC at least in what we've requested. And so once we can get further along there, I think once we also look at our dividend reinstatement, right? We're going to be able to give a better view on equity as we go out to '25 and '26. Certainly, at this point, just too early. Sure, happy to. Michael, it's here on the first one in terms of holdco debt. Again, as a reminder, we've got $4.75 billion in holdco debt at this point. And what we updated this morning is, as we're looking through the plan from now through 2026, we'd anticipate reducing that over $2 billion. So the $2 billion plus number that what we provided this morning. On cash taxes, at this stage, we were -- again, pretty specific in terms of our filing in terms of our general rate case specifically there. It's tough for me to be much more specific on cash taxes other than to say what we experienced in the five-year plan was really a generally offsetting impact from the corporate minimum tax and then the depreciation provisions that were embedded there. So really no material impact in the plan in the near term. Thanks Michael. Hi, Nick, absolutely no. Thanks for the question. I know it's a busy morning. This hasn't been asked. So happy to give you color in lease in what we can. Again, the portfolio itself is one that is very clean, right? We're talking about 5.6 gigawatts with 75% of it plus is completely GHG free and a very straightforward predictable regulatory environment for these assets themselves. So because of that, certainly have had interest in the assets themselves. But let me maybe help give you some color on timing, right, and the time frame we're looking at. We have already filed the request of the CPUC for the ability to create the subsidiary at the utility. So the way I would think about this in terms of our timing, we'll be in that marketing process with counterparties in Q1 next year. So it's a little premature for me to give a whole lot of color other than to say definitely inbounds, definitely have had interest. But we want to make a little bit more progress first here on the underlying case itself before we get into those detailed diligence discussions. Sure. Very focused there, Nick, as you can imagine. It's really two things for us. It's -- first, it's the quantitative measures, consistently focused there on FFO to debt, as we've talked about and we think that trajectory of mid to high teens puts us on that path to continue to walk up beyond the positive outlooks that we recently saw. Additionally, I think it's really important, some of the highlights that we were able to provide this morning show progress on the qualitative component. Patti really hit in detail the progress we're making with 99% risk reduction as it relates to our EPSS protocols. That's the essence of the improvements we need to be able to show operationally. Additionally, the final key piece is consistent, timely straightforward regulatory outcomes. And I think that that's what we're starting to see. We showcased both on the legislative and the regulatory side progress being made. On the legislative side with the Diablo Canyon legislation as well as Undergrounding. And then it's up to us to now file next year a comprehensive 10-year undergrounding plan and really execute that work effectively. Similarly on the regulatory side, I think that we've got right in front of us here, cost of capital-related decisions are going to be important to showing the rating agencies progress on, again, both quantitative, in terms of the FFO to debt, and then qualitative on both operational and regulatory efforts that are underway. Thanks Nick. Sure. Hi Gregg. I think there's a few steps that I can lay out there for you. So specifically, this would relate to the charges we've taken on the Dixie Fire, where the implication would be a roughly -- very small, but a roughly $150 million impact to the wildfire fund. So the way to think about this is -- we'll work our way through now with various legal claims themselves. Traditionally, takes -- you really don't get your arms around really the totality of the legal claims for roughly two to three years. Then we embark upon settlement and resolution or litigation of those claims. At that stage, you then move forward with a review at the CPUC of roughly 12 to 18 months, right? So you've got three years, then you add another 18 months for our filing related to prudency under the new AB 1054 improved construct. Only after that, once we've resolved and I believe the wording in the law is substantially resolved, most of the claims only then would you be knocking on the door of the wildfire fund for those recoveries. And so as you've seen at this stage in terms of our both -- the charge we took and the offsetting receivables, we are confident at this point that in terms of our actions at that location as a prudent operator to be able to have both recoveries above insurance at the CPUC and FERC as well as recoveries at the wildfire fund, but it will be a few years ahead of us. So we recognize -- thank you, Gregg. We do recognize those tax benefits. You'd see those on a quarterly basis as we update each quarter because any time there is a sale, both the Fire Victim Trust enjoys the tax benefit as well as the company. So we would -- you would see that updated as the three sales have happened this year directly into our financials in the subsequent quarter. Thank you, Gregg. Sure. I think in short, you can imagine this is exactly what we were mentioning earlier, is that we're constantly looking at internal cash management levers, regulatory levers to manage any variability for you. So I think that it wouldn't necessarily change anything. I think that's our point is that we're putting ourselves in a position with a more conservative plan to be sure that we can have the most efficient financing possible. And that's why this filing makes good sense. Thank you. Ryan, thanks for the question. Again, I think we'll have maybe some initial insight. Remember, with regard to at least the current calendar we've provided to the commission and our request, which would have a mid-year initial view really of the transaction on Alpine. So it could go into our thinking a bit. But let me just take a step back. Remember that our eligibility for reinstating the dividend is when we hit $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings. And so we are well on that path at this stage and would be at the point of eligibility midyear next year. I think what you have to emphasize though, and as Patti said, there's an awful lot of need for our customers in our system. So you should assume that it's actually a very small dividend initially -- at this point, and then we would feather it in over time. Obviously, going to spend time on that going into next year with our Board and be able to come forward with more detail when we can."

            "name": "Patricia Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you can see on Slide 3, we are on track to deliver our commitments to you. We've narrowed our non-GAAP core EPS range for 2022, to $1.09 to $1.11 per share. As Chris will discuss, we performed well in the third quarter, providing room to reinvest for our customers in the fourth quarter and deliver at the midpoint of our non-GAAP core EPS guidance. No more, no less. In addition, we're initiating 2023 non-GAAP core EPS guidance. You probably won't be surprised, 2023 is in line with our projected 10% growth in a band of $1.19 to $1.23. We're also reiterating our at least 10% EPS growth for 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. No change there. As you know, to fund growing important capital investment for our customers, we've been working on more efficient financing plans like the minority interest sale Pacific Generation. We've been working on plans like this for some time within our five-year planning process. As a result, we're happy to report that we forecast no equity issuance for the remainder of this year, nor in 2023 nor in 2024. There will undoubtedly be ups and downs in that time frame as we continue to resolve legacy legal matters and regulatory investigations and proceedings. We want you to know that we work hard to provide flexibility for the unknowns with an eye toward maximizing the resources available to serve the needs of our customers. Our goal is to be proactive, handle the ups and downs so that you don't have to. Our priority will always be to deliver the highest value investments for customers and deliver consistent financial results for you, our investors. Your capital is essential to our ability to make our system safer, faster and to deliver for our customers. Moving to Slide 4. We continue to be focused on Mitigating Physical Risk and Mitigating Financial Risk. I want to highlight a couple of major accomplishments for the team during the third quarter. First, we experienced a historic 10-day heat wave starting in late August, with all-time record high temperatures and all-time demand on September 6, PG&E and the people of California rose to the challenge. We avoided rotating power outages and we restored 97% of impacted customers within 12 hours. This response is a wonderful example of the PG&E team in action, partnering with the state, our fellow utilities, the California ISO and our customers, mitigating physical risk for our hometowns. Second, this quarter, on our vegetation management, our efforts since 2021 are recognized in the CPUC draft resolution recommending us to exit Step 1 of enhanced oversight. You may remember that we entered into this additional regulatory oversight as a result of our evolving vegetation management program and inconsistent risk model application in 2020. Our customers have benefited from the constructive feedback of our regulators, and we thank them for their transparency and engaging oversight. Another highlight of the quarter came as a result of the policymakers of California working hard through the legislative session to enable us to better serve our customers by passing two historic legislative packages, one for Undergrounding and another to support the extension of our Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant. As I mentioned, we continue our focus on mitigating financial risk for our customers through our simple, affordable model and mitigating financial risk for our investors by delivering consistent, predictable results and a stronger balance sheet. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to add layers of protection that we estimate have mitigated 90-plus percent of the wildfire risk on our system today. Our layers start with our Wildfire Mitigation Programs such as system hardening and Undergrounding, vegetation management and enhanced inspections and repairs. We leverage Enhanced Power Line Safety Setting Technology and our Public Safety Power Shutoff tools to keep people safe when conditions require it. We extend that protection by engaging with first responders when an ignition does occur to make sure that we are using our collective knowledge and experience to minimize the impact of fire spread. And of course, we continue to evaluate innovative solutions to move above the 90-plus percent wildfire risk reduction with a specific focus on low energy faults, which are typically not currently mitigated by EPSS. To address these faults, we're using partial voltage force out and downed conductor detection capabilities. We've implemented partial voltage detection through our smart meters across the high fire risk areas and we've had 33 partial voltage force out since the program initiation in June, with 10 potential hazards identified that could have led to potential ignition. For downed conductor detection, we've installed protection on over 5,000 miles of our overhead electric distribution lines in the high fire risk areas, and we've experienced nine downed conductor detection outages to date, any one of which could have led to a potential ignition. We'll continue to innovate and push to further increase our wildfire mitigation above the estimated 90-plus percent in place today. Here on Slide 6. You'll see our systematic approach that enables our 90-plus percent wildfire risk mitigation today. We've implemented our enhanced power line safety settings across 43,000 miles of high fire risk areas and select adjacent areas. With this systematic approach in place in 2022, we've seen a meaningful reduction in both the number of ignitions and size of fires when ignitions do occur. While ignition count alone is a primary indicator of wildfire risk, not all ignitions are the same in terms of consequence, which is why we've developed this new metric, the Ignition Impact Measure. It's simply the sum of acres burned by CPUC reportable ignitions on primary distribution assets in high fire risk areas. This measure proves to us that EPSS works. Due to our efforts in 2022, despite 36% more R3 risk days in 2022 relative to the 2018 through 2020 average, we've seen a 99% reduction in the ignition impact measure. Turning to Slide 7. We're committed to earning trust with policymakers in California, utilizing the simple, affordable model. The legislation on Undergrounding and the Diablo Canyon extension fit right into the simple affordable model, reducing financial risk by delivering safe, reliable, clean energy affordably to our customers. The benefits of the Undergrounding and Diablo Canyon extension bills are shown here on Slide 8. For Undergrounding, the major benefit versus the prior construct is the longer-term work plan, which leads to real cost savings for customers. The new law allows us to provide certainty to our workforce, create longer-term partnerships for material and equipment and inform our home counts about when they will benefit from their lines being buried. This long-term certainty is critical to accelerate permanent risk reduction of physical and financial risk for our customers. For the Diablo Canyon Power Plant extension, the new law is a key step to allow us to provide California with a large source of non-GHG emitting baseload power for another five years. The alternative would have been for us and other load-serving entities in California to procure more expensive baseload clean power to replace what is today over 8% of all of California's energy consumed, provided annually by Diablo Canyon. Replacing this power has proven challenging given clean energy supply constraints, and we estimate that this law will save customers several hundred million dollars relative to other potential baseload solutions. In addition to clean energy that provides savings to California electric customers, extending Diablo Canyon provides local jobs to over 1,000 PG&E coworkers and is a big boost to local businesses and the Central Coast economy. Moving to Slide 9. We are early on our journey with policymakers, earning trust and establishing the stability necessary to attract capital to invest on behalf of our customers. It started in 2019 with the passage of AB 1054. AB 1054 provides a framework to keep California utilities financially healthy while we do the work necessary to mitigate wildfire risk. Building on the AB 1054 Foundation, the two pieces of legislation passed in 2022 create the right outcomes for customers, mitigating physical risk and financial risk further enhancing the California regulatory construct. Looking ahead to 2023, we'll file our 10-year Undergrounding plan, informed by feedback we received from our various stakeholders and we've proposed to finalize our potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation, an example of our continuous effort on efficient financing. Earning trust also requires that we fulfill our regulatory requirements and meet our standards. When we identify a shortcoming, we own that outcome, communicate transparently and take appropriate corrective actions. This week, we're doing just that. We filed a self-report with the CPUC for a pole inspection standard gap that was identified by a team of my coworkers. Our standard did not match the CPUC standard. We found it and are on track to remediate all of the highest risk polls in question by the end of the week. I've talked a lot about how we're using Lean here at PG&E. Our performance playbook is empowering our workforce and enabling us to make gaps to standards visible and allowing us to close the gaps, making us a better operator. This is an essential part of the turnaround and culture change here at PG&E. We need to have the will to change and the skills to execute. Our performance playbook enables both. Closing on Slide 10, our report card slide. You can see here how we're tracking on our goals for 2022 and beyond. We added the mosquito fire to our CPUC reportable ignitions greater than or equal to 100 acres. Though the investigation is not complete, we can see that the fire started near the base of our 60 kV steel pole. As Chris will discuss, we booked a liability for the mosquito fire of $100 million, which is well within our range of insurance. We will miss our gas main miles replacement as we reallocated some funding to other higher risk capital spend this year. This is a good example of our Lean operating system, making visible the best choices for our customers. We are comfortable making that visible to you too. You may also notice that we increased our annual rate base growth from 9% to 9.5% through 2026. Our customers expect us to make the right infrastructure investments and this investment reflects that. We will continue to do that and manage the affordability with our simple model. The other metrics are all on track, and we feel great about our progress. With that, I'll hand it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial and regulatory items. Thank you, Chris. As I wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to take a moment to thank Matt Fallon for his dedicated service to PG&E during a very difficult time. We wish Matt, our very best, and I know you do, too. By mitigating physical and financial risk for our customers and investors, we continue on our path toward making PG&E a premium utility, and we've made tremendous progress in 2022. We know we are rebuilding this utility in a way that can last. We are turning the page on our history, focused on the new PG&E story. We trust that you feel the momentum too. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Good morning, Shahriar. Yes. Great question, Shahriar. Look, one thing that I have definitely learned is that we have a lot of work to do here at PG&E. And one thing that's been really interesting to watch is our new business applications. We have over 120,000 applications for new business in a given year. And so as we're always looking to allocate capital and making sure we're serving all of our regions appropriately and making sure we have the best service for our customers, regardless where they live in our service area, we knew that we needed to really make sure that we had enough capital deployed to make -- to serve that new business and certainly, the additional electrification that we're starting to see and our electric vehicle count continues to grow. And so capacity and new business will be a primary use. But as you can imagine, we do a lot of work on capital allocation and making sure that we can serve all of our regions well. Thanks Shahriar. Thanks Steve. Thank you, Julien. A couple of things. First, as you know, we do plan conservatively, and that's how we can be confident in our forward-looking equity forecast as well as our -- in equity guidance as well as our earnings guidance. Our goal is to ride those ups and downs. And we still, as I mentioned, we'll see legacy items. We'll see items of opportunity, and we'll see items that we can invest back in the business. It is always going to be number one for us to be balancing affordability with quality of service. And so that's -- those are the trade-offs and the precision that we balance against. And so that's what drives our earnings forecast. We think that added 10% EPS growth, we feel good about that, and we feel good that we can consistently deliver, and that's what is most important to us and to our customers. And I think that's how we best serve investors as well. We know Julien. We know. We're just keeping it on the straight and narrow here. Thank you. Thank you, Julien. Okay. Chris, why don't you take the first two, and then I'll take number three. And then I'll go on to question three on the labor availability. Michael, it's a great question. And I'm really -- I just need to give a shout out to our labor partners, the ESC and the IBW have been extraordinary partners for us as we've been really turning around the company. And just one example, we felt like we were -- we could do a better job serving the Bay Area, specifically San Francisco and the City of Oakland, and we had a challenge staffing those communities. And we worked with our union. And in fact, we challenged ourselves to add a 100 new line workers for the city of San Francisco and Oakland. And we weren't sure we would be able to find those resources. And in fact, we have. And the beauty of that is, as we hired those line workers to work here at PG&E, we were able to actually save money because we were paying premiums for contractors and we ended up saving over $8 million by in-sourcing 100 new line workers. So it's really an incredible opportunity to work with our labor unions. People want to work at PG&E and we're able to attract that talent. Good morning, Gregg. Thanks Gregg. Good morning, David. It's a great question. We definitely are seeing inflation in our actual spend. We see that. But I think what's really important to think about as we look at our filings and our GRC and the inflation update, is our commitment to affordability for customers. And so as we look at the -- our bills here in California, we do have the benefit of mild weather in most parts of our state. And so that's one piece of the puzzle here that we're aware of that our energy bills are a lower percent of wallet than in many parts of the country. However, there are parts of our state where they are more energy intensive. And so we have a very important focus on affordability, and that's what the simple affordable model is all about. We know that our customers have been really anxious for us to invest in our infrastructure, make it more resilient, make it safer, make it more reliable and yet make it affordable. And so as we do our O&M cost reductions as we do efficient financing through things like our [indiscernible] sale, we have ways of offsetting the capital investment to the benefit of customers and customers will start to experience that in the coming years. And just -- here's one example. I was -- I'm sort of famous for a story of the month. So here's our story this month. In fact, it was a story of the week, if you will, because it seems like we're finding lots of opportunity all across the company. But we had an update this week from our vegetation management team and our sourcing team. We've come a long way using our lean performance playbook to standardize and improve many aspects of our business, but especially our vegetation management, which is a very important part of our safety measures here at the company. So we added visibility to the training and the safety standards for all of our contractors. We did a thorough review and removed outdated quality standards. We standardized unit rate contracts versus time and equipment contracts. We reduced our contractor count from 24 to 14 regionalizing them to better serve our hometowns. That -- this is going to be resulting for 2023 in a better customer experience, less repeat visits. I've talked about this on previous calls where we visited customer's home on multiple times to do our vegetation management work. So in this case, with all the improvements the team has made, we'll make less repeat visits to a customer's home at a lower cost. This is our performance playbook in action. The bottom line savings is going to be over $300 million just from standardizing smarter contracting and utilizing our performance playbook. That's the play we're running at PG&E. That's what's happening here. We're going to find ways to do better work for customers at a lower cost. So we are very zeroed in on making sure that we have an affordable service. Yes. So we're in the process of building out our tender plan as a result of that legislation and kudos to our legislators, for making a big decision and supporting that underground -- drafting and supporting that undergrounding legislation. That 10-year plan allows for better savings for customers. Fundamentally, we can have better workforce planning. We can have better equipment, we can have better long-term contracts, and we know that all of that results in savings for customers. We're seeing good progress this year. We've completed 165 miles of civil construction already. We'll do the final buttoning up of that work and expect to meet our target of 175 miles this year, which -- you'll remember, we did about 72 miles last year. So this is a huge improvement year-over-year. And many of those miles are coming in closer to the $2.5 million a mile than the original $3.7 million a mile. So we're really seeing progress. We continue to improve, and we're looking forward to being able to publicly file that 10-year plan in 2023, so we can share what the whole outlook looks like, including the cost forecast that go with it. Good morning, Ryan. Thank you, Julianne. Thank you everyone for joining us. We are looking forward to seeing you at EEI in just a couple of weeks, and we just hope that you are safe out there, and we look forward to seeing you in November."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PG&E Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Fallon, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Fallon: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for PG&E\u2019s second quarter earnings call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company\u2019s actual financial results are described in the second page of today\u2019s second quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures. The presentation can be found online, along with other information, at investor.pgecorp.com. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. With that, I will hand it over to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I will focus on three key areas today: first, our financial results; second, our continued work to build trust with policymakers and play our role as an enabler for California\u2019s prosperity; and third, I\u2019ll provide an update on our wildfire mitigation progress. Our results through the first half keep us on track to deliver our full year 2022 non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.13. We have got the system in place to manage the inevitable pluses and minuses. The system provides confidence that we will deliver our commitment of at least 10% non-GAAP core EPS growth through 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. As a result of further progress on legacy items, our rate neutral securitization and good cash management, we are lowering and narrowing our equity guidance. We are projecting a need of $0 to $250 million for the remainder of the year. We are on the right path to mitigate financial risk and deliver the consistent results you can expect from PG&E. We are continuing to build trusting relationships with policymakers and work with them on outcomes that are good for our customers and allow us to deliver the energy they want safely and reliably. Earlier this year, Governor Newsom reached out to ask us to evaluate keeping Diablo Canyon open beyond its scheduled retirement in 2024 and 2025 to support the capacity and liability of the state\u2019s electric supply system. We are exploring the possibility of keeping this plant open for California\u2019s benefit. It is not an easy option and it will require much coordination between the state, multiple regulatory bodies and PG&E as well as many others impacted by the outcome of this decision. We of course are motivated to be of service to the people of California and our policymakers and we will continue to work with the state regarding the future of Diablo Canyon and to ensure reliability. I am very thankful to our team at the plant for continuing to remain focused on safe and excellent operations as the conversation and decisions move forward. We are also continuing to work with legislators on Senate Bill 884. The amended language in the undergrounding bill provides a supportive framework for PG&E to follow long-term undergrounding plan, which is good for customers and investors, because it allows us to build a more robust plan for labor, the lowest cost contracts and provide the fastest path to eliminating the highest risk and moving reliability at the same time on our power lines. I am pleased with the relationships we are building with these key policymakers in California. We are proud to be recognized as essential to California safety and clean energy goals. Our ability to continue to demonstrate the turnaround of PG&E enables long-term relationships built on mutual benefit and prosperity. Just this week, we filed our final responses in the review of our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. We welcome the healthy dialogue with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety and we believe our responses address their concerns, make our plans stronger and make our communities safer. We look forward to a draft decision on our Wildfire Mitigation Plan by the end of September. Given the dry conditions we have seen in our service area in 2022, I thought I\u2019d spend some time discussing our wildfire mitigation tools described on Slide 5. As a result of the significant work that we have completed since 2019, combined with the protocols we have implemented for our EPSS and PSPS programs, we estimate that we have mitigated more than 90% of the wildfire risk in our service area. Our approach to catastrophic wildfire mitigation is driven by multiple layers of protection, starting with vegetation management, enhanced inspection and our longer term system hardening work anchored by our undergrounding plans. While we continue to make progress on our longer term mitigations, we layer in EPSS and PSPS to mitigate risk today. Our situational awareness capability, which we have built over the past 3 years, including installation of our high-definition cameras, the use of enhanced technology in our hazard awareness and warning center, and the expertise of our safety and infrastructure protection team, allow for better coordination and faster response should emission occur, providing our final layer of protection. The 90% risk mitigation today is informed by the results we are seeing in operations. For example, on the circuits where we have implemented our EPSS program, we have observed significant reductions in reportable ignitions and the acres impacted per ignition this year are significantly lower despite very dry conditions. We are continuing to pursue opportunities to improve beyond the 90% risk mitigation with additional innovative technology solutions such as partial voltage SmartMeter alarms\u2019 inbound conductor capability. We anticipate that additional opportunities, including undergrounding, will provide us with greater long-term protection while reducing the customer impact. As you can see on Slide 6, the Fire Potential Index guides our wildfire mitigation efforts. Most of the damage in recent years have occurred under R3 and higher conditions. In recent years, we have experienced more acres and structures damaged due to fire spread driven by fuels and terrain. To mitigate the fuels and terrain driven risk, in 2022 we have enabled EPSS for all fire potential conditions across all our high fire risk areas, except under conditions of heavy fog, high humidity and precipitation. Historically, nearly all of the acres and structures burned during extreme wind events. For these conditions, categorized as R5 and higher, we rely on our PSPS program. I talked a lot about mitigating physical risk today. As I know, this is a key area of concern given the impact of climate change across California and the rest of the world. As you have heard, we have the right system in place to keep our co-workers and our customers safe from physical risk and a mindset that has us continuously improving that system everyday. Please be assured that the team and I are also continually focusing on mitigated financial risk. We know our customers are experiencing major inflationary impacts outside of utility bills. And at PG&E, we are planning to keep costs down even as we invest in our system by utilizing our simple and affordable model. I am going to focus on the non-fuel O&M cost reduction line you see here on Slide 7. I am never short on stories and this quarter is no different. Here is the simple example of an opportunity we came across in our inspection work. People often think it will cost more to do high-quality work. I beg to differ. Last year, due to multiple verification methodologies between our vegetation management pre-inspectors and our work verification team, we had a 40% rejection rate on tree inspections, resulting in a crew coming back out to correct the miss. We cut that rejection rate by half already this year by adopting a uniform technology-driven inspection process, saving almost $100 million. Better first-time quality is more affordable. One example of many such opportunities, we are just getting started here and there is a long runway of opportunities across the entire enterprise that the team is learning to uncover. On the financing front, we successfully completed our rate neutral securitization bond issuance in July using the proceeds to pay-down temporary utility debt to strengthen our balance sheet. Importantly, S&P moved our outlook to stable after the rate neutral issuance. We are following through on our commitment to you, our investors, to delever our balance sheet and reduce financing costs for our customers, a real-time demonstration of our simple and affordable model in action. Finally, let\u2019s turn to our report card, which you can see here on Slide 8. We chose these metrics to show you where our focus is, delivering consistent outcomes through 2022 and beyond by building on our culture and our capabilities. One metric I want to highlight is our CPUC reportable emissions greater than or equal to 100 acres in high fire-threat areas. Fires this size are a small percentage of ignitions, but account for more than 90% of the acres burned and more than 95% of the structures damaged from 2015 to 2021 in our service area. We have zero CPUC reportable admissions over 100 acres so far in 2022. You will recall that in early June, PG&E filed an electric incident report on the old fire, which was 570 acres with no reported serious injuries, fatalities or structural damage. We filed the EIR as required, because Cal Fire collected our equipment and there was media attention. However, we are not recording this as a CPUC reportable admission at this time as we are not aware of any damage to our equipment at Cal Fire\u2019s suspected ignition point. Cal Fire is continuing their investigation on the cause of the fire and we will review the final report when it\u2019s available and the associated recordability accordingly. In addition, last week, the Oak Fire started in Mariposa County. After the time of the reported ignition, we de-energized lines for firefighter safety at the request of Cal Fire. Based on our review of our data, we are not aware of any information suggesting our facilities were involved in the ignition. We have not filed an EIR and Cal Fire continues their investigation into the cause of the fire. We do want to take this opportunity to thank our firefighters in the broader first responder community for working so hard to keep our communities safe. Physical and financial risk reductions are the building blocks that enable predictable results for customers and investors. I feel good about progress to-date. With that, I will hand it over to Chris to provide a deeper dive into our financial and regulatory items.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Patti. We are on track to deliver our financial commitments this year. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2022 to 2026 earnings per share CAGR of 10% and reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. As Patti mentioned, I am pleased to share that we just issued $3.9 billion of our rate neutral securitization bond at a weighted average rate of 5.05%. Our transaction completes a critical element of our reorganization financing plan, with a total of $7.5 billion of securitization bonds now issued. This contributes to our focus on near-term efficient financing. The recent actions by both S&P and Fitch on our credit ratings reflect increasing confidence in our plans to make the investment our customers need and affordably finance our system enhancement. This morning, I want to cover three key areas, where we are laser-focused on mitigating financial risk and delivering predictable outcomes for you, our investors. First, a recap of our second quarter and first half financial results and a reiteration of our full year guidance; second, a deeper dive into our results ownership center and how we are using that to execute from a simple and affordable model; and finally, a few highlights on important regulatory and legal matters. Slide 9 shows our second quarter and first half results. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.25 ended $0.55 for the first half of the year. We recorded non-GAAP core income of $536 million for the second quarter of 2022. This income keeps us on pace to hit the common stock dividend reinstatement eligibility criteria by mid-2023. Moving to Slide 10, our first half EPS growth is on target at $0.55, up $0.05 or 10% from last year. You can see our rate-based growth of $0.03 per share in the first half and another $0.04 projected for the second half, a clear reflection of our investments in customer priorities. Please also note our favorable cost performance of $0.04 so far and another $0.02 to $0.04 planned for the second half. Combined, this tracks nicely to our roughly $200 million or 2% non-fuel O&M reduction plan. What you do not see here in our yearly forecast are risks due to pension costs that we manage on behalf of our coworkers. Due to our longstanding pension recovery mechanism approved by the CPUC, we do not see an impact to earnings even with the current market volatility. There are other changes, including our regulatory agenda as well as tax and other items. And combined, this shows how we are delivering on our at least 10% EPS growth this year, consistent progress to deliver for our customers and investors. As shown next on Slide 11, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP core EPS of $1.07 to $1.13. We are also narrowing and lowering our equity range for 2022 and are now forecasting $0 million to $250 million in equity needs for the year. As we resolve legacy claims, which I will talk about a bit later, we maintain our confidence that our equity needs will be limited this year. Let\u2019s move to our simple and affordable model. We adopted this model to help produce medium and long-term financial risk for both our customers and you, our investors. The model allows us to reduce risk for our customers holding down bill increases over time. And we will deliver on this model by using the lean operating system, which allows us to actively manage variability. It\u2019s about evaluating and executing against opportunities like putting lasting fixes instead of temporary repairs in the system, which helps avoid expense in costs that would otherwise flow through right away to our customers. Our efforts on this front give us greater confidence in our financial targets for the long-term. It starts with lean and how my coworkers are using these proven techniques to manage performance, reducing medium and long-term financial risk. Turning to Slide 13, for the past 8 months, we have been maturing our process to bring improved visibility and control to executing our work plans affordably in a room we fondly refer to as the ROC, short for the Results Ownership Center. On the left hand side of the slide, you can see the elements of visibility and control. In the ROC, we hold a weekly cross-functional operating review focused on our plan and performance against our financial targets. This is the same method we have used to consistently deliver on our operational goals for our Wildfire Mitigation Plan over the last year. You have heard Patti say, we split the details, so you don\u2019t have to. The ROC is where that statement comes to life. Additionally, we leveraged the 1-3-10 concept of visual management. Using consistently refreshed data, all attendees can tell within 1 second if our performance is on track; within 3 seconds, which way the metric is trending; and within 10 seconds, the recovery plan for any metric that is not on track. Managing all aspects of variability, as shown on the right hand side of the slide is how we deliver predictable results. When a key financial metric is off-track or trending off-track we identify it almost immediately, using current data, not month old or quarter old data. The conversation always includes who is doing what by when. And the resulting cash back plan will include a combination of short-term containment and long-term countermeasures. In addition to O&M and capital cost performance, our focus in the ROC this year has been on efficiencies in our contracted spending, evaluating productive time, expense to capital optimization that create lasting system enhancements for customers and internal staffing levels. Taking productive time, for example, in addition to the training rationalization Adam Wright discussed at Investor Day, we have also improved our time reporting this year based on an idea serviced at the ROC. Our coworkers in the field now explicitly report hours lost due to no work or work delays when they are not able to charge to a specific job. Having this data now readily available allows us to problem solve. Work delays can occur when a crew cannot access the customer\u2019s property, for example, but with good planning, we can enable that crew with a backup job. The simple change to our time reporting has uncovered a huge opportunity to increase productive hours. And just a 1% improvement translates to approximately 30,000 more productive hours per month. You can imagine we are excited about how this can translate into better outcomes for the hometowns we serve. This example, along with our focus on first-time quality that Patti spoke to, and many others, is how through the ROC, our entire enterprise owns our financial results and not just members of the finance team. Again, visibility and control provide predictable results. Our focus is on delivering that for you, our customers and our investors. Now I will cover the key regulatory legislative and legal updates for the quarter. Turning to Slide 14, at the top, as I mentioned in opening, we have now issued a full $7.5 billion in rate neutral securitization bonds. We have used those proceeds to payoff $5 billion of utility temporary debt and will payoff the remaining $1 billion in the first quarter of 2023 as that debt becomes callable. The remaining proceeds will go towards paying down short-term borrowings at the utility. Completion of the securitization was a key aspect of improving our balance sheet. And as a result, last week, S&P moved us to Stable outlook. And in June, Fitch Ratings revised their outlook, moving us from Stable to Positive. Keeping with the theme of securitization, as expected, on June 29, the CPUC issued a favorable proposed decision granting our request to securitize up to approximately $1.4 billion of eligible AB 1054 capital expenditures previously found reasonable in the 2020 GRC. We expect a final vote on this proceeding on August 4, which \u2013 that timing keeps us on plan to proceed with a bond issuance later this year or early 2023. These securitizations are an important aspect of our financing plan, a stronger balance sheet, improved credit ratings and reduced borrowing spreads. Moving down the slide. We made substantial progress resolving legacy securities\u2019 legal claims. The net impact we\u2019re reflecting this quarter is $145 million. We believe this is a constructive outcome within our forecasted equity needs. Additionally, in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and based on the status of discussions with certain subrogation entities and individual claimants, during this quarter, we recorded an incremental charge of $150 million for additional potential losses above available insurance. The movement you\u2019re seeing in this bucket of legacy claims demonstrates our commitment to putting these litigation matters in the rearview mirror. And we\u2019re making progress on these key legal matters while maintaining our focus on financing. As a reminder, we have now reduced and narrowed our 2022 equity needs range from $100 million to $400 million, down to a range of $0 to $250 million. Next on the slide, we summarize the status that are yet to be recovered wildfire-related spend. As you can see, we have approximately $5.2 billion outstanding at the end of the quarter. Of this amount, approximately $1 billion is approved for cost recovery in 2022 and 2023. Clearly, we still have more work to do, but just around the quarter in September, we plan to file our next WMCE application. And as a reminder, based on the CPUC schedule, we expect proposed decisions on both our 2020 and 2021 WMCE filings during Q4 this year. Together, these represent the majority of the $2.2 billion shown here as pending a final decision. And finally, at the bottom of this slide, we are highlighting our two outstanding cost of capital applications. The CPUC held oral arguments in the 2022 case last Friday, where we had a chance to reiterate our position that the cost of capital components should remain at pre-2022 levels for 2022. This month, the CPUC also issued a scoping memo in our 2023 cost of capital application. The commission accepted our request to include an updated cost of debt in September, which we think is constructive given where rates have moved. The schedule provides for a possible final decision of the CPUC last business meeting of the year on December 15. Before I move from key regulatory cases, just a brief update on the 2023 GRC for which we\u2019ve requested a test year revenue requirement of $15.34 billion. On July 11, we submitted our rebuttal testimony responding to GRC proceeding stakeholders\u2019 comments and recommendations. We continue to defend our request and is the next step for evidentiary hearing starting on August 15. We expect a final decision in the third quarter of 2023. I\u2019ll close by reiterating that we\u2019re on track to deliver our 2022 financial targets, using proven tools and techniques to lean to deliver predictable results, mitigating financial risk. Our commitment is worth repeating again, non-GAAP core EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Chris. As we move through 2022, we\u2019re focused on minimizing physical and financial risk. Our layers of protection start with system inspections, repairs, vegetation management, overhead hardening and our 10,000-mile undergrounding program, which provide long-term sustainable climate-resilient infrastructure. In the near-term, additional layers of protection are provided by engineered enhanced power line safety settings when fuel risk is high and our public safety power shutoff program during high wind events. Our coordination with local and statewide agencies and situational awareness and fast response continues to strengthen and reduce our physical risk and provide a final and essential layer of protection. To mitigate financial risk for customers and investors, we will continue to fully deploy our simple and affordable model. I\u2019m pleased with the progress as I see our relationships and trust growing with policymakers and stakeholders here in California. PG&E is an essential contributor to California\u2019s prosperity. We will keep an eye on the horizon and ensure we\u2019re making the right investments to deliver California\u2019s clean energy future. Something really exciting is blossoming here at PG&E. We feel the momentum, and we hope you do too. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold: Yes. Good morning, guys.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Jonathan.\nJonathan Arnold: Hi, could I ask as just a \u2013 could we get an update on the EPSS effectiveness you\u2019re experiencing in \u201822? I know you spoke to the overall 90% risk mitigation, but are we still seeing that kind of 80% reduction that you talked about at the Analyst Day or is that \u2013 has that evolved somewhere?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Jonathan, first of all, as we talk about EPSS, let\u2019s just step back for a second and remember that the objective was to end catastrophic wildfire. That\u2019s the objective of the program. And for that, we have layers of protection, EPSS being one of them. So on EPSS effectiveness, we\u2019re in the 70-plus range right now as we\u2019ve gotten a larger sample size, and obviously, conditions are very challenging here in California, we feel good about that 70% because in concert with the 70% plus ignition reduction, the acres burned per ignition is dramatically lower in the plus 65% range. And so we feel like that is a really important sign of progress. And in fact, we\u2019re working on a new metric, Jonathan. It\u2019s not ready for prime time, but what we\u2019re looking at is sort of an ignition times acres burned. And as we look back on previous years, we\u2019ve seen significant improvement. We look at that, all of that driving towards the elimination of catastrophic wildfire. The other thing I\u2019ll share on EPSS effectiveness that we feel good about is the duration of those outages has dropped dramatically year-over-year. In fact, we set a target for ourselves of 240 minutes, and we are well under that year-to-date. And so our operations team has done an extraordinary job responding to this new configuration of a system that, frankly, no one else in the industry at this scope and scale has this sort of safety measure in place. And we continue to have successful conversations with communities who are most impacted by EPSS. In fact, Pismo Beach is a good example a community down by San Luis Obispo was experiencing multiple outages. Our engineering team went and studied that circuit was able to make repairs and modifications and engineering improvements to significantly reduce the outages. And so we held webinars with the community and the local leaders gave us very positive feedback about our responsiveness. And so we just continue to be focused on our hometowns and making sure that we\u2019re keeping everybody safe.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning, guys.\nChris Foster: Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Patti, I just wanted to maybe start off with the progress that\u2019s being made on kind of multiple fronts in terms of physical de-risking, in particular, kind of how the undergrounding plans are evolving and just the general sensitivity of the CPUC around affordability. And just as a quick follow-up, understanding, like, the regulatory process is still ongoing, but \u2013 what are the current expectations from potential moves with legislation? And any updates around the RFP process where that stands from Jacobs on implementing the program? Thanks.\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Thanks, Shar. Well, it\u2019s great because undergrounding and affordability go hand-in-hand. Undergrounding is a great example of our simple and affordable model at work, where we\u2019re going to be able to transition from a highly expense-intensive vegetation management program to more permanent corrective action, which is undergrounding the lines. As you may remember, when we filed our modification to the GRC, we added $7 billion of capital first couple of years of the undergrounding plan, and offset with $1 billion of expense reduction, resulting in a flat \u2013 no modification essentially to the rate increases of that ask. And so \u2013 we think it\u2019s an important combination. I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re really pleased with the progress on the undergrounding bill. I think it shows a couple of things. Number one, our customers have been demanding that we invest in our infrastructure. I\u2019ve seen so many quotes and headlines about PG&E, underinvested in its infrastructure. This is our pathway to investing in the infrastructure to keep our people safe and have a climate resilient energy system. Our legislators see the same thing. And they are working with us. Senate Bill 884 is making progress. We like the current draft. There is still \u2013 it\u2019s still a live ball, I would say. There is still modifications that can be made, and so we\u2019re continuing to work closely. But we like the idea that there is clarity to a long-term plan and clarity that the legislature expects us and will hold us accountable to completing this undergrounding plan. We want that, too. And so that accountability then translates into a 10-year plan and the OEIS and the CPUC are directed to review and approve that in a timely fashion, which allows us to save the most dollars for our customers. It allows us to do that massive infrastructure project at the most affordable price. It gives us the opportunity to better long-term contracts, better access to equipment at a lower cost, Staffing up a labor workforce to deliver that incredible infrastructure project. And so I just feel like undergrounding is such a perfect example of the simple affordable model at work and making the system safe.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Thank you, Patti. And just one last quick one in terms of the guidance, the reduction in equity needs is certainly really appreciated there. You have securitization getting debt off the balance sheet. Does that open some opportunity to maybe simplify financing means going forward? Thanks.\nChris Foster: Hi, Shar, it does. I think if you look at equity, what we\u2019ve said is that really looking forward to getting some of these important legacy items behind us, which we were able to make progress on including this quarter. That helped us refine and really narrow our equity guide for the year. And that\u2019s really ultimately about a good financing plan that\u2019s looking a couple of years out at any point. We also got, as you mentioned, the rate neutral securitization completely done here by midyear, which was nice because, ultimately \u2013 we\u2019re initially unsure if we could get it all done at this point or if it was going to take us to the end of the year. And then on the debt side, ultimately, you\u2019ve got a couple of things there, right? They are going to help us further simplify. First, we\u2019ve got an 80 10 54 securitization. That\u2019s really our next one coming up that we\u2019re hoping to execute later this year or early next. And then along the same time frame, we\u2019re probably going to be looking at ongoing needs for long-term debt which really just finance our rate base growth, and that\u2019s consistent with our base financing plan.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Shar.\nChris Foster: Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning, team. Thank you very much and congrats again on another quarter with a zero 100-acre-plus fire. So good stuff.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. I want to recognize it. Maybe just more of a financial question, your equity issuance, can we talk about the reduced needs here and how to think about that in the long-term, obviously, moving things in the right direction here? Can you talk about just what drove that in part, but also more specifically, how we can think about longer-term means as well here? Especially if you want to avoid them considering what the stock is. So I appreciate the continued hustle.\nChris Foster: Absolutely, Julien. And I think you said it that ultimately, our focus is going to be uncertainly where we\u2019re trading at this point to have to make the best economic decision we can. And so obviously, looking at the 5-year plan at this stage, and really the focus is consistently on making sure that we\u2019re putting these legacy items front and center because they are a driver for us. Specifically, you saw us resolve or make substantial progress and able to bound the securities claims right at $145 million. We\u2019re making progress on the Kincade related claims. And so we\u2019ve got a much better focus now with the increase we had there quarter-over-quarter on where that will land as well. And as you can imagine, those are two key drivers. As you look in future years, we are going to have fewer implications on that front. We are going to have \u2013 obviously, the odd fire is completely covered by insurance at this stage. So you can imagine, Julien, that really our folks is going to be on making it right with these communities where we need to. That\u2019s going to be the core focus of the company. At the same time, we\u2019ve got to actively manage our financing needs, which is I think what you\u2019re seeing in the results of this year and bringing down the range from $1 million to $400 million down to $0 to $250 million this quarter.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. Let me pivot here to Diablo super quickly. How is the new AB 205 and 180 impact you guys as well as the federal efforts here? I mean, is that bill potentially able to help defray costs from the state back to the Fed in terms of paying for Diablo? And ultimately, I suppose the bottom line is also what does it mean financially for you all considering that you were going to have a fully appreciated asset in a couple of years there?\nPatti Poppe: So Julien, obviously, Diablo Canyon is very much on our minds. And so if we step back and just think about what is being discussed here and what the path forward is, first of all, it\u2019s \u2013 we continue to remind all engaged parties that the clock is ticking here. we\u2019ve got a real sense of urgency in order to transition from being in a decommissioning posture to a life extension posture. So the most important thing to us right now is that we get certainty on the decision-making. We have to secure tasks. We have to order fuel. There is some very near-term items that \u2013 actions that we would need to take if, in fact, we changed the posture of the plant. And so with that, we\u2019re working very closely with the state first to understand what are the needs and what do we need to do to forward. This is not an easy option. Legislation will have to be passed. The permitting and relicensing of the facility is complex. And so there is a lot of hurdles to be overcome in order to move forward. However, we like the fact that, that plant\u2019s value is being recognized by the state that there seems to be kind of a shift in the attitude about the role that nuclear can play in a GHG-free economy. And so obviously, our team at Diablo continues to do great work and earn the respect of the citizens of California and the policymakers as well. We do think that the DOE funding is a possibility. And certainly, the state has expressed interest in maximizing that and making sure that Diablo Canyon gets included in the DOE\u2019s program to extend the life of nuclear. Again, nationally, I think there is been a real shift in attitude about the value of these baseload nuclear facilities. And so given that, we\u2019re just going to continue to work through the financials, and that will be second to making sure that the plant is ready and safe and able to operate for the state.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And just financially for you guys, again, it\u2019s a depreciated asset by about \u201825 here, right? I mean, we shouldn\u2019t think about that earnings impact beyond any differently?\nChris Foster: That\u2019s accurate, Julien. At this stage, that was part of our prior agreement with the CPUC to fully depreciate the assets by the end of \u2013 we are talking in light of the second unit in 2025. We are also watching certainly the different pieces are moving on the state level. Patti did well that we are looking at the federal level. The state also has a resiliency fund that they are looking at. And additionally, you mentioned the specific piece of the legislation, including customer [indiscernible]. And certainly, I think that that\u2019s a good example of the legislature acting on behalf of our customers and helping to lower cost. And so certainly, there is a financing advantage for \u2013 in that for us as well.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright. Excellent, guys. Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time today. Maybe a quick follow-up on Diablo Canyon, you spoke to some of the hurdles there, but could you speak to the timing at all in terms of if there is a red line when you need to address a few of those items in switching from decommissioning to life extension?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. So legislation \u2013 we believe legislation \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty well agreed that the legislation is required in order to change the permitting and relicensing time line. And so the legislature is \u2013 needs to pass any new laws by the end of April, April 30, and then they are signed by the governor in September. And so that really drives an important deadline for us. And in addition to the fact that we need to order cast and the fuel \u2013 and so given that the combination of that timing really does drive the decision-making.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Thank you. And then switching gears here, I am curious you could speak to the timeline and achievability of addressing the residual wildfire risk that\u2019s on top of the 90% estimated mitigation today? Are these items that you are focused on in the near-term or sort of longer term aspirations as technology evolves?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. We are implementing new technologies as we speak, literally. In fact, when we look at the utilization of our smart meter technology to its full potential, it can identify risks and faults on the system, and we are already implementing that system-wide. So, that\u2019s an additional layer of protection. Another layer of protection is on our secondary lines or down conductors. We have new settings that we can utilize and some new technology in a controller box that we are deploying out to the system as we speak. So, what I can tell you is every single day, we have a technology team who is focused on ending catastrophic wildfire. Our team at our advanced technology center, ATS, they are working night and day to come up with new and better technologies to deploy. So, we are not waiting, you can rest assured. And as the quarters progress, we will continue to share progress on those additional layers of protection that we are putting in.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Thank you for the color.\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a good first half of the year. Real quickly, how are you thinking about Dixie, the Dixie Wildfire, and the potential for this to be the test case to kind of \u2013 I don\u2019t know, see how AB 1054 actually gets put to work when it comes to a wildfire that may have over $1 billion in cost? Just kind of walk us through where that stands potentially? And is this going to be, in your view, the potential trial run to see how this all plays out?\nChris Foster: Michael, happy to take it. I think that there is that potential. At this stage, as you know, we recorded $1.15 billion total impact. And so that would imply that the $150 million here could interact with the wildfire fund itself. I just have to emphasize this could take some time. I think in the interim, what we are very focused on, including with an accelerated claims process in the community is making sure that we have impacted families paid quickly. So, at this point, we have got over 100 claims that have come forward in that way and that have allowed us to compensate impacted local communities quickly. So, that\u2019s the near-term. Over time, there is really the way to think about this is we have got our insurance layer itself, CPUC recoveries above that of roughly $360 million. You have got then FERC related recoveries of roughly $100 million. And then ultimately, the remainder will be tapping the wildfire fund. So, there could be time here before we really get to the stage of tapping the fund because the statute actually requires that you are substantially completed with your claims themselves before you move forward to the fund. I think in terms of the fact pattern and our operational prudency as it related to Dixie Fire, I think we have been quite clear that in terms of vegetation management, in terms of the management of our assets and the appropriate response. I think all of those things position us well for the recovery themselves at the various jurisdictions, including at the wildfire fund.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thanks Chris. And just one quick one, can you remind me when is the last date or the deadline for when either property or other claims have to be filed for Dixie?\nChris Foster: Sure thing. So, there is two to keep in mind. The first would be personal injury statute of limitations, which runs from 2 years from the incident. And then property damage, which is 3 years. Those are the two primary drivers of claims and claims timing.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Chris. Much appreciate it guys.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nNick Campanella: Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just ask about the pending wildfire legislation in the Senate here. I understand we are kind of in recess and this will go through August. But I believe there have been some amendments. And I am just curious, current bill as it stands today, if it was passed, how would that affect your plan? Is it acceptable in current form? And what should we kind of expect here as we get to the end of August?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. We feel good about the current draft. Some of the things that we did not like about the previous drafts have been removed. I think it was important for our legislatures \u2013 legislators and the authors of the bill to understand how important it was that the financial mechanisms be in place, so we can attract the high-value capital to fund the program. We know it\u2019s important to you to have certainty for your clients to make sure that those moms and pops who invest their money in a utility can count on a predictable return. And so I think that was a really good understanding that we formed there. So, the language is good about cost recovery, the permitting assistance as well as especially the legislative direction to OEIS and the CPUC to support a 10-year plan, which would be outside the general rate case. An infrastructure project of this scope and scale is so important, it would be longer term. So, we can get the labor force ready, we can get the equipment ready, we can get the long-term contracts. That will save our customers the most money. We can do the program at the lowest total cost when we have that longer term plan. And so having visibility transparency and frankly, accountability to \u2013 for us to do what we said we are going to do and to get the unit cost where we want the unit cost. I think it\u2019s in the best interest of everyone to have this kind of legislative direction to provide the certainty that we need. And just to remind you on timing, August 31 is the deadline for bills to be passed and sent to the governor. And then September 30 is the last day the governor can sign a bill. And so that will be the timing of that legislative activity.\nNick Campanella: Great. Thanks. Appreciate that. And I know it\u2019s just happened yesterday, but just Inflation Protection Act and the AMT specifically, if there is an alternative minimum tax, how does that affect the company? I mean just looking at the BBB example, maybe you have done some work there already?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. In fact, Nick, I was in Washington, D.C. 2 days ago, in fact, with a small group of CEOs focused on this climate package, encouraging its inclusion in this new program. And it\u2019s amazing to me how much can happen in two days. And so we are excited about clean energy components of the package. We think that it will allow us to continue to grow the clean energy assets here in California by a variety of owners, not just the utility, but making sure that we have got that clean energy transition at the most economic and lowest societal cost. We are excited about the inclusion of hydrogen and the standalone storage credits. We are studying the implications for the EV credits, but it looks like the cap is being proposed to be lifted, which would be good and important here in California because EVs are such an important part of our future. Of course, like I would suppose most businesses, we don\u2019t love the corporate minimum tax. For us, it is a pass-through, which is why we don\u2019t like it. It puts affordability pressure directly on our customers. And so there is obviously a lot of discussion about that. We will continue to work our simple and affordable model, however, and we will ride that rollercoaster so you don\u2019t have to. We will make the necessary adjustments to continue to build our funding, our infrastructure for our customers as they would wish and lower costs in a variety of areas, if, in fact, that additional cost gets borne by our customers.\nNick Campanella: Got it. Thanks. I appreciate that. Just one more follow-up, if I can, just on the Victims Trust, I think we have seen some turnover in the folks that are running the trust and just kind of curious on what the conversations have been of late, if you could provide any kind of color on the relationship or just in general, your ability to align yourself even more than before there?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Nick, thanks for asking the question. I had a very productive conversation with the new administrator, Cathy Yanni. She is a professional. She has been in this business for many \u2013 well, her whole career, and she was very impressive to me. I was happy to have a chance to talk with her. We clarify \u2013 I clarified for her that we want what they want. We want to maximize the value of this agreement that was made on behalf of victims. And obviously, our stock price has an impact on that and their actions with the volume of shares that they own have an impact on the stock price. And so we talked about that, and we talked about how working together could be very beneficial to the victims and that\u2019s our sole focus. And again, we want what they want, to make it right. And we obviously think working together with them is more productive than working independently. However, they have been clear that they want to make sure that they get certainty around the dollars that they will have available to distribute to victims. And if you check their website, you can see they have made a significant progress in disbursing funds. She is very focused on doing that efficiently and effectively, and so certainty helps them. Bottom line, we want what they want, and we will look forward to continuing to work with them.\nNick Campanella: Alright. Thanks for everything today.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks Nick.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.\nGregg Orrill: Yes. Hi. Good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning Gregg.\nGregg Orrill: So, maybe following up on Nick\u2019s question, are you looking at additional ways to provide certainty to the fire victims?\nPatti Poppe: I \u2013 the ball is really in their court. They own the stock, and it\u2019s up to them how they want to disperse it.\nGregg Orrill: Okay, got it. And then just on the wildfire-related cost recovery, the $5.2 billion, could you tie that back to recoveries timeline and how that sort of quantify the improvement in FFO to debt? Would it tie back to the credit measures?\nChris Foster: Sure thing, Gregg. I think that this is going to be a key for the company over the next, really, 2 years, primarily with the majority of the funds coming in 2023 and 2024, and then help us from a cash flow perspective. The things to keep in mind are really two. First, quarter-over-quarter, the overall increase that you saw, a move of roughly $0.5 billion was directly related to prior vegetation management work that was critical for the system. Second thing to keep in mind is that we do have two important data points here that are expected in Q4, which is the resolution of both the 2020 Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Event or WMCE related account as well as the 2021. When you look at those two together, that\u2019s roughly the $2.2 billion that we have talked about. So, those are going to be key in terms of getting resolution there and then keeping us on track for our FFO guidance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning David.\nDavid Arcaro: Wanted to check in on load growth and what you are seeing this year. I know longer term, you have got targets and it\u2019s an important component to reduce the customer bill impact from your rate base growth over time. And that\u2019s driven by longer term programs around electrification and EVs. But I guess I am curious what you are seeing currently this year and expectations for the rest for the year in terms of loan growth?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. So, we are continuing to look at that. We definitely see continued load growth. It\u2019s lower at this early part of our 5-year plan. At the latter part of the 5-year plan and then going into the 10-year plan, we see significantly more forecast. It will be interesting to see if the additional incentives on EVs accelerate adoption here in California. But as we have said, 1% to 3% is in our long-term forecast.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then, Patti, you mentioned a couple of technology aspects, the partial voltage detection, down conductor programs just to kind of attack that last 10% of the risk. When will we see maybe programs like that get officially rolled out or target set in place and kind of quantified?\nPatti Poppe: Well, the partial voltage detection through our smart meters is deployed. That is deployed as we speak. And so, we are learning a lot as we get those partial voltage alarms. We have a 60-minute response time. We are trying to narrow that into even less than that, so we can get out and observe the situation and find out if it is in fact unsafe. And so in the coming months, you will get more \u2013 we will share more insights with you on what we are learning there. Again, that\u2019s an infrequent occurrence, but it is an occurrence. And then the down conductor, I think has a ton of potential. It does require new hardware. Some of the hardware that we have on the system can be reprogrammed and so we are doing that as we speak, but there is new hardware that needs to be deployed, and some of that is caught up in the supply chain constraints globally. And so we are continuing to work to accelerate the implementation of these particular controller boxes and we look forward to sharing news on progress on that as well. We definitely have already experienced down conductors that have been identified by this equipment and de-energized automatically. We are seeing the benefits of it. But it\u2019s on a smaller scale than EPSS where we have it 100% deployed. So, in the coming months, we will share more about the deployment and the completion of the installation of that hardware.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: You\u2019re welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. Throughout the call, you highlighted that the AB 1054 and the August 31st deadline for pending legislation within the state, given that we are nearing a deadline, are there any other processes or legislation, legislative bills that could be introduced at the last minute here as we work towards the deadline?\nPatti Poppe: We are \u2013 I am happy to report that our team is very engaged in Sacramento, has a good pulse on what\u2019s coming. And at this stage, bills have had to have been introduced. There is procedurally, it\u2019s now an abandonment can be added to an existing package, and so we have to be on the lookout for that. But we don\u2019t have any alarm bells on the horizon at this stage.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then on the undergrounding effort, what progress has the company made on RFPs and other contracting efforts for undergrounding packages over the last few months?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. We are not complete on the selection of our final partners that we will be selecting, but we will definitely make that public when we do. I am happy to report we have already underground more miles of line this year than we did in the entire year last year. So, we have accelerated our capabilities and the team is just continuing to make great progress.\nRyan Levine: And then last question for me. In terms of the engagement with Victims Trust, you highlighted your recent meeting, but in terms of the overall cadence or pace of engagement has it started to pick up with the change in leadership of the organization, or have things been relatively consistent over the last six months to nine months?\nPatti Poppe: I would say it\u2019s been consistent, but maybe over the last six months. I would suggest that we have had a lot of conversations in the last six months, helping the trust to understand what\u2019s happening with the equity price, why it is, what it is and what we can do together to really serve the victims best.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, I will turn the conference back over to Patti for any closing remarks.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Regina. Well, thanks, everyone. We know it\u2019s a busy day for you. And as I said in my prepared remarks, something special is happening here at PG&E, and we can feel the momentum. And I really hope you are feeling it, too. Have a great afternoon. Be safe out there.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti. We are on track to deliver our financial commitments this year. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2022 to 2026 earnings per share CAGR of 10% and reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. As Patti mentioned, I am pleased to share that we just issued $3.9 billion of our rate neutral securitization bond at a weighted average rate of 5.05%. Our transaction completes a critical element of our reorganization financing plan, with a total of $7.5 billion of securitization bonds now issued. This contributes to our focus on near-term efficient financing. The recent actions by both S&P and Fitch on our credit ratings reflect increasing confidence in our plans to make the investment our customers need and affordably finance our system enhancement. This morning, I want to cover three key areas, where we are laser-focused on mitigating financial risk and delivering predictable outcomes for you, our investors. First, a recap of our second quarter and first half financial results and a reiteration of our full year guidance; second, a deeper dive into our results ownership center and how we are using that to execute from a simple and affordable model; and finally, a few highlights on important regulatory and legal matters. Slide 9 shows our second quarter and first half results. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.25 ended $0.55 for the first half of the year. We recorded non-GAAP core income of $536 million for the second quarter of 2022. This income keeps us on pace to hit the common stock dividend reinstatement eligibility criteria by mid-2023. Moving to Slide 10, our first half EPS growth is on target at $0.55, up $0.05 or 10% from last year. You can see our rate-based growth of $0.03 per share in the first half and another $0.04 projected for the second half, a clear reflection of our investments in customer priorities. Please also note our favorable cost performance of $0.04 so far and another $0.02 to $0.04 planned for the second half. Combined, this tracks nicely to our roughly $200 million or 2% non-fuel O&M reduction plan. What you do not see here in our yearly forecast are risks due to pension costs that we manage on behalf of our coworkers. Due to our longstanding pension recovery mechanism approved by the CPUC, we do not see an impact to earnings even with the current market volatility. There are other changes, including our regulatory agenda as well as tax and other items. And combined, this shows how we are delivering on our at least 10% EPS growth this year, consistent progress to deliver for our customers and investors. As shown next on Slide 11, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP core EPS of $1.07 to $1.13. We are also narrowing and lowering our equity range for 2022 and are now forecasting $0 million to $250 million in equity needs for the year. As we resolve legacy claims, which I will talk about a bit later, we maintain our confidence that our equity needs will be limited this year. Let's move to our simple and affordable model. We adopted this model to help produce medium and long-term financial risk for both our customers and you, our investors. The model allows us to reduce risk for our customers holding down bill increases over time. And we will deliver on this model by using the lean operating system, which allows us to actively manage variability. It's about evaluating and executing against opportunities like putting lasting fixes instead of temporary repairs in the system, which helps avoid expense in costs that would otherwise flow through right away to our customers. Our efforts on this front give us greater confidence in our financial targets for the long-term. It starts with lean and how my coworkers are using these proven techniques to manage performance, reducing medium and long-term financial risk. Turning to Slide 13, for the past 8 months, we have been maturing our process to bring improved visibility and control to executing our work plans affordably in a room we fondly refer to as the ROC, short for the Results Ownership Center. On the left hand side of the slide, you can see the elements of visibility and control. In the ROC, we hold a weekly cross-functional operating review focused on our plan and performance against our financial targets. This is the same method we have used to consistently deliver on our operational goals for our Wildfire Mitigation Plan over the last year. You have heard Patti say, we split the details, so you don't have to. The ROC is where that statement comes to life. Additionally, we leveraged the 1-3-10 concept of visual management. Using consistently refreshed data, all attendees can tell within 1 second if our performance is on track; within 3 seconds, which way the metric is trending; and within 10 seconds, the recovery plan for any metric that is not on track. Managing all aspects of variability, as shown on the right hand side of the slide is how we deliver predictable results. When a key financial metric is off-track or trending off-track we identify it almost immediately, using current data, not month old or quarter old data. The conversation always includes who is doing what by when. And the resulting cash back plan will include a combination of short-term containment and long-term countermeasures. In addition to O&M and capital cost performance, our focus in the ROC this year has been on efficiencies in our contracted spending, evaluating productive time, expense to capital optimization that create lasting system enhancements for customers and internal staffing levels. Taking productive time, for example, in addition to the training rationalization Adam Wright discussed at Investor Day, we have also improved our time reporting this year based on an idea serviced at the ROC. Our coworkers in the field now explicitly report hours lost due to no work or work delays when they are not able to charge to a specific job. Having this data now readily available allows us to problem solve. Work delays can occur when a crew cannot access the customer's property, for example, but with good planning, we can enable that crew with a backup job. The simple change to our time reporting has uncovered a huge opportunity to increase productive hours. And just a 1% improvement translates to approximately 30,000 more productive hours per month. You can imagine we are excited about how this can translate into better outcomes for the hometowns we serve. This example, along with our focus on first-time quality that Patti spoke to, and many others, is how through the ROC, our entire enterprise owns our financial results and not just members of the finance team. Again, visibility and control provide predictable results. Our focus is on delivering that for you, our customers and our investors. Now I will cover the key regulatory legislative and legal updates for the quarter. Turning to Slide 14, at the top, as I mentioned in opening, we have now issued a full $7.5 billion in rate neutral securitization bonds. We have used those proceeds to payoff $5 billion of utility temporary debt and will payoff the remaining $1 billion in the first quarter of 2023 as that debt becomes callable. The remaining proceeds will go towards paying down short-term borrowings at the utility. Completion of the securitization was a key aspect of improving our balance sheet. And as a result, last week, S&P moved us to Stable outlook. And in June, Fitch Ratings revised their outlook, moving us from Stable to Positive. Keeping with the theme of securitization, as expected, on June 29, the CPUC issued a favorable proposed decision granting our request to securitize up to approximately $1.4 billion of eligible AB 1054 capital expenditures previously found reasonable in the 2020 GRC. We expect a final vote on this proceeding on August 4, which \u2013 that timing keeps us on plan to proceed with a bond issuance later this year or early 2023. These securitizations are an important aspect of our financing plan, a stronger balance sheet, improved credit ratings and reduced borrowing spreads. Moving down the slide. We made substantial progress resolving legacy securities' legal claims. The net impact we're reflecting this quarter is $145 million. We believe this is a constructive outcome within our forecasted equity needs. Additionally, in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and based on the status of discussions with certain subrogation entities and individual claimants, during this quarter, we recorded an incremental charge of $150 million for additional potential losses above available insurance. The movement you're seeing in this bucket of legacy claims demonstrates our commitment to putting these litigation matters in the rearview mirror. And we're making progress on these key legal matters while maintaining our focus on financing. As a reminder, we have now reduced and narrowed our 2022 equity needs range from $100 million to $400 million, down to a range of $0 to $250 million. Next on the slide, we summarize the status that are yet to be recovered wildfire-related spend. As you can see, we have approximately $5.2 billion outstanding at the end of the quarter. Of this amount, approximately $1 billion is approved for cost recovery in 2022 and 2023. Clearly, we still have more work to do, but just around the quarter in September, we plan to file our next WMCE application. And as a reminder, based on the CPUC schedule, we expect proposed decisions on both our 2020 and 2021 WMCE filings during Q4 this year. Together, these represent the majority of the $2.2 billion shown here as pending a final decision. And finally, at the bottom of this slide, we are highlighting our two outstanding cost of capital applications. The CPUC held oral arguments in the 2022 case last Friday, where we had a chance to reiterate our position that the cost of capital components should remain at pre-2022 levels for 2022. This month, the CPUC also issued a scoping memo in our 2023 cost of capital application. The commission accepted our request to include an updated cost of debt in September, which we think is constructive given where rates have moved. The schedule provides for a possible final decision of the CPUC last business meeting of the year on December 15. Before I move from key regulatory cases, just a brief update on the 2023 GRC for which we've requested a test year revenue requirement of $15.34 billion. On July 11, we submitted our rebuttal testimony responding to GRC proceeding stakeholders' comments and recommendations. We continue to defend our request and is the next step for evidentiary hearing starting on August 15. We expect a final decision in the third quarter of 2023. I'll close by reiterating that we're on track to deliver our 2022 financial targets, using proven tools and techniques to lean to deliver predictable results, mitigating financial risk. Our commitment is worth repeating again, non-GAAP core EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti. Good morning, Shar. Hi, Shar, it does. I think if you look at equity, what we've said is that really looking forward to getting some of these important legacy items behind us, which we were able to make progress on including this quarter. That helped us refine and really narrow our equity guide for the year. And that's really ultimately about a good financing plan that's looking a couple of years out at any point. We also got, as you mentioned, the rate neutral securitization completely done here by midyear, which was nice because, ultimately \u2013 we're initially unsure if we could get it all done at this point or if it was going to take us to the end of the year. And then on the debt side, ultimately, you've got a couple of things there, right? They are going to help us further simplify. First, we've got an 80 10 54 securitization. That's really our next one coming up that we're hoping to execute later this year or early next. And then along the same time frame, we're probably going to be looking at ongoing needs for long-term debt which really just finance our rate base growth, and that's consistent with our base financing plan. Thanks, Shar. Absolutely, Julien. And I think you said it that ultimately, our focus is going to be uncertainly where we're trading at this point to have to make the best economic decision we can. And so obviously, looking at the 5-year plan at this stage, and really the focus is consistently on making sure that we're putting these legacy items front and center because they are a driver for us. Specifically, you saw us resolve or make substantial progress and able to bound the securities claims right at $145 million. We're making progress on the Kincade related claims. And so we've got a much better focus now with the increase we had there quarter-over-quarter on where that will land as well. And as you can imagine, those are two key drivers. As you look in future years, we are going to have fewer implications on that front. We are going to have \u2013 obviously, the odd fire is completely covered by insurance at this stage. So you can imagine, Julien, that really our folks is going to be on making it right with these communities where we need to. That's going to be the core focus of the company. At the same time, we've got to actively manage our financing needs, which is I think what you're seeing in the results of this year and bringing down the range from $1 million to $400 million down to $0 to $250 million this quarter. That's accurate, Julien. At this stage, that was part of our prior agreement with the CPUC to fully depreciate the assets by the end of \u2013 we are talking in light of the second unit in 2025. We are also watching certainly the different pieces are moving on the state level. Patti did well that we are looking at the federal level. The state also has a resiliency fund that they are looking at. And additionally, you mentioned the specific piece of the legislation, including customer [indiscernible]. And certainly, I think that that's a good example of the legislature acting on behalf of our customers and helping to lower cost. And so certainly, there is a financing advantage for \u2013 in that for us as well. Michael, happy to take it. I think that there is that potential. At this stage, as you know, we recorded $1.15 billion total impact. And so that would imply that the $150 million here could interact with the wildfire fund itself. I just have to emphasize this could take some time. I think in the interim, what we are very focused on, including with an accelerated claims process in the community is making sure that we have impacted families paid quickly. So, at this point, we have got over 100 claims that have come forward in that way and that have allowed us to compensate impacted local communities quickly. So, that's the near-term. Over time, there is really the way to think about this is we have got our insurance layer itself, CPUC recoveries above that of roughly $360 million. You have got then FERC related recoveries of roughly $100 million. And then ultimately, the remainder will be tapping the wildfire fund. So, there could be time here before we really get to the stage of tapping the fund because the statute actually requires that you are substantially completed with your claims themselves before you move forward to the fund. I think in terms of the fact pattern and our operational prudency as it related to Dixie Fire, I think we have been quite clear that in terms of vegetation management, in terms of the management of our assets and the appropriate response. I think all of those things position us well for the recovery themselves at the various jurisdictions, including at the wildfire fund. Sure thing. So, there is two to keep in mind. The first would be personal injury statute of limitations, which runs from 2 years from the incident. And then property damage, which is 3 years. Those are the two primary drivers of claims and claims timing. Sure thing, Gregg. I think that this is going to be a key for the company over the next, really, 2 years, primarily with the majority of the funds coming in 2023 and 2024, and then help us from a cash flow perspective. The things to keep in mind are really two. First, quarter-over-quarter, the overall increase that you saw, a move of roughly $0.5 billion was directly related to prior vegetation management work that was critical for the system. Second thing to keep in mind is that we do have two important data points here that are expected in Q4, which is the resolution of both the 2020 Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Event or WMCE related account as well as the 2021. When you look at those two together, that's roughly the $2.2 billion that we have talked about. So, those are going to be key in terms of getting resolution there and then keeping us on track for our FFO guidance."

            "name": "Patti Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I will focus on three key areas today: first, our financial results; second, our continued work to build trust with policymakers and play our role as an enabler for California's prosperity; and third, I'll provide an update on our wildfire mitigation progress. Our results through the first half keep us on track to deliver our full year 2022 non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.13. We have got the system in place to manage the inevitable pluses and minuses. The system provides confidence that we will deliver our commitment of at least 10% non-GAAP core EPS growth through 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. As a result of further progress on legacy items, our rate neutral securitization and good cash management, we are lowering and narrowing our equity guidance. We are projecting a need of $0 to $250 million for the remainder of the year. We are on the right path to mitigate financial risk and deliver the consistent results you can expect from PG&E. We are continuing to build trusting relationships with policymakers and work with them on outcomes that are good for our customers and allow us to deliver the energy they want safely and reliably. Earlier this year, Governor Newsom reached out to ask us to evaluate keeping Diablo Canyon open beyond its scheduled retirement in 2024 and 2025 to support the capacity and liability of the state's electric supply system. We are exploring the possibility of keeping this plant open for California's benefit. It is not an easy option and it will require much coordination between the state, multiple regulatory bodies and PG&E as well as many others impacted by the outcome of this decision. We of course are motivated to be of service to the people of California and our policymakers and we will continue to work with the state regarding the future of Diablo Canyon and to ensure reliability. I am very thankful to our team at the plant for continuing to remain focused on safe and excellent operations as the conversation and decisions move forward. We are also continuing to work with legislators on Senate Bill 884. The amended language in the undergrounding bill provides a supportive framework for PG&E to follow long-term undergrounding plan, which is good for customers and investors, because it allows us to build a more robust plan for labor, the lowest cost contracts and provide the fastest path to eliminating the highest risk and moving reliability at the same time on our power lines. I am pleased with the relationships we are building with these key policymakers in California. We are proud to be recognized as essential to California safety and clean energy goals. Our ability to continue to demonstrate the turnaround of PG&E enables long-term relationships built on mutual benefit and prosperity. Just this week, we filed our final responses in the review of our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. We welcome the healthy dialogue with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety and we believe our responses address their concerns, make our plans stronger and make our communities safer. We look forward to a draft decision on our Wildfire Mitigation Plan by the end of September. Given the dry conditions we have seen in our service area in 2022, I thought I'd spend some time discussing our wildfire mitigation tools described on Slide 5. As a result of the significant work that we have completed since 2019, combined with the protocols we have implemented for our EPSS and PSPS programs, we estimate that we have mitigated more than 90% of the wildfire risk in our service area. Our approach to catastrophic wildfire mitigation is driven by multiple layers of protection, starting with vegetation management, enhanced inspection and our longer term system hardening work anchored by our undergrounding plans. While we continue to make progress on our longer term mitigations, we layer in EPSS and PSPS to mitigate risk today. Our situational awareness capability, which we have built over the past 3 years, including installation of our high-definition cameras, the use of enhanced technology in our hazard awareness and warning center, and the expertise of our safety and infrastructure protection team, allow for better coordination and faster response should emission occur, providing our final layer of protection. The 90% risk mitigation today is informed by the results we are seeing in operations. For example, on the circuits where we have implemented our EPSS program, we have observed significant reductions in reportable ignitions and the acres impacted per ignition this year are significantly lower despite very dry conditions. We are continuing to pursue opportunities to improve beyond the 90% risk mitigation with additional innovative technology solutions such as partial voltage SmartMeter alarms' inbound conductor capability. We anticipate that additional opportunities, including undergrounding, will provide us with greater long-term protection while reducing the customer impact. As you can see on Slide 6, the Fire Potential Index guides our wildfire mitigation efforts. Most of the damage in recent years have occurred under R3 and higher conditions. In recent years, we have experienced more acres and structures damaged due to fire spread driven by fuels and terrain. To mitigate the fuels and terrain driven risk, in 2022 we have enabled EPSS for all fire potential conditions across all our high fire risk areas, except under conditions of heavy fog, high humidity and precipitation. Historically, nearly all of the acres and structures burned during extreme wind events. For these conditions, categorized as R5 and higher, we rely on our PSPS program. I talked a lot about mitigating physical risk today. As I know, this is a key area of concern given the impact of climate change across California and the rest of the world. As you have heard, we have the right system in place to keep our co-workers and our customers safe from physical risk and a mindset that has us continuously improving that system everyday. Please be assured that the team and I are also continually focusing on mitigated financial risk. We know our customers are experiencing major inflationary impacts outside of utility bills. And at PG&E, we are planning to keep costs down even as we invest in our system by utilizing our simple and affordable model. I am going to focus on the non-fuel O&M cost reduction line you see here on Slide 7. I am never short on stories and this quarter is no different. Here is the simple example of an opportunity we came across in our inspection work. People often think it will cost more to do high-quality work. I beg to differ. Last year, due to multiple verification methodologies between our vegetation management pre-inspectors and our work verification team, we had a 40% rejection rate on tree inspections, resulting in a crew coming back out to correct the miss. We cut that rejection rate by half already this year by adopting a uniform technology-driven inspection process, saving almost $100 million. Better first-time quality is more affordable. One example of many such opportunities, we are just getting started here and there is a long runway of opportunities across the entire enterprise that the team is learning to uncover. On the financing front, we successfully completed our rate neutral securitization bond issuance in July using the proceeds to pay-down temporary utility debt to strengthen our balance sheet. Importantly, S&P moved our outlook to stable after the rate neutral issuance. We are following through on our commitment to you, our investors, to delever our balance sheet and reduce financing costs for our customers, a real-time demonstration of our simple and affordable model in action. Finally, let's turn to our report card, which you can see here on Slide 8. We chose these metrics to show you where our focus is, delivering consistent outcomes through 2022 and beyond by building on our culture and our capabilities. One metric I want to highlight is our CPUC reportable emissions greater than or equal to 100 acres in high fire-threat areas. Fires this size are a small percentage of ignitions, but account for more than 90% of the acres burned and more than 95% of the structures damaged from 2015 to 2021 in our service area. We have zero CPUC reportable admissions over 100 acres so far in 2022. You will recall that in early June, PG&E filed an electric incident report on the old fire, which was 570 acres with no reported serious injuries, fatalities or structural damage. We filed the EIR as required, because Cal Fire collected our equipment and there was media attention. However, we are not recording this as a CPUC reportable admission at this time as we are not aware of any damage to our equipment at Cal Fire's suspected ignition point. Cal Fire is continuing their investigation on the cause of the fire and we will review the final report when it's available and the associated recordability accordingly. In addition, last week, the Oak Fire started in Mariposa County. After the time of the reported ignition, we de-energized lines for firefighter safety at the request of Cal Fire. Based on our review of our data, we are not aware of any information suggesting our facilities were involved in the ignition. We have not filed an EIR and Cal Fire continues their investigation into the cause of the fire. We do want to take this opportunity to thank our firefighters in the broader first responder community for working so hard to keep our communities safe. Physical and financial risk reductions are the building blocks that enable predictable results for customers and investors. I feel good about progress to-date. With that, I will hand it over to Chris to provide a deeper dive into our financial and regulatory items. Thank you, Chris. As we move through 2022, we're focused on minimizing physical and financial risk. Our layers of protection start with system inspections, repairs, vegetation management, overhead hardening and our 10,000-mile undergrounding program, which provide long-term sustainable climate-resilient infrastructure. In the near-term, additional layers of protection are provided by engineered enhanced power line safety settings when fuel risk is high and our public safety power shutoff program during high wind events. Our coordination with local and statewide agencies and situational awareness and fast response continues to strengthen and reduce our physical risk and provide a final and essential layer of protection. To mitigate financial risk for customers and investors, we will continue to fully deploy our simple and affordable model. I'm pleased with the progress as I see our relationships and trust growing with policymakers and stakeholders here in California. PG&E is an essential contributor to California's prosperity. We will keep an eye on the horizon and ensure we're making the right investments to deliver California's clean energy future. Something really exciting is blossoming here at PG&E. We feel the momentum, and we hope you do too. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Good morning, Jonathan. Yes. Jonathan, first of all, as we talk about EPSS, let's just step back for a second and remember that the objective was to end catastrophic wildfire. That's the objective of the program. And for that, we have layers of protection, EPSS being one of them. So on EPSS effectiveness, we're in the 70-plus range right now as we've gotten a larger sample size, and obviously, conditions are very challenging here in California, we feel good about that 70% because in concert with the 70% plus ignition reduction, the acres burned per ignition is dramatically lower in the plus 65% range. And so we feel like that is a really important sign of progress. And in fact, we're working on a new metric, Jonathan. It's not ready for prime time, but what we're looking at is sort of an ignition times acres burned. And as we look back on previous years, we've seen significant improvement. We look at that, all of that driving towards the elimination of catastrophic wildfire. The other thing I'll share on EPSS effectiveness that we feel good about is the duration of those outages has dropped dramatically year-over-year. In fact, we set a target for ourselves of 240 minutes, and we are well under that year-to-date. And so our operations team has done an extraordinary job responding to this new configuration of a system that, frankly, no one else in the industry at this scope and scale has this sort of safety measure in place. And we continue to have successful conversations with communities who are most impacted by EPSS. In fact, Pismo Beach is a good example a community down by San Luis Obispo was experiencing multiple outages. Our engineering team went and studied that circuit was able to make repairs and modifications and engineering improvements to significantly reduce the outages. And so we held webinars with the community and the local leaders gave us very positive feedback about our responsiveness. And so we just continue to be focused on our hometowns and making sure that we're keeping everybody safe. Yes. Thanks, Shar. Well, it's great because undergrounding and affordability go hand-in-hand. Undergrounding is a great example of our simple and affordable model at work, where we're going to be able to transition from a highly expense-intensive vegetation management program to more permanent corrective action, which is undergrounding the lines. As you may remember, when we filed our modification to the GRC, we added $7 billion of capital first couple of years of the undergrounding plan, and offset with $1 billion of expense reduction, resulting in a flat \u2013 no modification essentially to the rate increases of that ask. And so \u2013 we think it's an important combination. I'll just say we're really pleased with the progress on the undergrounding bill. I think it shows a couple of things. Number one, our customers have been demanding that we invest in our infrastructure. I've seen so many quotes and headlines about PG&E, underinvested in its infrastructure. This is our pathway to investing in the infrastructure to keep our people safe and have a climate resilient energy system. Our legislators see the same thing. And they are working with us. Senate Bill 884 is making progress. We like the current draft. There is still \u2013 it's still a live ball, I would say. There is still modifications that can be made, and so we're continuing to work closely. But we like the idea that there is clarity to a long-term plan and clarity that the legislature expects us and will hold us accountable to completing this undergrounding plan. We want that, too. And so that accountability then translates into a 10-year plan and the OEIS and the CPUC are directed to review and approve that in a timely fashion, which allows us to save the most dollars for our customers. It allows us to do that massive infrastructure project at the most affordable price. It gives us the opportunity to better long-term contracts, better access to equipment at a lower cost, Staffing up a labor workforce to deliver that incredible infrastructure project. And so I just feel like undergrounding is such a perfect example of the simple affordable model at work and making the system safe. Thanks, Shar. Thanks, Julien. So Julien, obviously, Diablo Canyon is very much on our minds. And so if we step back and just think about what is being discussed here and what the path forward is, first of all, it's \u2013 we continue to remind all engaged parties that the clock is ticking here. we've got a real sense of urgency in order to transition from being in a decommissioning posture to a life extension posture. So the most important thing to us right now is that we get certainty on the decision-making. We have to secure tasks. We have to order fuel. There is some very near-term items that \u2013 actions that we would need to take if, in fact, we changed the posture of the plant. And so with that, we're working very closely with the state first to understand what are the needs and what do we need to do to forward. This is not an easy option. Legislation will have to be passed. The permitting and relicensing of the facility is complex. And so there is a lot of hurdles to be overcome in order to move forward. However, we like the fact that, that plant's value is being recognized by the state that there seems to be kind of a shift in the attitude about the role that nuclear can play in a GHG-free economy. And so obviously, our team at Diablo continues to do great work and earn the respect of the citizens of California and the policymakers as well. We do think that the DOE funding is a possibility. And certainly, the state has expressed interest in maximizing that and making sure that Diablo Canyon gets included in the DOE's program to extend the life of nuclear. Again, nationally, I think there is been a real shift in attitude about the value of these baseload nuclear facilities. And so given that, we're just going to continue to work through the financials, and that will be second to making sure that the plant is ready and safe and able to operate for the state. Thanks, Julien. Yes. So legislation \u2013 we believe legislation \u2013 and it's pretty well agreed that the legislation is required in order to change the permitting and relicensing time line. And so the legislature is \u2013 needs to pass any new laws by the end of April, April 30, and then they are signed by the governor in September. And so that really drives an important deadline for us. And in addition to the fact that we need to order cast and the fuel \u2013 and so given that the combination of that timing really does drive the decision-making. Yes. We are implementing new technologies as we speak, literally. In fact, when we look at the utilization of our smart meter technology to its full potential, it can identify risks and faults on the system, and we are already implementing that system-wide. So, that's an additional layer of protection. Another layer of protection is on our secondary lines or down conductors. We have new settings that we can utilize and some new technology in a controller box that we are deploying out to the system as we speak. So, what I can tell you is every single day, we have a technology team who is focused on ending catastrophic wildfire. Our team at our advanced technology center, ATS, they are working night and day to come up with new and better technologies to deploy. So, we are not waiting, you can rest assured. And as the quarters progress, we will continue to share progress on those additional layers of protection that we are putting in. Yes. Thanks. Yes. We feel good about the current draft. Some of the things that we did not like about the previous drafts have been removed. I think it was important for our legislatures \u2013 legislators and the authors of the bill to understand how important it was that the financial mechanisms be in place, so we can attract the high-value capital to fund the program. We know it's important to you to have certainty for your clients to make sure that those moms and pops who invest their money in a utility can count on a predictable return. And so I think that was a really good understanding that we formed there. So, the language is good about cost recovery, the permitting assistance as well as especially the legislative direction to OEIS and the CPUC to support a 10-year plan, which would be outside the general rate case. An infrastructure project of this scope and scale is so important, it would be longer term. So, we can get the labor force ready, we can get the equipment ready, we can get the long-term contracts. That will save our customers the most money. We can do the program at the lowest total cost when we have that longer term plan. And so having visibility transparency and frankly, accountability to \u2013 for us to do what we said we are going to do and to get the unit cost where we want the unit cost. I think it's in the best interest of everyone to have this kind of legislative direction to provide the certainty that we need. And just to remind you on timing, August 31 is the deadline for bills to be passed and sent to the governor. And then September 30 is the last day the governor can sign a bill. And so that will be the timing of that legislative activity. Yes. In fact, Nick, I was in Washington, D.C. 2 days ago, in fact, with a small group of CEOs focused on this climate package, encouraging its inclusion in this new program. And it's amazing to me how much can happen in two days. And so we are excited about clean energy components of the package. We think that it will allow us to continue to grow the clean energy assets here in California by a variety of owners, not just the utility, but making sure that we have got that clean energy transition at the most economic and lowest societal cost. We are excited about the inclusion of hydrogen and the standalone storage credits. We are studying the implications for the EV credits, but it looks like the cap is being proposed to be lifted, which would be good and important here in California because EVs are such an important part of our future. Of course, like I would suppose most businesses, we don't love the corporate minimum tax. For us, it is a pass-through, which is why we don't like it. It puts affordability pressure directly on our customers. And so there is obviously a lot of discussion about that. We will continue to work our simple and affordable model, however, and we will ride that rollercoaster so you don't have to. We will make the necessary adjustments to continue to build our funding, our infrastructure for our customers as they would wish and lower costs in a variety of areas, if, in fact, that additional cost gets borne by our customers. Yes. Nick, thanks for asking the question. I had a very productive conversation with the new administrator, Cathy Yanni. She is a professional. She has been in this business for many \u2013 well, her whole career, and she was very impressive to me. I was happy to have a chance to talk with her. We clarify \u2013 I clarified for her that we want what they want. We want to maximize the value of this agreement that was made on behalf of victims. And obviously, our stock price has an impact on that and their actions with the volume of shares that they own have an impact on the stock price. And so we talked about that, and we talked about how working together could be very beneficial to the victims and that's our sole focus. And again, we want what they want, to make it right. And we obviously think working together with them is more productive than working independently. However, they have been clear that they want to make sure that they get certainty around the dollars that they will have available to distribute to victims. And if you check their website, you can see they have made a significant progress in disbursing funds. She is very focused on doing that efficiently and effectively, and so certainty helps them. Bottom line, we want what they want, and we will look forward to continuing to work with them. Thanks Nick. Good morning Gregg. I \u2013 the ball is really in their court. They own the stock, and it's up to them how they want to disperse it. Good morning David. Yes. So, we are continuing to look at that. We definitely see continued load growth. It's lower at this early part of our 5-year plan. At the latter part of the 5-year plan and then going into the 10-year plan, we see significantly more forecast. It will be interesting to see if the additional incentives on EVs accelerate adoption here in California. But as we have said, 1% to 3% is in our long-term forecast. Well, the partial voltage detection through our smart meters is deployed. That is deployed as we speak. And so, we are learning a lot as we get those partial voltage alarms. We have a 60-minute response time. We are trying to narrow that into even less than that, so we can get out and observe the situation and find out if it is in fact unsafe. And so in the coming months, you will get more \u2013 we will share more insights with you on what we are learning there. Again, that's an infrequent occurrence, but it is an occurrence. And then the down conductor, I think has a ton of potential. It does require new hardware. Some of the hardware that we have on the system can be reprogrammed and so we are doing that as we speak, but there is new hardware that needs to be deployed, and some of that is caught up in the supply chain constraints globally. And so we are continuing to work to accelerate the implementation of these particular controller boxes and we look forward to sharing news on progress on that as well. We definitely have already experienced down conductors that have been identified by this equipment and de-energized automatically. We are seeing the benefits of it. But it's on a smaller scale than EPSS where we have it 100% deployed. So, in the coming months, we will share more about the deployment and the completion of the installation of that hardware. You're welcome. Thank you. We are \u2013 I am happy to report that our team is very engaged in Sacramento, has a good pulse on what's coming. And at this stage, bills have had to have been introduced. There is procedurally, it's now an abandonment can be added to an existing package, and so we have to be on the lookout for that. But we don't have any alarm bells on the horizon at this stage. Yes. We are not complete on the selection of our final partners that we will be selecting, but we will definitely make that public when we do. I am happy to report we have already underground more miles of line this year than we did in the entire year last year. So, we have accelerated our capabilities and the team is just continuing to make great progress. I would say it's been consistent, but maybe over the last six months. I would suggest that we have had a lot of conversations in the last six months, helping the trust to understand what's happening with the equity price, why it is, what it is and what we can do together to really serve the victims best. Thank you, Regina. Well, thanks, everyone. We know it's a busy day for you. And as I said in my prepared remarks, something special is happening here at PG&E, and we can feel the momentum. And I really hope you are feeling it, too. Have a great afternoon. Be safe out there."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pacific Gas & Electric Corporation First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call.  [Operator Instructions]. Matt Fallon, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference\nMatthew Fallon: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for PG&E's first quarter earnings call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's first quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures.  The presentation can be found online, along with other information at investor.pgcorp.com. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. With that, I'll hand it over to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that we earned $0.30 in non-GAAP core EPS in the first quarter, and we're on track to deliver our 2022 non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.13. We believe in delivering at least 10% EPS growth for you as investors, this year, next year and the following year and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026, putting any annual surplus performance to work for important customer needs, a win for customers and investors.  We're underway on my second year here at PG&E with a world-class purpose-driven team focused every day on the triple bottom line, serving people, the planet and California's prosperity. We'll deliver on our triple bottom line by mitigating physical risk and by mitigating financial risk as seen here on Slide 4.  We're changing the culture and building new capabilities at PG&E. Our culture is shifting to one of service and performance. We're rebuilding our team's confidence that we will deliver for our hometown. We will serve our planet, and we will lead with love. We've been enabling our leaders to challenge assumptions they have about how and why we do the work that we do. Our culture is an important ingredient in our turnaround here at PG&E. I'm very pleased with the progress that I'm seeing. For our customers and you, our investors, to believe that things have changed here at PG&E, my coworkers have to believe and experience the change themselves. One way to help people experience a new and improved PG&E on the inside is through building the capabilities of our team through our lean operating system. I learned long ago that the customer experience can be improved while we are reducing the cost to deliver.  In fact, they often go hand in hand. Improving our work processes takes all of us every day using our visual management tools and our daily, weekly and monthly operating review cadence to manage our performance. We can then identify our gaps and deploy problem solving to address them and set new standards to prevent reoccurrence of the problems. By changing our culture and building our lean capabilities, we're enabling the mitigation of physical risk and financial risk. On wildfire, we're confident that we have the right tools in place to mitigate this risk through EPSS and PSPS as well as making our system safer every day with our extensive inspection program and vegetation management work.  And we're ramping up our ultimate solution, our undergrounding program which is designed to permanently reduce physical risk on our highest risk miles. To mitigate financial risk, we're planning to keep customer costs down even as we invest in our system by utilizing our simple and affordable model. And to further mitigate financial risk, we're also focused on paying down debt and delivering on our 5-year non-GAAP core EPS CAGR of 10%. This premium return is driven by our simple and affordable model being on Slide 5. There are many opportunities for us in 2022 and beyond that allow us to invest in necessary and high-value improvements to our electric and gas energy system while reducing the cost to deliver.  Let me share an example of the simple affordable model in action. At the end of February, we filed an update to our 2023 general rate case. In the update, we've included the additional $7 billion of capital for our undergrounding plan through 2026 and and an offsetting $1 billion in expense, resulting in a similar revenue level to what we filed in our initial application last summer. We have confidence in our ability to execute these efficiencies due to the use of our lean operating system. For example, as a result of the first year of using lean to drive our vegetation management work we achieved a roughly 16% reduction in program unit costs.  This is a big deal. We can make our systems safe with the right investments and keep customer bills affordable that benefits both customers and investors. It is not complicated. In addition to mitigating financial risk with our simple and affordable model, we're mitigating physical risks for our customers.  As I mentioned, we plan to make enhanced power line safety settings capable on all circuits in our high fire risk areas this year. As a reminder, on the circuits where we enable these settings in 2021, we saw an 80% reduction in CPUC reportable ignitions. This is the first time we have seen any material reduction in ignition since we have been tracking them.  Also, we'll continue to utilize public safety power shutoffs when we encounter dangerous and extreme weather conditions, building on improvements we made in 2021. When we backcast our power shutoff protocols, our analysis shows that we would have prevented 96% of the structures damaged from 2012 through 2020 from catastrophic wildfires. To inform our PSPS protocols, we use billions of data points including PG&E's 31-year weather climatology study to forecast hourly probability of large and catastrophic fires.  In addition, we leveraged hundreds of millions of fire spread stimulations each day to help inform our PSPS protocols. Our PSPS algorithms use state-of-the-art machine learning models to increase predictive capability. The technology and data science that underpins our PSPS capabilities is extraordinary. We know shutting off power cannot be a permanent solution. Therefore, 2022 is an important and exciting year for us to learn from our experience in the field on undergrounding our lines.  There's a lot of support and interest in our undergrounding plans. In fact, both the California State Senate and State Assembly have legislation focused on utility undergrounding this session. Senate Bill 884 and Assembly Bill 28 89 were recently passed out of their respective legislative energy and utilities committees. This is good progress. We're optimistic that the legislature will work toward a solid solution that's good for customers and attract the investor capital needed to vary the risk. We actually have a new thing around here. How do you rebuild PG&E? From the underground up and we are on our way.  Turning to Slide 7. You and my coworkers have heard me talk about leading with love. Many people wonder what is that? Leading with love. Let me give you an example. At PG&E, my coworkers are responsible for keeping themselves and each other safe on the job. While we improved our DART performance, which is a measurement of injuries on the job in 2020, we knew we could be even safer in 2021.  I'd like to say, even after best-ever performance, we are still dissatisfied. We found that by utilizing the simple plays from our ClearSky lean playbook, we were able to problem solve and prevent injuries with simple and effective action plans every day.  We reduced our DART rate by 25% in 2021 relative to 2020. And as you can see here on Slide 7, we continue to improve this year, which reflects a 75% injury rate reduction since 2019. Coworker safety is where a culture change must start.  Teaching people how to deliver and enabling them to believe in their own capability that is leading with love. Another example of the culture shift we are causing here involves our permitting team. I will never forget about a year ago at our first undergrounding planning session, we asked our permitting team what would have to be true to bury 10,000 miles of line. Everyone kept saying that permitting would be impossible. Our permits team stood up and declared. We are not going to be the problem, give us a solid long-term plan and we can get the permits. Come to us a day or a couple of weeks before we need the permit and then we have a problem. It is so true. Everything hinges on solid, long-term plans and well-designed workflow. We all know great plans to deliver predictable outcomes.  As we've started to scale the underground program, we've already seen improvements in our permitting process cycle times, something that will set us up for success as we double the miles every year in the next couple of years. Specifically, we've seen an almost 50% reduction in the time it takes to produce and receive approval for detailed design drawings. Our first major underground project took 13 months to design and receive subsequent approval from local agencies, 13 months. Through a focus on implementing standard repeatable processes inside of PGME based on agency feedback and by building associated skills, we've reduced the review and approval time there to 5 months. That is real progress. We are making it right and making it safe at PG&E. I can't think of a better way to lead with loves than that.  Before I hand it over to Chris, I'll end with our report card, which you can see here on Slide 8. We chose these metrics to show you where our focus is, culture and capability delivering consistent, predictable outcomes through 2022 and beyond. One metric I want to hit is our annual CPUC reportable ignitions in our high fire risk areas. The reason this metric is important is because fires over 100 acres accounted for 97% of the structures damaged in our service area from 2015, 2021. We have our eyes and our efforts focused on this one.  Moving on in the report card. As you can see, as of quarter end, we're on track to hit our annual 2022 targets. Specifically, we're happy to report that we're on track with our miles underground to date target. We varied 41 miles against a plan of 34 year-to-date and are picking up speed. Now I'll hand it over to Chris to cover our financial and regulatory items.\nChristopher Foster: Thank you, Patti. As Patti referenced on the report card slide, we are on track to deliver our 2022 financial commitments. Today, we're reaffirming our 2022 to 2026 earnings per share CAGR of 10% and also reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. This morning, I'll cover 3 areas which tie directly to our focus on mitigating financial risk.  First, our positive financial results. Second, how we're putting the simple, affordable model Paddy mentioned into practice with a few key examples. And finally, our progress on key regulatory and legal matters. Even with the financial impact from the legal items, our 2022 equity guidance remains the same at $100 million to $400 million.  Slide 9 shows the results for the first quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.30. We recorded GAAP income of $475 million, including noncore items for the first quarter of 2022. This means we've recorded cumulative positive GAAP earnings of $253 million for the most recent 4 consecutive quarters, which means we have met the eligibility requirements for S&P 500 index inclusion.  On Slide 10, we show the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $0.23 per share for Q1 2021 versus $0.30 per share for Q1 2022. EPS increased by $0.03 due to cost reductions in the first quarter, $0.02 of benefit were derived from rate base growth and timing of taxes contributed $0.02 quarter-over-quarter.  As we experienced some timing benefit in the quarter, overall results were in line with our expectations, and our first quarter results put us on track to hit our full year 2022 guidance. Moving to Slide 11. We're reaffirming our non-GAAP core EPS of $1.07 to $1.13.  As you can see here, our 2022 equity guidance remains $100 million to $400 million. As Patti mentioned in late February, we filed updated testimony in our 2023 generate case and our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. In the update, we included the capital for roughly 1/3 of our undergoing program as well as the additional expense from the expansion of our EPSS program, offset by a reduction in vegetation management and other expense across the business.  The impact of the increase in undergrounding miles is included here on Slide 12 and reflected in our approximately 9% rate base CAGR. Next, I'll cover some specific examples of the simple affordable model we've adopted that will help reduce financial risk for customers and you, our investors, for the medium and long term.  Here on Slide 13, we're providing a purely illustrative view of how our targeted 2% nonfuel O&M reduction can be achieved. For example, we are reducing costs from our suppliers as shown in the indicative $150 million here. We will externally source nearly $11 billion this year to execute our core work. But our focus is on efficient purchasing of materials and support, employing solid industry practices rather than unnecessarily unique standard and stabilizing our requirements with longer-term contracts. We value our supplier partners, and they are an important part of our team and they'll benefit for more certainty to produce more efficient outcomes. We are also reducing on costs this year and in the coming years through modifying our work to shift from quick repairs to more permanent improvements. This means moving on at a customer experience all at once to capital work with cost recovery over a longer period. To give you a sense of the long-term opportunity, our 2020 CapEx to O&M ratio was roughly $0.90 compared to the industry average closer to $1.40.  You can bet that we have our eye on that benchmark. We're already using our leading capabilities to stabilize and improve our work planning to drive meaningful improvement. Examples I just covered are important for us for over the next 10 years, but I want to emphasize that incremental improvements are happening now. This year, we are implementing a new scheduling and dispatch platform and some functionality is already being deployed to frontline supervisors and it's allowing for daily visibility for work assignments.  Supervisors confirm what work is going out each morning, and what is getting completed by the end of the day. Automated reports will be leveraged to show crew productive time and the related mix of capital versus expense. You've heard us talk about visual management as part of our lean operating system. This is putting it to work to manage a portfolio of over $3 billion a year.  Already this year, we've seen quantifiable improvements in our work execution. While our gas maintenance and construction crews have historically performed mostly expense work, they are now averaging approximately 40% in capital. We have a number of smart ways to do our work better, more affordably. You'll hear more about these cost reduction programs at our Investor Day this June.  Before moving off this slide, I want to point out that there's also a big cost increase shown here. Costs go up every year. And as we enter a period of high inflation, we're planning on it. The cost savings we're focused on are large enough to offset these increases and deliver a net savings of 2%. Now I'll transition to a few key regulatory and legal updates. Earlier, I referenced our equity needs are unchanged. On the debt side, we're focused on meeting our debt paydown commitments.  To that end, I'm pleased to share that the final legal steps have been resolved on our rate neutral securitization request, and we are on track. We intend to price a first series in the next few days. As a reminder, we have CPUC authorization to issue a full $7.5 billion program in up to 3 series. The proceeds of these bonds will primarily go towards paying down $6 billion of temporary utility debt. This transaction was designed to improve PG&E credit metrics, and we look forward to fully executing this important piece of the financial plan. We've also filed an application to issue our second series of AB 1054 authorized wildfire mitigation capital expenditure securitization. We expect a decision in that proceeding later this year.  This is an important opportunity to finance critical wildfire risk mitigation work at affordable rates for customers. Along with our deleveraging efforts, our focus on balance sheet health also includes timely recovery of wildfire-related spend.  Turning to Slide 14. In the first quarter, the CPC issued a final decision on our 2018 CMA case, and we anticipate collecting that outstanding balance over a 12-month period for the terms of the settlement agreement. Cost recovery of another approximately $2 billion of previously incurred wildfire-related spend is pending a final decision from the CPUC. We are expecting proposed decisions in both of our outstanding Wines cases in the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of historical wildfire impacts, we continue to make good progress on important legacy legal matters. Earlier this month, we announced that we reached settlement agreements to resolve legal proceedings around the 2019 Kincade Fire and the 2021 DCF. As a result of these agreements, criminal charges for the Kincade fire are dismissed and the relevant district attorneys will not pursue criminal charges for the Dixie fire. While we have long stated, we do not believe these fires were the result of criminal conduct, this is a constructive outcome that enables us to continue to invest in making our systems safer every day. As I mentioned earlier, these settlements have not changed our equity guidance for 2022.  Additionally, our previously recorded liabilities for estimated third-party claims for the 2018 Zog fire, the 2019 10-K fire and the 2020 Dixfire have not changed during the first quarter. And we are also engaged in settlement efforts to dissolve the securities claims that rode through the Chapter 11 process. Next, I'll cover a brief update on our cost of capital applications pending at the CPUC. In our outstanding 2022 application, we demonstrated extraordinary events warning and departure from the cost of capital mechanism and argue that the cost of capital components should remain at the pre-2022 level.  Separately, on April 20, we filed our 2023 cost of capital application. We are requesting an 11% return on equity. Consistent with the details in our application, we believe this ROE is fair and necessary. We've made the case that this reflects an appropriate return on equity for PG&E which reflects a higher risk premium, driven by our current credit rating and the substantial stock discount we trade at relative to our peers.  On the FERC side, in mid-March, we received a decision on our TO 2018 filing, as well as a favorable Nice Circuit Court decision, providing support for our 50 basis point California-specific adder. We have filed for rehearing on the TO 2018 case. These outcomes only impact prior periods. As a reminder, our FERC approved current return on equity through 2023 is 10.45%.  I'll close by reiterating that we're mitigating financial risk by delivering stable financial results. Non-GAAP core EPS growth of at least 10% per year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're on track to deliver our 2022 financial targets while also running the business with a focus on the long term. We'll continue to make the right investments for our customers, both in terms of risk mitigation and affordability. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Chris. As we move through 2022, you can see how we are squarely focused on minimizing physical risk and financial risk. System resiliency, including our 10,000-mile undergrounding program provides long-term sustainable wildfire risk mitigation. In the near term. We continue with our engineered enhanced power line safety settings where fuel risk is high and our public safety power shutoff program during high wind events. Ultimately, we are investing in a hardened system that is resilient to the effects of climate change. To mitigate financial risk for our customers and our investors. We will continue to make the right investments affordably. We're focused on creating the culture and the capability we need, allowing us to execute on these operational and financial imperatives.  We'll keep an eye on the horizon and ensure we're making the right investments to deliver California's safe, reliable, resilient and clean energy future. That's the way we serve customers and you, our investors. On a final note, many of you came to see us last August in California this June, we're coming to see you. We hope you can join us at our Investor Day on Friday, June 10, in New York City. We look forward to seeing you there. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: Patti, just a question on undergrounding. I know you obviously highlighted the legislative initiatives that are out there. zeroing in particular to 884, there's obviously some questionable constructs proposed like earnings deferral. I mean, we appreciate that it's kind of early in the session. But do you see a need for legislative improvement? And is this Senate bill in palatable would you even spend capital with this bill? And if the bill makes it out of the chamber at all, do you see that as a setting sort of a bid ask for negotiations or some sort of a construct later on? So just maybe more specific thoughts there.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Obviously, it's top of mind, Shar, and we appreciate the question. And you said it, it is early, that's the bottom line on this. I'm learning about the California legislative process, but I am assured that there's lots of opportunity for us to find a great outcome. The good news is people love undergrounding. So we're happy that the customers and our communities are responding very favorably to our proposals, and we're happy to see the progress that the team is delivering. And so I'm very confident very confident they're going to find a pathway to a really good outcome. And I'll say that even in Senate Bill 4, there are some good elements there about permitting and partnership with telecom.  There's a lot that could really be assisted legislatively. But I will also add that our plan doesn't contemplate legislation. Our plan stands on its own, and we certainly can make good progress without any legislation. And so we'll be working closely with key policymakers to make sure it's a great outcome for customers and investors.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. And then just one last one on the wildfire victims fund. I mean, obviously, we saw the fund going to market with shares twice this year. there were some perceptions of need for maybe improved alignment after the first tranche was sold, which obviously didn't happen.  Do you get a sense that the fund doesn't see a need to align a coal market with PG&E maybe from a political standpoint after these deals. I mean, at this point, do you think it's fair to assume continued selling when we see positive news from PCG post lockup periods. And have there been any like opportunities for refreshed conversation or feedback with the fund?\nChristopher Foster: Shahriar, it's Chris. There's a lot there. Let me just kind of try to tackle the different pieces there. So just in terms of where we are at this point. So from the company standpoint, PTs completed all the cash payments to the trust of about $6.75 billion. The total so far, the trust has sold about 100 million shares. So call that roughly another $1.2 billion. And at this stage, we certainly think it could be advantageous if the company has the opportunity to co-market alongside them for a public offering. And so there's very open communication lines there. And I know there's a lot of interest here in the selling patterns of the trust. I'd just say the trust really has its own fiduciary interests. And they're going to independently make those decisions on whether and when and how they're going to sell the stock. But I do want to emphasize, Shahriar, we've had that dialogue and provided the trust advisers really with some of the investor feedback following the recent sales, and we're absolutely ready to cooperate under the terms of the registration rights agreement that we've got. Because ultimately, the focus here, as you can imagine, is on -- for them and for our investors is to continue to focus on is going financial risk mitigation, and that's going to provide clear value to really all parties here. So we've got a lot of alignment at its core.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: So just on the -- sorry to ask on the same topics, and it tends to be a popular one. The -- there was these stories the last week or 2 about a potential involvement of the trust seeking like a loan from the California government, I guess, to deal with getting cash instead of directly selling shares. Is there any update in that process? And -- is that something that you're involved in at all? Or -- yes.\nChristopher Foster: Steve, I'm happy to take it. is tough to speculate, as you can imagine on where some of that would eventually land. I think there's kind of 2 different concepts at high levels that have been discussed that we've certainly seen in the media. The first would be this concept of would there be the potential to tap the wildfire fund itself. We've obviously got concerns about that, as you can imagine, for purposes of the importance of the fund being there as a backstop for all Alon utilities. The second alternative more recently that was referenced in terms of a potential loan from the state in order to provide more time and more growth for the company's underlying stock value.  Again, tough to know if there's explicit traction there. Again, I would say, certainly, our state is in a budget surplus position but just tough to know where that will land specifically. I think our focus has been more on educating and ensuring that there's alignment on the fact that the wildfire fund itself, it's important to protect that as a foundational tool for downside risk for all California utilities.\nSteven Fleishman: Great. Other question is just the new -- we've had the 2 new commissioners now in place for, I guess, months now, and it's been very quiet, which is, I guess, kind of nice in California. But just maybe curious, any sense you're getting from the commission on priorities for the year? And they have a lot of different things on their plate just ranging from cost of capital to net metering to obviously, electrification and clean energy? So just any better sense of priorities of the new President and commission?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Well, as we've said before, Steve, we are very grateful to have talented and capable commissioners. And Alice and John were 2 great additions to the commission based on their experience and their knowledge of California energy and energy challenges. And so what we expect is their priorities are very much aligned with our own. Affordability is obviously an important topic here in California. And I think nationally as inflation is starting to pressure families affordability is an impure topic, which is what makes our simple and affordable model so important.  And it will be great for us to be able to build trust with the commission when they start to see the simple and affordable model in action as they were able to see in this GRC update that we made that showed that we could invest in undergrounding, reduce expense and keep the request about the same. That was the first sort of, I would say, public example of that simple and affordable model in action. And so we do look forward to working with the commission on making sure that our energy is affordable, safe, reliable and resilient. And so as you said, there's a lot of priorities and I'm convinced that the commission is very capable to deal with those priorities as is the team here at PG&E.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research Partners.\nJonathan Arnold: A quick one on undergrounding, could you maybe give us an update on efforts to secure sort of federal and/or other funding out by your customers? Just -- and then just how you think about that as part of the plan? Is it a way to get more safety for the same bill impact or accelerate? Just how we should think about that as you contemplate that?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, Jonathan, great to hear your voice. We are -- we think that it's quite reasonable to expect that we'll be able to attract the capital to fund the undergrounding efforts. This filing that we made, the update to the GRC cannot be understated what we -- the message we were able to send in numbers, in dollars and cents. In fact, we can invest in undergrounding with our new capability that we're building to reduce cost here at the company.  So there's a real opportunity for us to continue to demonstrate that external funding sources are not required to deliver this. Now that's not to say that we would object if somebody wanted to help contribute things related to other parts of the wildfire expenses, for example, if there was external funding for vegetation management or some of the expense-related issues associated with our wildfire plans, I think that would be something that we were very interested in talking to people about. But we think the undergrounding investment is the right investment for customers and we can offset the cost through the expense reductions.  The other thing I'll point to is something Chris talked about in his prepared remarks, this ratio of capital to expense and what opportunity there is here at PG&E to get that ratio more in line with benchmarks. When we're at a capital to O&M ratio of 0.9, that means that we don't have the ratio right compared to benchmarks at 1.4 million. So we really think that undergrounding is a good example of how you can shift from the expense laden spending that we've been doing shift to a more permanent fix that is good for customers, a safer solution, a longer-term permanent solution investing that capital.  We think you -- the investment community and others will appreciate the value of that, and that's an important message for us to continue to send here in California and demonstrate the value of that getting that ratio right.\nJonathan Arnold: Great. And could I also ask on just thoughts around the timing for getting into parent debt reduction. I think you have a commitment that runs out through the end of '23, but should we think of that as being something that get going once securitization starts to get going? Or is it kind of more out towards the end of the window?\nChristopher Foster: Jonathan, it's Chris. I think ultimately, we're definitely focused on the $2 billion reduction by the end of 2023. Haven't been too specific beyond that, but I would just generically consider the rate neutral component, an important milestone as we go. And again, as I mentioned, we're actually really in parallel today in the market on that rate neutral securitization as well.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Perfect. And did I see a number of $3 billion that you're out with now or?\nChristopher Foster: Yes. I would think about in terms of that filing, I think about that as a floor, Jonathan. Ultimately, what we're trying to do there and what I mentioned on the call, the prepared remarks is that we're substantially oversubscribed. Really what we're trying to do, as you can imagine, is find that balance between the fact that we've got the flexibility to do these 3 series and also make sure that we keep in mind knowing the market backdrop that is volatile, to get a good amount in in this first series but also balance customer affordability, which is just going to be key.\nOperator: Your next question is from Julian Dumoulin of Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin: Just following up here on the cost of capital, I saw the prepared remarks but -- just curious if you can talk a little bit more on the accretion side as one of your peers has talked about asking for an increase there. Just did you guys talk about risks, whether that's the CCA or on wildfire concerns, et cetera. Why not touch both variables here, not just the ROE component but also the equity ratio here?\nChristopher Foster: Sure, Julien. And as you can imagine, we've got both the 2022 cost of capital adjustment mechanism being contemplated but also 2023. You're specific, I think, pointing to the 2023 filing, we did maintain the consistent capital structure there. And ultimately, what you saw in terms of our 11% ROE request, it was directly reflective of what we had filed even last year as we contemplated the update to the 2022 case.  So what we're expressing there is consistency across cases of what we're seeing in terms of ongoing risk to the enterprise, necessitating both 11% ROE, but also maintaining the cap structure itself. As you probably also thought a moderate increase to long-term debt to 4.27%, which we think is reasonable as well.\nJulien Dumoulin: Got it. All right. And then just -- can we talk a little bit about the upcoming wildfire season and the risk profile there. Obviously, we've seen some comments about water availability in the state of late. But can you given the mix of your system improvements that you already identified in the prepared remarks and these projections for Water, can you talk about sort of the net and how you guys would frame your assessment for the summer?\nPatricia Poppe: Julien, it's such an important question and something that I really am thankful for our team and particularly a shout-out to all our engineers here at PG&E for the incredible work they've done I can't overstate the progress that has been made through the implementation of these engineered enhanced power line safety settings.  As we filed in our updated GRC and our wildfire mitigation plan, we've shown a dramatic risk reduction, a quantifiable risk reduction over 90% and that is a huge progress in 1 year. And so let me just hit a couple of high points about why that's true. One, these engineered settings, as we shared last year in the areas where we implemented them, we had an 80% reduction in ignitions. While this season, I'm so excited to report that we have already deployed and enable those enhanced power line safety settings in our entire high-fire threat area.  We'll be done by early next week. We did a review this week in our Wildfire command center and the engineers, we're very excited to share the progress they've made. But we're not stopping there. We're doing it in adjacent areas as well. And so we committed in our wildfire mitigation plan to have those adjacent areas done by August, but I'm happy to report, we're going to have that done in a matter of weeks, not months. And that is a very important safety backstop for our customers and being able to de-energize those lines with the contact of an animal, a tree, anything less than 1/10 of a second puts us on a new plane of safety and I just can't overstate the benefit of that to the system.  So for example, this year, we're utilizing all of these millions of simulations and data extracts that we have every day to determine, does the circuit need to be turned on today. We're thinking of this that there's no longer that we have to prepare for a wildfire season. We're going to be prepared every day, Julian. This team is going to be ready to go and we have information and data at already that allows us to make those decisions.  So for example, this year, we've already initiated EPSS on certain circuits under certain conditions, and we've had 27 outages on an EPSS-enabled circuit. In other words, we had enabled EPSS and something did, in fact, make contact with the line and it did, in fact, be energized, and we had 0 ignitions in all of those EPSS-enabled circuits. That is a safe risk-reduced system that is in play today. I couldn't be more proud of my engineers for the incredible work they've been doing night and day to make sure that our customers are safe, no matter the conditions.\nChristopher Foster: And then, Julian, if I could just build on that, I think Patty hit it really well. And what we're focusing on today, as you've heard, is both physical risk reduction of the system as well as financial risk. And the other key thing to think about there is that we've also now just last month completed the update to our wildfire-related insurance.  So for the period of, again -- basically, think about it as April this year to April of next year, we've got $940 million of Wilba-related insurance, too. So good protection there on really both sides. So risk reduction and financial risk reduction.\nPatricia Poppe: That's our Belton suspender solution.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Patty, Chris, have a system reliability and renewable question for you, which is you're very active as are your California peers in buying incremental solar and storage to meet summer peak demands. But there's a lot of solar and storage projects around the country that are facing delays, whether it's supply chain, whether it's part of the circumvention related case.  How are you thinking about it -- first of all, are some of the projects or many of the projects you've contracted for already off schedule that you're aware of? That's question one. Question 2 is if you have projects where you're the buyer of the power and it looks like they're going to be delayed. How do you backfill that for reliability purposes?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Great questions, Michael. Nice to hear your voice. We -- first of all, we're very comfortable about our supply situation for this summer for 2022 even if no additional storage comes online. And so we are already planned prepared. Our Moss Landing facility came online. That's 182 megawatts of storage that we're very excited about utility-owned storage. We are prepared for this summer.  But all that being said, you're right, there are supply chain deficiencies. And thankfully, we plan conservatively and are prepared -- we're prepared for that. But I don't think those supply chain issues are permanent. There's such market demand, the market will figure this out. Again, we're prepared for this summer. But as the coming years evolves, we know that storage is a critical complement to the renewable and clean energy ambitions of California, which is what made us so excited about our announcement with General Motors and Ford and our continued relationship with BMW on bidirectional charging vehicles.  We have 6,600 megawatts of capacity driving on the roads of PG&E service area today in the form of electric vehicles. Not a single kilowatt of those cars are powering back to the grid. That's a huge opportunity for us. In fact, that's 3 large power plants of capacity, driving around the roads of California, specifically our service area.  That, we think, is a really long-term ambition that we can optimize supply and demand and have a much smarter energy system, and our team is fortunate to be here in the Bay Area with the incredible commitment to clean energy, we can actually get back into a leadership position, leading the world in this clean energy transformation. And it's not going to be, I would say, the system of old, big bulk power delivering on large transmission.  I think we're going to have a lot more distributed resources that we're going to be able to enable and optimize demand. So we're pretty excited about what the future holds for us here.\nMichael Lapides: Okay. And then a follow up in a little bit of a regulatory question. Now that all 3 of the utilities in the state have filed their cost of capital proceedings for 2023. Do you think there's a potential scenario where you and the various intervenors could potentially come to a settlement between now and the year-end? Or do you think this has to go the fully litigated process?\nChristopher Foster: Michael, it's Chris. Good question. I think it's a little premature to know exactly how it would how it would play out. Ultimately, we've had a good track record in the state. I just have to say in terms of the timing. I think the commission recognizes the importance of the case is just for certainty purposes. And so certainly on cost of capital adjustment mechanism piece that one is a little bit less clear in terms of the calendar. But in terms of the 2023 to 2025 consideration, we have asked for a December 2022 decision. And I do think the commission has got a good track record of kind of generally keeping it around that time frame or early the subsequent year, just so that we know what we're heading into.  But tough for me to speculate, as you can imagine, specifically on settlement posture just where we are right now because we've really just filed, what, last week.\nOperator: Your next question is from Nicos Campana of Credit Suisse.\nUnidentified Analyst: So I guess a lot of things have been answered, but as it relates to just maybe the agencies, I'm sure you kind of met with them like everyone else this past quarter. Can you just kind of maybe update on some of the discussions you're having with them? What are they looking for in terms of just getting you back to IG if you kind of have any outlook in the plan here at this point? I know that there's going to be some material holdco debt paydown in '23, but maybe you can just talk to that a little?\nChristopher Foster: Sure. Happy to Nick. I think there's really 3 factors that they're looking at closely when we talk often. I think the first is certainly its highest order. Just how are we doing toward operational-oriented risk reduction and progress there? And I really mean that broadly across the enterprise, not necessarily just around wildfire risk. I think the second piece really relates to the level of alignment with both the state and our customers.  How are we making -- how are we looking in terms of progress on key regulatory cases, outcomes there? As well as ensuring that, frankly, some of the volume lessons around impacts that we're having to customers. And that's why we've got a tighter plan this year as it relates to our EPSS program. And then finally, it's hitting our core financials. I think ultimately, there are focus on the balance that you mean, and we've talked about consistently in terms of heading back to the FFO to debt guide that we've given of mid- to high teens in 2024 as well as starting down this path, right? I mean this is what's so key about our rate neutral securitization.  Again, that we're expecting to close this in May, we're in the middle of pricing here over the next few days. And that really starts that path, right? We're able to take out $6 billion of temporary operating company debt and really get back to here our regulated capital structure, so when you pull them together, it really is that combination. They want to see progress on the operational plan. We're going to be showing you and then that every quarter. Two, regulatory outcomes. We've got some key components up here in front of us, right, of our wildfire mitigation plan approval that's up here in front of us. How does the enhanced oversight process turned out and the progress we're making there in our vegetation management program. And then finally, like I said, hitting our core financial program, and we're definitely on track there as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from Greg Orrill of UBS.\nGregg Orrill: Just in terms of proving out the liability improvements for maybe 1054, can you talk about how you're thinking about the $2 billion of wildfire mitigation spend that you have pending and maybe also the regulatory asset around Dixi that you have? And if those are milestones or if there are other ones you're thinking about?\nChristopher Foster: Sure, Greg. Let me try to take both of those. They're definitely related in one way. I think one, if I'm hearing you right, it's specific to how we've been able to continue recoveries on prior wildfire investments. I do think you saw our disclosures today and the update is we continue to work our way, that $4 billion-plus down really quarter-over-quarter indicated this time that we've actually seen $1.25 billion come through in rates. So there's key progress already underway there. With regard to the Dixie related progress itself, again, the headline there is no explicit change to the charge itself.  What I would offer is in terms of thinking about when AB 1054-related considerations would come about. We have put forward a fast claims process as part of the settlement that we recently announced which would allow for a resolution of claims that come forward within 75 days. The only reason I'm offering that as an example is you could see us in one scenario start to accelerate some claims.  Keep in mind that we do have over $560 million of insurance to apply against that. But I'm just offering that to you, Greg, is a little bit of color for -- there could be a scenario here where we're able to accelerate some of these considerations to call the eventual question of recoveries in terms of FERC, the CPUC and eventually the wildfire fund itself.\nOperator: Next question is from Ryan Levine of Citi.\nRyan Levine: Congrats on the S&P inclusion qualification, with income. I guess 1 follow-up on that. Are there any near-term onetime items related to the legal cost securitization or trust sales that could impact the GAAP requirement in the upcoming quarters. There was, I guess, footnote 6 in your release had some data that suggested maybe?\nChristopher Foster: Sure, Ryan. I think in terms of looking forward, I think the example that would be there in terms of what we've consistently described as legacy legal claims would be explicit to the securities related items that rode through the Chapter 11 process. We did indicate that we are in discussions there. And so I think that is an item that we're currently evaluating.. What I want to emphasize there, though, Ryan, is that we've certainly come forward with our best information today in terms of where those discussions lie and those have not impacted our equity guide of $100 million to $400 million. So I just wanted to offer to you that we've got that level of insight there and this does not impact the financing guide that we've given for 2022. Hopefully, that helps in terms of a way to think about it need to be specific on the negotiation.\nRyan Levine: With the rate neutral securitization or Fire Victims Trust sale, given the Grane Trust decision from last year impact the GAAP income profile in the coming quarter?\nChristopher Foster: I mean it'd be tough to -- again, that would depend on whether the trust itself is selling. What we did disclose today is that there is a tax benefit that comes through this noncore. Thus far on the trust sales, I think we disclosed it at $135 million in terms of the 100 million shares that have been disposed so far.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then in terms of the Analyst Day in June, is there any color you could provide around what you're intending to communicate at that event?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, you bet, Ryan. You're not going to want to miss it. We have the opportunity to showcase this all-star team I know you had a chance to meet him when he came out in August last year, is an extraordinary team leading PCG, and we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to hear from them on things like our business process improvement, the wildfire technology that's underpinning our risk reduction here, our undergrounding plan, and certainly our simple and affordable model in more detail and any then regulatory implications and benefits as a result of that deployment of our simple and affordable model.  So really going deep on this physical and financial risk mitigation that we really want people to understand firsthand from our top leadership team here at the company.\nOperator: We have completed the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Patti Poppe for closing remarks.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Cheryl, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It's always a great opportunity for us to share with you the progress that we're making in the transformation of PG&E. The physical and financial risks continue to be reduced in meaningful ways, and we look forward to again sharing more with you about that at our June 10 Investor Day. Again, I'll be joined by this All-Star team, and I know you'll enjoy hearing from them directly about how all the things Chris and I have talked about today are coming to life. The culture and capabilities that we are building at PG&E create a sustainable, winning business model for this company, and we couldn't be more excited to be able to share that with you in June. We'll see you in New York.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti. As Patti referenced on the report card slide, we are on track to deliver our 2022 financial commitments. Today, we're reaffirming our 2022 to 2026 earnings per share CAGR of 10% and also reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. This morning, I'll cover 3 areas which tie directly to our focus on mitigating financial risk.  First, our positive financial results. Second, how we're putting the simple, affordable model Paddy mentioned into practice with a few key examples. And finally, our progress on key regulatory and legal matters. Even with the financial impact from the legal items, our 2022 equity guidance remains the same at $100 million to $400 million.  Slide 9 shows the results for the first quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.30. We recorded GAAP income of $475 million, including noncore items for the first quarter of 2022. This means we've recorded cumulative positive GAAP earnings of $253 million for the most recent 4 consecutive quarters, which means we have met the eligibility requirements for S&P 500 index inclusion.  On Slide 10, we show the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $0.23 per share for Q1 2021 versus $0.30 per share for Q1 2022. EPS increased by $0.03 due to cost reductions in the first quarter, $0.02 of benefit were derived from rate base growth and timing of taxes contributed $0.02 quarter-over-quarter.  As we experienced some timing benefit in the quarter, overall results were in line with our expectations, and our first quarter results put us on track to hit our full year 2022 guidance. Moving to Slide 11. We're reaffirming our non-GAAP core EPS of $1.07 to $1.13.  As you can see here, our 2022 equity guidance remains $100 million to $400 million. As Patti mentioned in late February, we filed updated testimony in our 2023 generate case and our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. In the update, we included the capital for roughly 1/3 of our undergoing program as well as the additional expense from the expansion of our EPSS program, offset by a reduction in vegetation management and other expense across the business.  The impact of the increase in undergrounding miles is included here on Slide 12 and reflected in our approximately 9% rate base CAGR. Next, I'll cover some specific examples of the simple affordable model we've adopted that will help reduce financial risk for customers and you, our investors, for the medium and long term.  Here on Slide 13, we're providing a purely illustrative view of how our targeted 2% nonfuel O&M reduction can be achieved. For example, we are reducing costs from our suppliers as shown in the indicative $150 million here. We will externally source nearly $11 billion this year to execute our core work. But our focus is on efficient purchasing of materials and support, employing solid industry practices rather than unnecessarily unique standard and stabilizing our requirements with longer-term contracts. We value our supplier partners, and they are an important part of our team and they'll benefit for more certainty to produce more efficient outcomes. We are also reducing on costs this year and in the coming years through modifying our work to shift from quick repairs to more permanent improvements. This means moving on at a customer experience all at once to capital work with cost recovery over a longer period. To give you a sense of the long-term opportunity, our 2020 CapEx to O&M ratio was roughly $0.90 compared to the industry average closer to $1.40.  You can bet that we have our eye on that benchmark. We're already using our leading capabilities to stabilize and improve our work planning to drive meaningful improvement. Examples I just covered are important for us for over the next 10 years, but I want to emphasize that incremental improvements are happening now. This year, we are implementing a new scheduling and dispatch platform and some functionality is already being deployed to frontline supervisors and it's allowing for daily visibility for work assignments.  Supervisors confirm what work is going out each morning, and what is getting completed by the end of the day. Automated reports will be leveraged to show crew productive time and the related mix of capital versus expense. You've heard us talk about visual management as part of our lean operating system. This is putting it to work to manage a portfolio of over $3 billion a year.  Already this year, we've seen quantifiable improvements in our work execution. While our gas maintenance and construction crews have historically performed mostly expense work, they are now averaging approximately 40% in capital. We have a number of smart ways to do our work better, more affordably. You'll hear more about these cost reduction programs at our Investor Day this June.  Before moving off this slide, I want to point out that there's also a big cost increase shown here. Costs go up every year. And as we enter a period of high inflation, we're planning on it. The cost savings we're focused on are large enough to offset these increases and deliver a net savings of 2%. Now I'll transition to a few key regulatory and legal updates. Earlier, I referenced our equity needs are unchanged. On the debt side, we're focused on meeting our debt paydown commitments.  To that end, I'm pleased to share that the final legal steps have been resolved on our rate neutral securitization request, and we are on track. We intend to price a first series in the next few days. As a reminder, we have CPUC authorization to issue a full $7.5 billion program in up to 3 series. The proceeds of these bonds will primarily go towards paying down $6 billion of temporary utility debt. This transaction was designed to improve PG&E credit metrics, and we look forward to fully executing this important piece of the financial plan. We've also filed an application to issue our second series of AB 1054 authorized wildfire mitigation capital expenditure securitization. We expect a decision in that proceeding later this year.  This is an important opportunity to finance critical wildfire risk mitigation work at affordable rates for customers. Along with our deleveraging efforts, our focus on balance sheet health also includes timely recovery of wildfire-related spend.  Turning to Slide 14. In the first quarter, the CPC issued a final decision on our 2018 CMA case, and we anticipate collecting that outstanding balance over a 12-month period for the terms of the settlement agreement. Cost recovery of another approximately $2 billion of previously incurred wildfire-related spend is pending a final decision from the CPUC. We are expecting proposed decisions in both of our outstanding Wines cases in the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of historical wildfire impacts, we continue to make good progress on important legacy legal matters. Earlier this month, we announced that we reached settlement agreements to resolve legal proceedings around the 2019 Kincade Fire and the 2021 DCF. As a result of these agreements, criminal charges for the Kincade fire are dismissed and the relevant district attorneys will not pursue criminal charges for the Dixie fire. While we have long stated, we do not believe these fires were the result of criminal conduct, this is a constructive outcome that enables us to continue to invest in making our systems safer every day. As I mentioned earlier, these settlements have not changed our equity guidance for 2022.  Additionally, our previously recorded liabilities for estimated third-party claims for the 2018 Zog fire, the 2019 10-K fire and the 2020 Dixfire have not changed during the first quarter. And we are also engaged in settlement efforts to dissolve the securities claims that rode through the Chapter 11 process. Next, I'll cover a brief update on our cost of capital applications pending at the CPUC. In our outstanding 2022 application, we demonstrated extraordinary events warning and departure from the cost of capital mechanism and argue that the cost of capital components should remain at the pre-2022 level.  Separately, on April 20, we filed our 2023 cost of capital application. We are requesting an 11% return on equity. Consistent with the details in our application, we believe this ROE is fair and necessary. We've made the case that this reflects an appropriate return on equity for PG&E which reflects a higher risk premium, driven by our current credit rating and the substantial stock discount we trade at relative to our peers.  On the FERC side, in mid-March, we received a decision on our TO 2018 filing, as well as a favorable Nice Circuit Court decision, providing support for our 50 basis point California-specific adder. We have filed for rehearing on the TO 2018 case. These outcomes only impact prior periods. As a reminder, our FERC approved current return on equity through 2023 is 10.45%.  I'll close by reiterating that we're mitigating financial risk by delivering stable financial results. Non-GAAP core EPS growth of at least 10% per year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're on track to deliver our 2022 financial targets while also running the business with a focus on the long term. We'll continue to make the right investments for our customers, both in terms of risk mitigation and affordability. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti. Shahriar, it's Chris. There's a lot there. Let me just kind of try to tackle the different pieces there. So just in terms of where we are at this point. So from the company standpoint, PTs completed all the cash payments to the trust of about $6.75 billion. The total so far, the trust has sold about 100 million shares. So call that roughly another $1.2 billion. And at this stage, we certainly think it could be advantageous if the company has the opportunity to co-market alongside them for a public offering. And so there's very open communication lines there. And I know there's a lot of interest here in the selling patterns of the trust. I'd just say the trust really has its own fiduciary interests. And they're going to independently make those decisions on whether and when and how they're going to sell the stock. But I do want to emphasize, Shahriar, we've had that dialogue and provided the trust advisers really with some of the investor feedback following the recent sales, and we're absolutely ready to cooperate under the terms of the registration rights agreement that we've got. Because ultimately, the focus here, as you can imagine, is on -- for them and for our investors is to continue to focus on is going financial risk mitigation, and that's going to provide clear value to really all parties here. So we've got a lot of alignment at its core. Steve, I'm happy to take it. is tough to speculate, as you can imagine on where some of that would eventually land. I think there's kind of 2 different concepts at high levels that have been discussed that we've certainly seen in the media. The first would be this concept of would there be the potential to tap the wildfire fund itself. We've obviously got concerns about that, as you can imagine, for purposes of the importance of the fund being there as a backstop for all Alon utilities. The second alternative more recently that was referenced in terms of a potential loan from the state in order to provide more time and more growth for the company's underlying stock value.  Again, tough to know if there's explicit traction there. Again, I would say, certainly, our state is in a budget surplus position but just tough to know where that will land specifically. I think our focus has been more on educating and ensuring that there's alignment on the fact that the wildfire fund itself, it's important to protect that as a foundational tool for downside risk for all California utilities. Jonathan, it's Chris. I think ultimately, we're definitely focused on the $2 billion reduction by the end of 2023. Haven't been too specific beyond that, but I would just generically consider the rate neutral component, an important milestone as we go. And again, as I mentioned, we're actually really in parallel today in the market on that rate neutral securitization as well. Yes. I would think about in terms of that filing, I think about that as a floor, Jonathan. Ultimately, what we're trying to do there and what I mentioned on the call, the prepared remarks is that we're substantially oversubscribed. Really what we're trying to do, as you can imagine, is find that balance between the fact that we've got the flexibility to do these 3 series and also make sure that we keep in mind knowing the market backdrop that is volatile, to get a good amount in in this first series but also balance customer affordability, which is just going to be key. Sure, Julien. And as you can imagine, we've got both the 2022 cost of capital adjustment mechanism being contemplated but also 2023. You're specific, I think, pointing to the 2023 filing, we did maintain the consistent capital structure there. And ultimately, what you saw in terms of our 11% ROE request, it was directly reflective of what we had filed even last year as we contemplated the update to the 2022 case.  So what we're expressing there is consistency across cases of what we're seeing in terms of ongoing risk to the enterprise, necessitating both 11% ROE, but also maintaining the cap structure itself. As you probably also thought a moderate increase to long-term debt to 4.27%, which we think is reasonable as well. And then, Julian, if I could just build on that, I think Patty hit it really well. And what we're focusing on today, as you've heard, is both physical risk reduction of the system as well as financial risk. And the other key thing to think about there is that we've also now just last month completed the update to our wildfire-related insurance.  So for the period of, again -- basically, think about it as April this year to April of next year, we've got $940 million of Wilba-related insurance, too. So good protection there on really both sides. So risk reduction and financial risk reduction. Michael, it's Chris. Good question. I think it's a little premature to know exactly how it would how it would play out. Ultimately, we've had a good track record in the state. I just have to say in terms of the timing. I think the commission recognizes the importance of the case is just for certainty purposes. And so certainly on cost of capital adjustment mechanism piece that one is a little bit less clear in terms of the calendar. But in terms of the 2023 to 2025 consideration, we have asked for a December 2022 decision. And I do think the commission has got a good track record of kind of generally keeping it around that time frame or early the subsequent year, just so that we know what we're heading into.  But tough for me to speculate, as you can imagine, specifically on settlement posture just where we are right now because we've really just filed, what, last week. Sure. Happy to Nick. I think there's really 3 factors that they're looking at closely when we talk often. I think the first is certainly its highest order. Just how are we doing toward operational-oriented risk reduction and progress there? And I really mean that broadly across the enterprise, not necessarily just around wildfire risk. I think the second piece really relates to the level of alignment with both the state and our customers.  How are we making -- how are we looking in terms of progress on key regulatory cases, outcomes there? As well as ensuring that, frankly, some of the volume lessons around impacts that we're having to customers. And that's why we've got a tighter plan this year as it relates to our EPSS program. And then finally, it's hitting our core financials. I think ultimately, there are focus on the balance that you mean, and we've talked about consistently in terms of heading back to the FFO to debt guide that we've given of mid- to high teens in 2024 as well as starting down this path, right? I mean this is what's so key about our rate neutral securitization.  Again, that we're expecting to close this in May, we're in the middle of pricing here over the next few days. And that really starts that path, right? We're able to take out $6 billion of temporary operating company debt and really get back to here our regulated capital structure, so when you pull them together, it really is that combination. They want to see progress on the operational plan. We're going to be showing you and then that every quarter. Two, regulatory outcomes. We've got some key components up here in front of us, right, of our wildfire mitigation plan approval that's up here in front of us. How does the enhanced oversight process turned out and the progress we're making there in our vegetation management program. And then finally, like I said, hitting our core financial program, and we're definitely on track there as well. Sure, Greg. Let me try to take both of those. They're definitely related in one way. I think one, if I'm hearing you right, it's specific to how we've been able to continue recoveries on prior wildfire investments. I do think you saw our disclosures today and the update is we continue to work our way, that $4 billion-plus down really quarter-over-quarter indicated this time that we've actually seen $1.25 billion come through in rates. So there's key progress already underway there. With regard to the Dixie related progress itself, again, the headline there is no explicit change to the charge itself.  What I would offer is in terms of thinking about when AB 1054-related considerations would come about. We have put forward a fast claims process as part of the settlement that we recently announced which would allow for a resolution of claims that come forward within 75 days. The only reason I'm offering that as an example is you could see us in one scenario start to accelerate some claims.  Keep in mind that we do have over $560 million of insurance to apply against that. But I'm just offering that to you, Greg, is a little bit of color for -- there could be a scenario here where we're able to accelerate some of these considerations to call the eventual question of recoveries in terms of FERC, the CPUC and eventually the wildfire fund itself. Sure, Ryan. I think in terms of looking forward, I think the example that would be there in terms of what we've consistently described as legacy legal claims would be explicit to the securities related items that rode through the Chapter 11 process. We did indicate that we are in discussions there. And so I think that is an item that we're currently evaluating.. What I want to emphasize there, though, Ryan, is that we've certainly come forward with our best information today in terms of where those discussions lie and those have not impacted our equity guide of $100 million to $400 million. So I just wanted to offer to you that we've got that level of insight there and this does not impact the financing guide that we've given for 2022. Hopefully, that helps in terms of a way to think about it need to be specific on the negotiation. I mean it'd be tough to -- again, that would depend on whether the trust itself is selling. What we did disclose today is that there is a tax benefit that comes through this noncore. Thus far on the trust sales, I think we disclosed it at $135 million in terms of the 100 million shares that have been disposed so far."

            "name": "Patricia Poppe",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that we earned $0.30 in non-GAAP core EPS in the first quarter, and we're on track to deliver our 2022 non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.13. We believe in delivering at least 10% EPS growth for you as investors, this year, next year and the following year and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026, putting any annual surplus performance to work for important customer needs, a win for customers and investors.  We're underway on my second year here at PG&E with a world-class purpose-driven team focused every day on the triple bottom line, serving people, the planet and California's prosperity. We'll deliver on our triple bottom line by mitigating physical risk and by mitigating financial risk as seen here on Slide 4.  We're changing the culture and building new capabilities at PG&E. Our culture is shifting to one of service and performance. We're rebuilding our team's confidence that we will deliver for our hometown. We will serve our planet, and we will lead with love. We've been enabling our leaders to challenge assumptions they have about how and why we do the work that we do. Our culture is an important ingredient in our turnaround here at PG&E. I'm very pleased with the progress that I'm seeing. For our customers and you, our investors, to believe that things have changed here at PG&E, my coworkers have to believe and experience the change themselves. One way to help people experience a new and improved PG&E on the inside is through building the capabilities of our team through our lean operating system. I learned long ago that the customer experience can be improved while we are reducing the cost to deliver.  In fact, they often go hand in hand. Improving our work processes takes all of us every day using our visual management tools and our daily, weekly and monthly operating review cadence to manage our performance. We can then identify our gaps and deploy problem solving to address them and set new standards to prevent reoccurrence of the problems. By changing our culture and building our lean capabilities, we're enabling the mitigation of physical risk and financial risk. On wildfire, we're confident that we have the right tools in place to mitigate this risk through EPSS and PSPS as well as making our system safer every day with our extensive inspection program and vegetation management work.  And we're ramping up our ultimate solution, our undergrounding program which is designed to permanently reduce physical risk on our highest risk miles. To mitigate financial risk, we're planning to keep customer costs down even as we invest in our system by utilizing our simple and affordable model. And to further mitigate financial risk, we're also focused on paying down debt and delivering on our 5-year non-GAAP core EPS CAGR of 10%. This premium return is driven by our simple and affordable model being on Slide 5. There are many opportunities for us in 2022 and beyond that allow us to invest in necessary and high-value improvements to our electric and gas energy system while reducing the cost to deliver.  Let me share an example of the simple affordable model in action. At the end of February, we filed an update to our 2023 general rate case. In the update, we've included the additional $7 billion of capital for our undergrounding plan through 2026 and and an offsetting $1 billion in expense, resulting in a similar revenue level to what we filed in our initial application last summer. We have confidence in our ability to execute these efficiencies due to the use of our lean operating system. For example, as a result of the first year of using lean to drive our vegetation management work we achieved a roughly 16% reduction in program unit costs.  This is a big deal. We can make our systems safe with the right investments and keep customer bills affordable that benefits both customers and investors. It is not complicated. In addition to mitigating financial risk with our simple and affordable model, we're mitigating physical risks for our customers.  As I mentioned, we plan to make enhanced power line safety settings capable on all circuits in our high fire risk areas this year. As a reminder, on the circuits where we enable these settings in 2021, we saw an 80% reduction in CPUC reportable ignitions. This is the first time we have seen any material reduction in ignition since we have been tracking them.  Also, we'll continue to utilize public safety power shutoffs when we encounter dangerous and extreme weather conditions, building on improvements we made in 2021. When we backcast our power shutoff protocols, our analysis shows that we would have prevented 96% of the structures damaged from 2012 through 2020 from catastrophic wildfires. To inform our PSPS protocols, we use billions of data points including PG&E's 31-year weather climatology study to forecast hourly probability of large and catastrophic fires.  In addition, we leveraged hundreds of millions of fire spread stimulations each day to help inform our PSPS protocols. Our PSPS algorithms use state-of-the-art machine learning models to increase predictive capability. The technology and data science that underpins our PSPS capabilities is extraordinary. We know shutting off power cannot be a permanent solution. Therefore, 2022 is an important and exciting year for us to learn from our experience in the field on undergrounding our lines.  There's a lot of support and interest in our undergrounding plans. In fact, both the California State Senate and State Assembly have legislation focused on utility undergrounding this session. Senate Bill 884 and Assembly Bill 28 89 were recently passed out of their respective legislative energy and utilities committees. This is good progress. We're optimistic that the legislature will work toward a solid solution that's good for customers and attract the investor capital needed to vary the risk. We actually have a new thing around here. How do you rebuild PG&E? From the underground up and we are on our way.  Turning to Slide 7. You and my coworkers have heard me talk about leading with love. Many people wonder what is that? Leading with love. Let me give you an example. At PG&E, my coworkers are responsible for keeping themselves and each other safe on the job. While we improved our DART performance, which is a measurement of injuries on the job in 2020, we knew we could be even safer in 2021.  I'd like to say, even after best-ever performance, we are still dissatisfied. We found that by utilizing the simple plays from our ClearSky lean playbook, we were able to problem solve and prevent injuries with simple and effective action plans every day.  We reduced our DART rate by 25% in 2021 relative to 2020. And as you can see here on Slide 7, we continue to improve this year, which reflects a 75% injury rate reduction since 2019. Coworker safety is where a culture change must start.  Teaching people how to deliver and enabling them to believe in their own capability that is leading with love. Another example of the culture shift we are causing here involves our permitting team. I will never forget about a year ago at our first undergrounding planning session, we asked our permitting team what would have to be true to bury 10,000 miles of line. Everyone kept saying that permitting would be impossible. Our permits team stood up and declared. We are not going to be the problem, give us a solid long-term plan and we can get the permits. Come to us a day or a couple of weeks before we need the permit and then we have a problem. It is so true. Everything hinges on solid, long-term plans and well-designed workflow. We all know great plans to deliver predictable outcomes.  As we've started to scale the underground program, we've already seen improvements in our permitting process cycle times, something that will set us up for success as we double the miles every year in the next couple of years. Specifically, we've seen an almost 50% reduction in the time it takes to produce and receive approval for detailed design drawings. Our first major underground project took 13 months to design and receive subsequent approval from local agencies, 13 months. Through a focus on implementing standard repeatable processes inside of PGME based on agency feedback and by building associated skills, we've reduced the review and approval time there to 5 months. That is real progress. We are making it right and making it safe at PG&E. I can't think of a better way to lead with loves than that.  Before I hand it over to Chris, I'll end with our report card, which you can see here on Slide 8. We chose these metrics to show you where our focus is, culture and capability delivering consistent, predictable outcomes through 2022 and beyond. One metric I want to hit is our annual CPUC reportable ignitions in our high fire risk areas. The reason this metric is important is because fires over 100 acres accounted for 97% of the structures damaged in our service area from 2015, 2021. We have our eyes and our efforts focused on this one.  Moving on in the report card. As you can see, as of quarter end, we're on track to hit our annual 2022 targets. Specifically, we're happy to report that we're on track with our miles underground to date target. We varied 41 miles against a plan of 34 year-to-date and are picking up speed. Now I'll hand it over to Chris to cover our financial and regulatory items. Thank you, Chris. As we move through 2022, you can see how we are squarely focused on minimizing physical risk and financial risk. System resiliency, including our 10,000-mile undergrounding program provides long-term sustainable wildfire risk mitigation. In the near term. We continue with our engineered enhanced power line safety settings where fuel risk is high and our public safety power shutoff program during high wind events. Ultimately, we are investing in a hardened system that is resilient to the effects of climate change. To mitigate financial risk for our customers and our investors. We will continue to make the right investments affordably. We're focused on creating the culture and the capability we need, allowing us to execute on these operational and financial imperatives.  We'll keep an eye on the horizon and ensure we're making the right investments to deliver California's safe, reliable, resilient and clean energy future. That's the way we serve customers and you, our investors. On a final note, many of you came to see us last August in California this June, we're coming to see you. We hope you can join us at our Investor Day on Friday, June 10, in New York City. We look forward to seeing you there. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Yes. Obviously, it's top of mind, Shar, and we appreciate the question. And you said it, it is early, that's the bottom line on this. I'm learning about the California legislative process, but I am assured that there's lots of opportunity for us to find a great outcome. The good news is people love undergrounding. So we're happy that the customers and our communities are responding very favorably to our proposals, and we're happy to see the progress that the team is delivering. And so I'm very confident very confident they're going to find a pathway to a really good outcome. And I'll say that even in Senate Bill 4, there are some good elements there about permitting and partnership with telecom.  There's a lot that could really be assisted legislatively. But I will also add that our plan doesn't contemplate legislation. Our plan stands on its own, and we certainly can make good progress without any legislation. And so we'll be working closely with key policymakers to make sure it's a great outcome for customers and investors. Yes. Well, as we've said before, Steve, we are very grateful to have talented and capable commissioners. And Alice and John were 2 great additions to the commission based on their experience and their knowledge of California energy and energy challenges. And so what we expect is their priorities are very much aligned with our own. Affordability is obviously an important topic here in California. And I think nationally as inflation is starting to pressure families affordability is an impure topic, which is what makes our simple and affordable model so important.  And it will be great for us to be able to build trust with the commission when they start to see the simple and affordable model in action as they were able to see in this GRC update that we made that showed that we could invest in undergrounding, reduce expense and keep the request about the same. That was the first sort of, I would say, public example of that simple and affordable model in action. And so we do look forward to working with the commission on making sure that our energy is affordable, safe, reliable and resilient. And so as you said, there's a lot of priorities and I'm convinced that the commission is very capable to deal with those priorities as is the team here at PG&E. Yes, Jonathan, great to hear your voice. We are -- we think that it's quite reasonable to expect that we'll be able to attract the capital to fund the undergrounding efforts. This filing that we made, the update to the GRC cannot be understated what we -- the message we were able to send in numbers, in dollars and cents. In fact, we can invest in undergrounding with our new capability that we're building to reduce cost here at the company.  So there's a real opportunity for us to continue to demonstrate that external funding sources are not required to deliver this. Now that's not to say that we would object if somebody wanted to help contribute things related to other parts of the wildfire expenses, for example, if there was external funding for vegetation management or some of the expense-related issues associated with our wildfire plans, I think that would be something that we were very interested in talking to people about. But we think the undergrounding investment is the right investment for customers and we can offset the cost through the expense reductions.  The other thing I'll point to is something Chris talked about in his prepared remarks, this ratio of capital to expense and what opportunity there is here at PG&E to get that ratio more in line with benchmarks. When we're at a capital to O&M ratio of 0.9, that means that we don't have the ratio right compared to benchmarks at 1.4 million. So we really think that undergrounding is a good example of how you can shift from the expense laden spending that we've been doing shift to a more permanent fix that is good for customers, a safer solution, a longer-term permanent solution investing that capital.  We think you -- the investment community and others will appreciate the value of that, and that's an important message for us to continue to send here in California and demonstrate the value of that getting that ratio right. Julien, it's such an important question and something that I really am thankful for our team and particularly a shout-out to all our engineers here at PG&E for the incredible work they've done I can't overstate the progress that has been made through the implementation of these engineered enhanced power line safety settings.  As we filed in our updated GRC and our wildfire mitigation plan, we've shown a dramatic risk reduction, a quantifiable risk reduction over 90% and that is a huge progress in 1 year. And so let me just hit a couple of high points about why that's true. One, these engineered settings, as we shared last year in the areas where we implemented them, we had an 80% reduction in ignitions. While this season, I'm so excited to report that we have already deployed and enable those enhanced power line safety settings in our entire high-fire threat area.  We'll be done by early next week. We did a review this week in our Wildfire command center and the engineers, we're very excited to share the progress they've made. But we're not stopping there. We're doing it in adjacent areas as well. And so we committed in our wildfire mitigation plan to have those adjacent areas done by August, but I'm happy to report, we're going to have that done in a matter of weeks, not months. And that is a very important safety backstop for our customers and being able to de-energize those lines with the contact of an animal, a tree, anything less than 1/10 of a second puts us on a new plane of safety and I just can't overstate the benefit of that to the system.  So for example, this year, we're utilizing all of these millions of simulations and data extracts that we have every day to determine, does the circuit need to be turned on today. We're thinking of this that there's no longer that we have to prepare for a wildfire season. We're going to be prepared every day, Julian. This team is going to be ready to go and we have information and data at already that allows us to make those decisions.  So for example, this year, we've already initiated EPSS on certain circuits under certain conditions, and we've had 27 outages on an EPSS-enabled circuit. In other words, we had enabled EPSS and something did, in fact, make contact with the line and it did, in fact, be energized, and we had 0 ignitions in all of those EPSS-enabled circuits. That is a safe risk-reduced system that is in play today. I couldn't be more proud of my engineers for the incredible work they've been doing night and day to make sure that our customers are safe, no matter the conditions. That's our Belton suspender solution. Yes. Great questions, Michael. Nice to hear your voice. We -- first of all, we're very comfortable about our supply situation for this summer for 2022 even if no additional storage comes online. And so we are already planned prepared. Our Moss Landing facility came online. That's 182 megawatts of storage that we're very excited about utility-owned storage. We are prepared for this summer.  But all that being said, you're right, there are supply chain deficiencies. And thankfully, we plan conservatively and are prepared -- we're prepared for that. But I don't think those supply chain issues are permanent. There's such market demand, the market will figure this out. Again, we're prepared for this summer. But as the coming years evolves, we know that storage is a critical complement to the renewable and clean energy ambitions of California, which is what made us so excited about our announcement with General Motors and Ford and our continued relationship with BMW on bidirectional charging vehicles.  We have 6,600 megawatts of capacity driving on the roads of PG&E service area today in the form of electric vehicles. Not a single kilowatt of those cars are powering back to the grid. That's a huge opportunity for us. In fact, that's 3 large power plants of capacity, driving around the roads of California, specifically our service area.  That, we think, is a really long-term ambition that we can optimize supply and demand and have a much smarter energy system, and our team is fortunate to be here in the Bay Area with the incredible commitment to clean energy, we can actually get back into a leadership position, leading the world in this clean energy transformation. And it's not going to be, I would say, the system of old, big bulk power delivering on large transmission.  I think we're going to have a lot more distributed resources that we're going to be able to enable and optimize demand. So we're pretty excited about what the future holds for us here. Yes, you bet, Ryan. You're not going to want to miss it. We have the opportunity to showcase this all-star team I know you had a chance to meet him when he came out in August last year, is an extraordinary team leading PCG, and we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to hear from them on things like our business process improvement, the wildfire technology that's underpinning our risk reduction here, our undergrounding plan, and certainly our simple and affordable model in more detail and any then regulatory implications and benefits as a result of that deployment of our simple and affordable model.  So really going deep on this physical and financial risk mitigation that we really want people to understand firsthand from our top leadership team here at the company. Thank you, Cheryl, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It's always a great opportunity for us to share with you the progress that we're making in the transformation of PG&E. The physical and financial risks continue to be reduced in meaningful ways, and we look forward to again sharing more with you about that at our June 10 Investor Day. Again, I'll be joined by this All-Star team, and I know you'll enjoy hearing from them directly about how all the things Chris and I have talked about today are coming to life. The culture and capabilities that we are building at PG&E create a sustainable, winning business model for this company, and we couldn't be more excited to be able to share that with you in June. We'll see you in New York."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. And welcome to the PG&E Corporation Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Call. I would now like to welcome Jonathan Arnold, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin the call. Jonathan, over to you.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today\u2019s earnings presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the year ended December 31, 2023. With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. This morning we reported full year core earnings of $1.23 delivering at the high end of our annual guidance range. This result represents growth of 12% over our 2022 results of $1.10. In the fourth quarter we recognized the full year benefit of our 2023 general rate case as expected. I\u2019m also pleased to announce that we exceeded our 2% annual nonfuel O&M savings target for the second consecutive year with savings coming in at 5.5% and pushing our EPS to the high end of the range. Because these savings were predominantly generated by reducing waste and improving service, they benefit customers today and benefit investors for years to come. Looking to 2024, we are reaffirming our at least 10% growth target which is now based on our actual 2023 results of $1.23. This results in an increase to our 2024 core earnings guidance range with a new higher midpoint of $1.35 versus our previous guidance of $1.33. We also reaffirm our commitment to at least 9% core EPS growth for both 2025 and 2026, re-based off our actual 2023 results in our new 2024 range. In addition, I'm pleased to share that we're extending our core EPS growth guidance of at least 9% for an additional two years through 2028. Our needed customer investment leads to strong rate-based growth, which continues to be the primary driver of our future earnings growth. We're providing you with updated five-year forecasts for both rate-based and CapEx in today's slides. These numbers now extend to 2028 and show a consistent compound annual growth rate of 9.5% using the new base year of 2023. Finally, we reaffirm our commitment to no new equity in 2024 and remain committed to pursuing the most efficient forms of financing available for 2025 and beyond, which Carolyn will discuss in her remarks. On slide four, we've added 2023 actuals illustrating our high end of guidance results and the rebasing of forward year growth rates now through 2028. This is our simple, affordable model in action. The list in 2023 reflects our 5.5% non-fuel O&M reduction well above our 2% plan. Slide five is a reminder of the key elements of our simple, affordable model, which allows us to continue growing customer capital investment at 9% or more while containing customer bill increases at or below assumed inflation in the 2% to 4% range. Key enablers in the model are ongoing annual non-fuel O&M reductions of 2%, efficient financing, and electric low growth in the 1% to 3% range. The proof is in the numbers. The simple, affordable model works. You first saw slide six during our November business update call. This version has been updated for a few additional known items, such as the 2024 cost of capital trigger. Our new ROE of 10.7% took effect on January 1st this year, with collections beginning this month in gas rates and next month for electric. Delivering on this projected 2% to 4% bill growth trajectory is an essential element of the PG&E plan, and one which will be important for building trust with our customers over the long run. For our average gas and electric residential customer, average monthly bill increases are limited to the 2% to 4% range from 2023 through 2026. I wanted to be clear that this includes the step up in 2024 as we implement the GRC and other deferred cost recoveries. Our plan shows average bills stepping down, beginning later this year and further in both 2025 and 2026, keeping the average annual increase in the lower half of the 2% to 4% range as catch-up recoveries roll off. Two of the larger items are around $1 billion of 2022 WMCE interim rate relief, which comes off bills in mid-2024, and the 24-month collection of our first-year GRC revenues, which come off at the start of 2026. Let me say that again. Based on what we know today, our bills will rise at the lower half of the range, around 2.5% per year on average for the duration of this rate case from 2023 through 2026. Let's shift gears to the significant progress the team has made on risk mitigation. Slide seven updates our 2023 admission data for the full year. Total CPUC reportable admissions came in at 65% for 2023, down 68% from the 2017 baseline, and 29% down from 2022. On the right side of the slide, we're showing our weather normalized ignition rate, which is a metric from our wildfire mitigation plan. This year's number of 0.93 was a reduction of 71% from 2017, and our lowest annual number since we began calculating this metric. The metric demonstrates that we continue to drive down wildfire risk in 2023, even after adjusting for fewer circuit mile days under our three or higher conditions when the risks of catastrophic wildfire are highest. While we're extremely pleased with these results, our team certainly isn't stopping here. We see further opportunities to drive overall wildfire risk reduction beyond the 94% achieved in 2023, as we continue with additional system hardening and deployment of new technologies. In addition to the physical risk reduction, financial risks are also lower, including key protections under AB 1054, which were reaffirmed with the issuance of our annual safety certificate last month. Looking forward, here on Slide eight, we want to take a moment to highlight how we see PG&E offering investors a truly differentiated, high-quality utility growth story. This starts with premium rate-based growth and industry leading 9.5%. What sets us apart is our commitment to make this investment affordable for our customers. The key enabler is our ability to drive consistent non-fuel O&M savings as we deploy our lane operating system in a utility, which previously saw cost compound at an annual 10% rate over the prior five years. As a reminder, several years of doing whatever was necessary to respond to back-to-back crisis pushed our capital-to-expense ratio far below the industry average. This is where we have a wealth of opportunity and a long runway to drive efficiencies with sustainable savings benefiting both our customers and our investors. We expect future load growth related to California's leadership and electrification to be a further differentiator and one which will help keep customer build growth within our 2% to 4% forecast. In addition to continued adoption of electric vehicles throughout our service territory, we have seen a three-fold increase in data center applications in 2023 versus the prior four years. We plan to speak more about these load growth trends over the course of this year, including at an investor meeting which we are planning for June 12th in New York, so please mark your calendars for that. The fundamental differentiators of rate-based growth, O&M savings, and load growth, we would add our constructive state regulatory and policy environment in California. Key elements of the California regulatory model include four years of revenue certainty under the GRC, returns which are set separately from the GRC including a formulaic adjustment mechanism, and timely recovery for pass-through of important cost categories including fuel and pension. With our GRC resolved, we now have revenue certainty extended through 2026, giving us the best level of regulatory visibility we've had since I joined PG&E and something which any regulated utility would love. This brings me to our performance playbook, including our lean operating system, which is becoming a critical differentiator for PG&E as we continue building a sustainable culture based on continuous improvement and what we refer to as breakthrough thinking. And so, on slide nine, to my story of the month, or in this case, the story of the year. Let me first take you back to the beginning of 2023. We had a goal to underground 350 miles of electric lines at a unit cost of $3.3 million per mile. We started 2023 with only about five miles of civil construction fully complete. At that point, we had hundreds of miles still to design, thousands of individual easements to negotiate, 345 miles of trenches to dig, and 350 miles of cable to pull. And then, the winter storms hit. 15 atmospheric rivers to be exact, which brought civil work to a near standstill through April. So, how did we deliver on 2023 undergrounding plan? As scoped, on time, and at better than targeted unit cost performance? Well, during a visit with our board of directors in December, I watched proudly as the undergrounding team described how they use the PG&E performance playbook every day and at every level. What they shared wasn't one silver bullet, not just a breakthrough idea or a value stream map or a waste elimination. Rather, it was this team's commitment to living the culture, using the tools, and building the capabilities that enabled our results and which will cause future success. In 2023 alone, the undergrounding team eliminated $68 million in waste for the benefit of our customers. They did this by updating our standards, deploying optimal construction methods, and better managing spoils. With additional improvements, average unit cost came in below our target of $3.3 million to just under $3 million per mile. And the average construction cycle time improved from five and a half months back in February 2023 to three and a half months today. This was a total game changer in meeting and exceeding our 350 mile goals. Thanks to our 2023 undergrounding efforts, we can avoid proactively turning off power to about 15,000 households during dangerous high wind events. These customers who live in our highest risk areas can now sleep at night knowing they do not have to trade safety for reliability or worry that a tree might land on the power line in their backyard. This is climate resilient infrastructure for all weather conditions and for generations to come. The team reminded us that before lean we would have managed the underground efforts through spreadsheets and phone calls. That was the old PG&E way. Undergrounding team is showing us the new PG&E. Imagine the impact our performance playbook can have enterprise-wide. It's great that we achieved our 2023 goals. What's even better is that we've created a playbook enabling consistent premium performance year-end and year-out. As I like to say, performance is power. This means delivering safe, affordable and reliable service to our hometowns along with consistent predictable financial results. With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn.\nCarolyn Burke: Thank you Patti and good morning everyone. Today I'm excited to cover three topics with you. First, a recap of our 2023 results. Second, our differentiated growth opportunities. And third, how are we making this growth affordable for our customers by executing on our simple, affordable model? Starting here on slide 10, I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded all of our 2023 goals, both operational and financial. And we're on track for each of our longer-term commitments. Our 2023 report card is another proof point that our performance playbook is working. The culture and capabilities we are building here at PG&E are enabling our delivery of consistent, predictable results. It's a virtue to recycle, setting industry-leading targets, using our lean operating system to manage the day-to-day work, and then delivering on our promises, building trust with our customers and our investors. This is how we've made our system safer, faster. It's how we deliver it on our 2022 and 2023 EPS guidance. And it's how we can further strengthen our balance sheet while keeping bills affordable for our customers. I'm especially proud that we reduce non-fuel operating and maintenance costs by 5.5% in 2023. That's in addition to fully observing inflation and on top of the 3% we achieved in 2022. Looking forward, we see no shortage of opportunities to continue delivering better outcomes for customers at a lower cost all across the business. I'd note that not all of the 2023 reduction hit the bottom line, with the majority directly benefiting customers, including our self-insurance solution and substantial efficiencies in our vegetation management work. Our mid-teens by 2024 FFO to debt target is on track, and there is no change to our plan to reduce parent company debt by at least $2 billion by the end of 2026. We remain firmly committed to achieving solid investment grade ratings. In December, we were pleased to see S&P revised their rating outlook from stable to positive, indicating the potential for an upgrade in the next 12 months. And earlier this week, I'm delighted to say that Moody's upgraded our rating by one notch, also leaving us some positive outlook. This puts us one notch away from investment grade, one step closer to our goal. We value the support we receive from our regulators, helping us strengthen our balance sheet while we execute our plan to affordably serve customers and investors. For example, on February 1st, the Commission issued a proposed decision authorizing interim rate relief in the amount of $516 million, while our wildfire and gas safety cost application is pending. The interim relief may be voted on as early as March 7th, and would provide for collections to start as soon as practical over a 12-month period. Moving to slide 11, as you can see here, and as expected, the largest discrete driver of fourth quarter and full-year results was the approval of our 2023 general rate case, which added $0.15. We also saw a benefit of $0.03, partly attributed to our non-fuel O&M savings, including better resource management and improved planning and execution. Please recall that our O&M savings are part of our simple, affordable model, which allows us to complete more work for the benefit of our customers while delivering affordability. That's exactly what you see here with $0.05 of redeployment. Our savings allowed us to stand up 10 additional model yards, designed to improve frontline productivity with more efficient processes, minimizing rework, and eliminating waste as we deliver for our customers. We also provided additional training resources for our co-workers, and we accelerated inspections, calling forward work to protect 2024, and ensuring we're doing the highest priority work for our customers. We use every extra resource to better serve our customers and achieve our commitments to you, our investors. We weather the ups and downs to deliver consistent predictable results. As Patti highlighted, we ended 2023 at the top of our EPS guidance range, although our core philosophy remains to redeploy excess earnings back into the system, benefiting customers while de-risking and extending premium growth on behalf of investors. On slide 12, we are extending our CapEx and rate-based growth projections another year to include 2028, showing a five-year annual rate-based growth of 9.5%. Our new five-year capital plan represents an increase of over $10 billion, or approximately 20% over the 2023 to 2027 plan. This also is over 45% higher than the previous five-year period from 2019 to 2023. The amounts shown on this slide reflect our base capital plan, including how much our rate-based is already approved by regulators. The vast majority, or 93%, of our rate-based for this year is already authorized, as is 90% of our 2026 forecast. In addition to our plan, there are substantial needs to do more. Specifically, we have at least an incremental $5 billion of CapEx opportunities, which we will seek to fold into our plan while still meeting our affordability commitments. These include capacity investments and transmission upgrades to support continued system-wide growth. As we work to drive affordability under our simple affordable model and ongoing deployment of lean, we will look for opportunities to add this important work. As you know, this capital investment fuels both earnings growth and improves our operating cash flow, as illustrated on slide 13, which we have updated and extended since we first showed it at last year's investor day. As shown, we're projecting substantial improvement in our operating cash flow in 2024, partly as a result of the final GRC decision. Operating cash flow grows from $5 billion in 2023 to $11 billion by 2028, providing resources to grow our capital investment for customers from $9.8 billion in 2023 to $14 billion in 2028, and substantially improving our cash flow before dividends. As Patti mentioned, our guidance includes no new equity in 2024. As we look forward, we have many good efficient financing choices, including close to $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings today and rising from there at our present low level of dividend payout. Half of our funding provided from normal utility debt, substantial levels of prior cost recovery, favorable tax conditions, poor working capital improvements, the sale of a minority interest in our non-nuclear generation assets, and potentially reintroducing an at-the-market or ATM equity program in 2025. While we are not giving the final mix of our 2025 financing plan today, rest assured that our plan only includes choices which are accretive to our guidance. In light of this, we are extending our core EPS growth rate of at least 9% through 2027 and 2028. Moving to slide 14, this is our simple affordable model and a breakdown of the 5.5% O&M savings last year. Patti shared details about our undergrounding achievements in 2023, and there are many more similar stories throughout the business. I\u2019ll share just one more with you today. At our investor day, you heard about improvements we were making to the new customer connections process by leveraging our performance playbook. Now, here's how we ended the year. The team was able to save $24 million while decreasing average end-to-end lead time by 13%. That's a 50-day reduction. We also reduced engineering design time by 33%, a 37-day reduction. As a result, customer on-time delivery improved by 25 percentage points. I share this example to make an important point. This is not a cost-cutting program at PG&E. Rather, this is about good business decisions, which are sustainable for the long-term, and it's about using the performance playbook, including the Lean operating system, to improve how we do our work every day. Our actions are improving the customer experience and making capital and safety investments affordable. I'll end here on slide 15 with regulatory catalysts on the horizon in 2024. As you can see, they are still plentiful and include resolution of our proposed PacGen sale, a proposed decision in Phase 2 of our GRC, implementing Senate Bill 410 and unlocking our potential to meet the new customer demand here in California, filing of our 10-year undergrounding plan, and bringing our $5 billion of incremental capital opportunities into the plan while still meeting our affordability goals. Finally, I'll comment on our cost of capital adjustment advice letter, which was approved by Commission staff in December, raising our allowed ROE from 10% to 10.7% and truing up our cost of debt. While this adjustment is already approved and in customer rates starting this month, in January, a joint intervener group filed a late request for review of staff's approval. While we recognize this creates some uncertainty for investors, we were pleased that the Commission staff upheld operation of the adjustment mechanism in December as intended. Intervenors offered no new fundamental arguments in their request for review, and we look forward to this issue being resolved expeditiously. In the meantime, as we have said consistently, our EPS growth guidance is not dependent on the outcome, and we value the opportunity to redeploy the revenue uplift for the benefit of customers while delivering consistent, predictable results for investors. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024 and beyond. Including our 10% core EPS growth guidance and our at least 9% growth rate now extended through 2028. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, let me introduce our new report card here on slide 16, against which you'll be able to track our record of differentiated performance. We're showing our results for 2022 and 2023, along with our goals for 2024 and beyond. We believe, we have a differentiated plan and the right team in place to deliver on these objectives. As I said earlier, performance is power, and we have significant operational momentum with a healthy set of catalysts in front of us. The PG&E turnaround is on track. We trust you feel the momentum as we do. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences, as well as our investor meeting scheduled for June 12th in New York. With that, Operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey guys, good morning.\nPatricia Poppe: Morning.\nShar Pourreza: Just Patti, on the PacGen process, I mean, have you received sort of any feedback after the last round of communications with the commission? Any sort of thoughts on hurdles and deliberation. And as you guys are sort of planning around the scenarios, does the delay potentially move your equity, especially as you return OpCo cap structure to authorized levels? Thanks.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, thanks for the question, Shar. I'd say our communications with the Commission have been very constructive regarding PacGen. We know that PacGen is a good transaction for customers. California has very long-term clean energy ambitions, and this is a beautiful fleet of clean energy resources that need investment over the coming years. And to be able to share that with an investment partner is good for California's clean energy ambitions and good for customers. And so our extended time with the Commission on these topics have been good. That helps us truly make the case. And frankly, the Commission's had a lot on its plate, and so I can understand why they wanted a little more time. They know this is an important transaction. They want to give it a full look, and our conversations have been very constructive with them regarding that. I'll hand it over to Carolyn and let her discuss about our financing plans, both with and without PacGen, because we know PacGen isn't the only thing. Carolyn referenced an important set of choices that we have. PacGen is one of our choices for financing, but I'll let Carolyn go ahead and take that.\nCarolyn Burke: Thanks, Shar, for the question. Yes, and if you don't mind, I covered a lot of this in the call, but I do recognize it's been a busy morning for many of you. So let me just cover a couple of points. First, we raised and extended our core EPS guidance today. It's 12% in 2023 and at least 10% in 2024, and at least 9% now through 2028. Our refreshed five-year plan includes improvement in our operating cash flows, rising from about $5 billion in 2023 to $11 billion in 2026. And that's providing the resources to grow our capital investment and further improve our cash flow. Three, key point here, our guidance includes no new equity in 2024 with or without PacGen. And then as we look forward beyond 2024, as we said on the call, we have many good financing choices. And they include, close to $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings today, which is rising at our present load level of dividend. We have half of our funding provided from normal utility debt. We talked about substantial levers of prior cost recovery, favorable tax conditions. We are constantly working our working capital improvements. And of course, we have potentially reintroducing an at-the-market or ATM equity program in 2025. We're not giving you all the final mix of that 2025 financing plan today, but one thing that you can count on is that our plan will include choices which are accretive to our guidance.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. Perfect. Okay.\nCarolyn Burke: Well, if I just one thing on it, because I do know, and I just know I'm going to get lots of questions on the ATM. And so I just want to close that. I think it's, I just want to say very clearly to everyone that it's just simply too soon to size the potential ATM. As we've said on this call, we have a number of other good financing choices available to us. And we have other things that we need to consider, which include our growing lien capability and O&M savings. The pace at which we introduce the additional $5 billion of CapEx. And then our own advocacy and timely regulatory outcomes. And of course, the pace of our dividend growth. So just there's a lot there. And I just thought maybe because it's been a busy morning, I want to just restate all of that for you all.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. And Char, just to close out the subject, you asked a very fulsome question, so we gave you a fulsome answer. Just to close it out, we ride the roller coaster. This is what we do. There are ins and outs, ups and downs. We ride that so that we can deliver this consistent earnings growth profile that we've described and we've committed to. We intend and we plan and are very confident that we can stand by our EPS growth guidance through 2028, even with the range of equity assumptions.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And Carolyn, this is super helpful. And thank you. And just to make sure we confirm this, it sounds like you're, I don't want to say shifting, but some of your prior messaging, with the stock price kind of dictating your equity timing to now being a little bit more focused around a more systematic approach to raising equity through the trajectory like the rest of this industry is transitioning towards. Is that a fair statement?\nCarolyn Burke: Well, I think what's important is that we stand by our commitment to you that we will find the most efficient financing available to us. And at this point in time, as we look at our stock, it is not the most efficient financing.\nShar Pourreza: Fantastic. Thank you guys so much. Appreciate it.\nCarolyn Burke: Great. Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes, great, thank you.\nPatricia Poppe: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Good morning. You picked the wrong data report with NVIDIA blowing out. But -- so...\nPatricia Poppe: It's a long game, Steve. It's a long game. We know it's going to be all right.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes, yes. No, you bet, you bet. So the \u2013 just in the past, when you've talked about the growth rate, you also kind of talked to total return as part of that. And I know now that you've actually reinstated the dividend. Just any kind of reason that you didn't back to that and just -- and how are you thinking about the dividend aspect as we stand today.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Thanks, Steve, for that question. And we know that this -- obviously, our dividend is low today and the growth rate of our dividend is an area of interest for a lot of people. So I'm glad you asked. Our intent truly is to have a competitive payout ratio. And we intend to show meaningful progress during this 5-year period. And so I'm happy to be able to share more about this 5-year planning horizon. So as we think about it, this catch-up growth rate will be significant, dramatically different from peers, given our starting point. So how quickly we move within these 5 years is obviously driven by our differentiating and differentiated financing choices that Carolyn just described. And so, in this near term, I do think it's important for people to remember that we are prioritizing a healthy balance sheet, affordable investment for customers, our premium EPS growth, and then we will feather in that it would end over time. But it will obviously, as I said, have a dramatically different growth rate from peers given our starting point.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. No, that makes sense. And I guess it's better to be starting from disposition and choices have been the opposite. And then just on the yes, just on the commission and just on the packaging again. There's nothing to -- I mean they don't -- we had delays in a lot of things over time. Is it just kind of the normal process there on that? Or is something else going on with respect to the PacGen approvals?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. No, I think a couple of things just in terms of context. I do believe the adjudication of our rate case provides a lot of good visibility and discussion about cash flow, it's importance. So I do think we definitely have better alignment with the commission on subject for us, which is why we would be pursuing a PacGen transaction. I think they value the resources. And they want to make sure, on behalf of the customers of California that it's a good transaction for customers, we believe that it is a great transaction for customers it sets us up to have a partnership overtime to invest in these clean energy resources. We see growing load growth in California. We see need for new generation. This allows us to have a partner in that journey. And we know that, that will be the lowest cost of financing then for customers. And so we stand by the transaction. We know that additional time with the commission only allows us to better communicate and align with them on that.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then one more question, just on the cash flow slide, which -- that was a very helpful slide. The -- and thinking about the, I guess, the deficits that's there, each year. I mean, it's relatively modest. I mean, can a lot of that just be met with the utility debt? Because I assume utility that is not included in that yet.\nPatricia Poppe: No. I think that's the way you're thinking. I think that's right the way you're thinking about it. I'll just remind you that there is an additional $5 billion of incremental CapEx that we're looking at financing as well. And we would, again, consider that ensure that we are financing that so that it's accretive to earnings.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey thanks so much for taking my question. So I apologize, it's been a little all over the place, hopefully not repeating another question, but just the positive outlook, BAA1 and then obviously, good to see the [indiscernible] debt moved back to green here on the report card. Just what's your milestone? What's your understanding of the milestones and just kind of the time line to get to investment grade now?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Thanks for the question, Nick. We've been having good conversations with both Moody's and S&P. We remain intently focused on improving the credit quality, and we're laser-focused on achieving investment grade. We continue to make good progress on improving our credit metrics every year, and we're continuing to target mid-teens FFO to debt to 2024. Our 5-year plan shows the significant progress in 2024 and 2025 with sustained high levels of cash generation, as you mentioned, and the rating agency is obviously are looking beyond just the credit metric and beyond just our cash flow. They're also looking at improvements in our risk mitigation as it relates to wildfires, one more season perhaps for S&P. Moody's is laser focused as well on the wildfire mitigation, governance and management and improvement in our credit metrics. I think that's the most important gauge for you to look at when you consider milestones is the rating agencies and their reports themselves. We were very happy to see the recent upgrade and that we're -- we continue to be on positive outlook with both Moody's and S&P. So we're going to continue to execute on our plan, continue to execute on our risk mitigation, continue to execute on our O&M savings and continue to execute on ensuring that we see those improvements in our credit metrics for our rating agencies.\nNicholas Campanella: All right. And then I guess just the June 12 Investor Day in New York, just given you've extended the plan out to 2028, which is great to see, by the way, but just -- how do we kind of think about what that Investor Day would bring? Is this kind of more of a financing update, just given the moving pieces in the strategic financing right now? Is that fair? Or how would you characterize it?\nPatricia Poppe: I'd say one of the things that we want to make sure people know is the California context and the California backdrop for the clean energy transition. This, I would say, is going to be a very differentiated part of our story relative to peers. We see the transition here in full swing, and we are a key player in that transition. So we look forward to sharing more about our load growth forecast, what that means, what does electrification really hold for both PG&E, our shareholders, our investors as well as our customers and our hometowns. So we look forward to really giving a better long-term business outlook and of course, further refinement of our financial plan.\nNicholas Campanella: Great. Looking forward to it. Thanks a lot.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey team, can you guys hear me okay?\nPatricia Poppe: We can hear you, Julien. Good morning.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. So look, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things that were said thus far. In terms of updates around this ATM, I know you said you're expecting a lot of questions, but just to frame it out really. In terms of the time line here, I mean, A, you've got to know what happens with PacGen by middle part of the year. But B, I suspect you're going to continue to evaluate asset sales, you said that would be something incremental to what PacGen would materialize that. And then by the end of the year, if there was nothing else that would materialize, then you would kind of go back to that sort of last resort ATM. I mean, given the success in cost cuts, etcetera, I mean, you could kind of interpret that as effectively saying, Look, there's a lot of other levers we'll probably pull in the interim and a successful outcome at least at this stage with this equity price would be not necessarily pursuing an ATM. Is that kind of a fair way to frame it?\nCarolyn Burke: The way I would frame it is more that it's -- one, it's really, as I said, just too soon to size a potential ATM in 2025. But we have a lot of good options to consider. And so -- and we're looking, in particular, as you just mentioned, our growing lean capability and those O&M savings. You see -- you saw that we achieved 3% in 2022 and last year, 5.5%. So we're very excited about the success there and think that could be a factor. We talked about the additional $5 billion in new CapEx. We're going to make sure that, that's affordable to bring in to our plan and that we can finance it with one of these -- all of these options. So what's the timing that we introduced that $5 billion of new CapEx? And as you know, we do have a number of in-flight regulatory outcomes that we've been advocating for. And so the timing of those will really depend on how we're thinking about the ATM, a potential ATM in 2025. And of course, as Patti just covered, the timing of our dividend growth, we'll have more clarity on that and as we go into 2025 as well. So all of those are what really will drive a potential size of an ATM.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I appreciate you entertaining another question on this. And maybe just coming back, speaking of investment and successes, right, I appreciate your story, Patti. Can you talk a little bit to -- in light of those successes, how do you think about the cadence of undergrounding as you think about this year and further years, I mean, has that sort of unlocked an ability to actually accelerate what you were doing earlier and really remain on track in a more structural way. And what would be the regulatory considerations around that be to the extent to which that was an avenue that you now see increasingly as possible?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. I do think last year was an important proof point for everybody, ourselves included, that it can be done and we can do undergrounding at scale and in an affordable way for customers. Fundamentally changing the health and well-being of the customers who live near those lines. So that's our first point. But remember, the general rate case did reduce our mileage from what we had filed. So this year, we're actually probably going to do about 250 miles of undergrounding in line with the rate case. We will be filing our 10-year undergrounding plan as required by SB 884 and that will then give us a window into -- and hopefully, an approval by the end of 2025, early 2026 that we can see then in 2026 and beyond a 10-year plan for undergrounding as an important part of the climate resilient infrastructure of California. And again, I'll remind you, our undergrounding plan is not a big bet. It's about 8% of our total line miles but it's 8% in the highest risk areas. So it eliminates this choice between reliability and safety for customers. They can have both and they can have that affordably. So we'll be able to make that case very well in our filing and our 10-year filing and show the total long-term net present value benefit to customers of doing that kind of infrastructure in those places. But our capital plan is very fulsome with a variety of capital investments, and it doesn't hinge on the ungrounding plan, though we stand by that important infrastructure again as climate reliant infrastructure for the people in California of the future, not the climate of the past, but the climate that's becoming more and more real, we need to have infrastructure that is up to the challenge.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Fair enough guys. I\u2019ll see you soon.\nPatricia Poppe: Great. Thanks Julien.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.\nGregg Orrill: Yes. Thank you, good morning. Just coming back to the cash flow slide. I was wondering if you could help fill in some of the drivers between 2024 and 2025. 2025, the dot looks to be around $10 billion in cash flow versus the $8 billion in 2024 in but you've got the wildfire recoveries coming down. So obviously, depreciation is a driver growth just struggling to connect the dots a little bit.\nPatricia Poppe: So the $5 billion to the $8 billion from 2023 to 2024 million is your question. What's driving that? Just making sure I'm...\nGregg Orrill: Well really to 2025 because you got the wildfire recoveries coming down, but you've got the cash flow going up.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Well, primarily, that is our GRC from 2024 to 2024, the additional revenues from there. In addition to that, just remember, we have our 2% savings being compounded. And so we see that. The other key part of 2024 versus 2025 as we see a decrease in litigation as it relates to our wildfire has been part of our puzzle. And then as we -- our outlook on commodity prices, we have lower collateral postings as well. So there's a lot of moving parts, but the primary driver of the increase really is our rate base recovery from our GRC. That is the main part of the story, but there's a lot of other moving parts.\nGregg Orrill: Okay, got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. What would be the rate payer impact of a year delay to potential PacGen sale as you see it?\nPatricia Poppe: Just the savings from PacGen sale, is that in terms of the benefits from that -- I'm sorry I'm just making sure.\nRyan Levine: Yes. I mean you've articulated publicly or mine that there is rate benefits this transaction. So I'm just trying to get a sense of why you see a delay or a year?\nCarolyn Burke: Yes. We think this is a great transaction for customers, right? It provides customer affordability primarily through financing costs at PacGen as well as because it's improving our balance sheet, we expect to be able to up and we expect to lower financing costs for our customers G&A as well. But as Patti mentioned, we also see significant benefits for customers because these assets are so key to the clean energy goal. And having a partner that is bringing both the resources and the interest and expertise in supporting these future capital growth needs of this very important portfolio, we think that's where it's particularly going to benefit customers. So there are the two things I would point to.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And what is the enterprise lean majority percentages in your scorecard measuring, it seems very specific around 44% for the recent year?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. We do an assessment of all of our leaders and what their maturity is of the adoption and implementation of our 5 basic place, and it's a self-assessment. So the team reviews what's the standard and how are they performing to the standard of these 5 plays. And the point of the 44% score is that, that means that we have lots of room to grow our maturity. And so if you can imagine, delivering 5.5% non-fuel O&M savings, at a maturity level in the 40s, just think of the potential benefit for customers and our processes and our O&M savings over time when we grow that maturity enterprise-wide.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then what are the practical implications of bills going out for gas in February and in March for electric, if the cost of capital trigger doesn't hold?\nPatricia Poppe: So if the cost of capital trigger does not hold with the implications. It's very minor in terms of the monthly bill rate for the cost of capital adjustment. It was a couple of bucks.\nRyan Levine: Would that get reimbursed or in future years? Or mechanically, how does that work?\nPatricia Poppe: I think it would depend on the determination and how that determination is implemented.\nRyan Levine: Thanks for taking my questions.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey good morning team. Just I wanted to have a quick follow-up to one of Nick's questions, I guess, on the credit rating. Curious, Carolyn, on S&P, I think you had stated there waiting for one more season. Do you know what they want to see in the one season prior to an upgrade?\nCarolyn Burke: I think it's another season of performance by our team. I think there are some folks, and we've heard this from even in analyst calls that the last two winters have been not significantly in terms of a wildfire season. But we've proven with our numbers when you even adjust for the weather that we are continuing to reduce wildfire risk. And I know Patti has a...\nPatricia Poppe: And I would just say in our conversations with S&P, they focus on three main things. I would say, first, it's management and governance post-bankruptcy. So I do believe that's what they're looking at first, and then they want to see additional wildfire performance, which we feel very confident about. And then finally, obviously, the financial metrics. And so, we do -- we're -- we've been on positive outlook with them. They put us on positive outlook at the end of the year. So we look forward to them moving on that sometime in 2024.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then just one follow-up on the cost of capital challenge. Is there a date where -- I don't know if the right term is the challenge gets dismissed or I know it's already in rates. I know it's not going to impact the company's 2024 guidance. But just is there a date where the commission denies the challenge?\nPatricia Poppe: There is nothing firm or definitive about that. You're right. Your thoughts are correct, though, that it is in rates and it doesn't have a bearing on our 2024 earnings other than to say that we have planned conservatively for either outcome.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey good morning. Thanks so much. Great to see you're extending the EPS growth rate here. I was just wondering kind of what gave you the confidence now to provide those EPS growth assumptions through 28 [ph] given that there's another cost of capital proceeding another GRC in the midst of that planning period?\nPatricia Poppe: We have a great plan, and it's anchored in our simple, affordable model. We have ample capital demand. And this is the thing that I want to just acknowledge for our customers who are feeling the catch-up in our bills right now. We know that we can deliver this capital infrastructure, which they have been demanding and requesting and asking for us to deliver in an affordable way. So as we look forward, we have a conservative plan. We ride that roller coaster so we can deliver a consistent outcome for investors and better service every single year for customers. And frankly, we look forward to a time in the not-too-distant horizon where we're going to be lowering bills for customers as we do that. The simple affordable model will work here in California. We are in the early days. But as we look forward, we see the capital demand matched by our cost savings, load growth and efficient financing, which allows for affordable bills for customers. That's a formula that can work for a long time forward. It gives us a lot of confidence as we give forecasted EPS growth guidance in the next 5-year plan.\nCarolyn Burke: And David, I'll just remind you, we always plan conservatively. And so that's what gives us also lots of confidence.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Excellent, thanks. And then maybe on load growth, it's the data center backdrop seems to have changed quite a bit maybe since you've given that 1% to 3% load growth figure. And it sounds like you might address that in upcoming Analyst Day. I was just wondering if that's reflective of what you've seen in your service territory in terms of that data center demand, is that accelerating ramping up from what your prior expectations had been?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Well, I can share that just in 2023, we had a 3x increase in data center applications versus the prior four years. So as we look at the 5-year forward load growth forecast, the back end of that forecast will reflect then the additional data center demand. And look, I think we all can agree that the only thing that's happening with data centers is they need more of them. And so part of the deal here is we need to make ourselves available and accessible and show that we can in fact serve that load here in California, which is what we're doing. And we'll look forward to sharing more about that in June.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, great. Much appreciated\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, David.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Patti Poppe for closing remarks.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Mandeep [ph]. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I know it was a busy one, and we appreciate your time and attention. We look forward to staying in touch with you. I just want to give a final remark and thank the entire PG&E team for delivering an outstanding 2023 for customers. They deliver for our hometowns. We're serving our planet, and we're leading with love at PG&E, and I couldn't be more proud to stand alongside with the men and women of PG&E to do just that. So feel really great about our turnaround. We know that, that turnaround is on track. Thanks to all those great people here at the company, and we look forward to seeing all of you in the coming months and definitely in June, on June 12 in New York. Thanks so much. Have a safe day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carolyn Burke",
            "content": "Thank you Patti and good morning everyone. Today I'm excited to cover three topics with you. First, a recap of our 2023 results. Second, our differentiated growth opportunities. And third, how are we making this growth affordable for our customers by executing on our simple, affordable model? Starting here on slide 10, I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded all of our 2023 goals, both operational and financial. And we're on track for each of our longer-term commitments. Our 2023 report card is another proof point that our performance playbook is working. The culture and capabilities we are building here at PG&E are enabling our delivery of consistent, predictable results. It's a virtue to recycle, setting industry-leading targets, using our lean operating system to manage the day-to-day work, and then delivering on our promises, building trust with our customers and our investors. This is how we've made our system safer, faster. It's how we deliver it on our 2022 and 2023 EPS guidance. And it's how we can further strengthen our balance sheet while keeping bills affordable for our customers. I'm especially proud that we reduce non-fuel operating and maintenance costs by 5.5% in 2023. That's in addition to fully observing inflation and on top of the 3% we achieved in 2022. Looking forward, we see no shortage of opportunities to continue delivering better outcomes for customers at a lower cost all across the business. I'd note that not all of the 2023 reduction hit the bottom line, with the majority directly benefiting customers, including our self-insurance solution and substantial efficiencies in our vegetation management work. Our mid-teens by 2024 FFO to debt target is on track, and there is no change to our plan to reduce parent company debt by at least $2 billion by the end of 2026. We remain firmly committed to achieving solid investment grade ratings. In December, we were pleased to see S&P revised their rating outlook from stable to positive, indicating the potential for an upgrade in the next 12 months. And earlier this week, I'm delighted to say that Moody's upgraded our rating by one notch, also leaving us some positive outlook. This puts us one notch away from investment grade, one step closer to our goal. We value the support we receive from our regulators, helping us strengthen our balance sheet while we execute our plan to affordably serve customers and investors. For example, on February 1st, the Commission issued a proposed decision authorizing interim rate relief in the amount of $516 million, while our wildfire and gas safety cost application is pending. The interim relief may be voted on as early as March 7th, and would provide for collections to start as soon as practical over a 12-month period. Moving to slide 11, as you can see here, and as expected, the largest discrete driver of fourth quarter and full-year results was the approval of our 2023 general rate case, which added $0.15. We also saw a benefit of $0.03, partly attributed to our non-fuel O&M savings, including better resource management and improved planning and execution. Please recall that our O&M savings are part of our simple, affordable model, which allows us to complete more work for the benefit of our customers while delivering affordability. That's exactly what you see here with $0.05 of redeployment. Our savings allowed us to stand up 10 additional model yards, designed to improve frontline productivity with more efficient processes, minimizing rework, and eliminating waste as we deliver for our customers. We also provided additional training resources for our co-workers, and we accelerated inspections, calling forward work to protect 2024, and ensuring we're doing the highest priority work for our customers. We use every extra resource to better serve our customers and achieve our commitments to you, our investors. We weather the ups and downs to deliver consistent predictable results. As Patti highlighted, we ended 2023 at the top of our EPS guidance range, although our core philosophy remains to redeploy excess earnings back into the system, benefiting customers while de-risking and extending premium growth on behalf of investors. On slide 12, we are extending our CapEx and rate-based growth projections another year to include 2028, showing a five-year annual rate-based growth of 9.5%. Our new five-year capital plan represents an increase of over $10 billion, or approximately 20% over the 2023 to 2027 plan. This also is over 45% higher than the previous five-year period from 2019 to 2023. The amounts shown on this slide reflect our base capital plan, including how much our rate-based is already approved by regulators. The vast majority, or 93%, of our rate-based for this year is already authorized, as is 90% of our 2026 forecast. In addition to our plan, there are substantial needs to do more. Specifically, we have at least an incremental $5 billion of CapEx opportunities, which we will seek to fold into our plan while still meeting our affordability commitments. These include capacity investments and transmission upgrades to support continued system-wide growth. As we work to drive affordability under our simple affordable model and ongoing deployment of lean, we will look for opportunities to add this important work. As you know, this capital investment fuels both earnings growth and improves our operating cash flow, as illustrated on slide 13, which we have updated and extended since we first showed it at last year's investor day. As shown, we're projecting substantial improvement in our operating cash flow in 2024, partly as a result of the final GRC decision. Operating cash flow grows from $5 billion in 2023 to $11 billion by 2028, providing resources to grow our capital investment for customers from $9.8 billion in 2023 to $14 billion in 2028, and substantially improving our cash flow before dividends. As Patti mentioned, our guidance includes no new equity in 2024. As we look forward, we have many good efficient financing choices, including close to $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings today and rising from there at our present low level of dividend payout. Half of our funding provided from normal utility debt, substantial levels of prior cost recovery, favorable tax conditions, poor working capital improvements, the sale of a minority interest in our non-nuclear generation assets, and potentially reintroducing an at-the-market or ATM equity program in 2025. While we are not giving the final mix of our 2025 financing plan today, rest assured that our plan only includes choices which are accretive to our guidance. In light of this, we are extending our core EPS growth rate of at least 9% through 2027 and 2028. Moving to slide 14, this is our simple affordable model and a breakdown of the 5.5% O&M savings last year. Patti shared details about our undergrounding achievements in 2023, and there are many more similar stories throughout the business. I'll share just one more with you today. At our investor day, you heard about improvements we were making to the new customer connections process by leveraging our performance playbook. Now, here's how we ended the year. The team was able to save $24 million while decreasing average end-to-end lead time by 13%. That's a 50-day reduction. We also reduced engineering design time by 33%, a 37-day reduction. As a result, customer on-time delivery improved by 25 percentage points. I share this example to make an important point. This is not a cost-cutting program at PG&E. Rather, this is about good business decisions, which are sustainable for the long-term, and it's about using the performance playbook, including the Lean operating system, to improve how we do our work every day. Our actions are improving the customer experience and making capital and safety investments affordable. I'll end here on slide 15 with regulatory catalysts on the horizon in 2024. As you can see, they are still plentiful and include resolution of our proposed PacGen sale, a proposed decision in Phase 2 of our GRC, implementing Senate Bill 410 and unlocking our potential to meet the new customer demand here in California, filing of our 10-year undergrounding plan, and bringing our $5 billion of incremental capital opportunities into the plan while still meeting our affordability goals. Finally, I'll comment on our cost of capital adjustment advice letter, which was approved by Commission staff in December, raising our allowed ROE from 10% to 10.7% and truing up our cost of debt. While this adjustment is already approved and in customer rates starting this month, in January, a joint intervener group filed a late request for review of staff's approval. While we recognize this creates some uncertainty for investors, we were pleased that the Commission staff upheld operation of the adjustment mechanism in December as intended. Intervenors offered no new fundamental arguments in their request for review, and we look forward to this issue being resolved expeditiously. In the meantime, as we have said consistently, our EPS growth guidance is not dependent on the outcome, and we value the opportunity to redeploy the revenue uplift for the benefit of customers while delivering consistent, predictable results for investors. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024 and beyond. Including our 10% core EPS growth guidance and our at least 9% growth rate now extended through 2028. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti. Thanks, Shar, for the question. Yes, and if you don't mind, I covered a lot of this in the call, but I do recognize it's been a busy morning for many of you. So let me just cover a couple of points. First, we raised and extended our core EPS guidance today. It's 12% in 2023 and at least 10% in 2024, and at least 9% now through 2028. Our refreshed five-year plan includes improvement in our operating cash flows, rising from about $5 billion in 2023 to $11 billion in 2026. And that's providing the resources to grow our capital investment and further improve our cash flow. Three, key point here, our guidance includes no new equity in 2024 with or without PacGen. And then as we look forward beyond 2024, as we said on the call, we have many good financing choices. And they include, close to $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings today, which is rising at our present load level of dividend. We have half of our funding provided from normal utility debt. We talked about substantial levers of prior cost recovery, favorable tax conditions. We are constantly working our working capital improvements. And of course, we have potentially reintroducing an at-the-market or ATM equity program in 2025. We're not giving you all the final mix of that 2025 financing plan today, but one thing that you can count on is that our plan will include choices which are accretive to our guidance. Well, if I just one thing on it, because I do know, and I just know I'm going to get lots of questions on the ATM. And so I just want to close that. I think it's, I just want to say very clearly to everyone that it's just simply too soon to size the potential ATM. As we've said on this call, we have a number of other good financing choices available to us. And we have other things that we need to consider, which include our growing lien capability and O&M savings. The pace at which we introduce the additional $5 billion of CapEx. And then our own advocacy and timely regulatory outcomes. And of course, the pace of our dividend growth. So just there's a lot there. And I just thought maybe because it's been a busy morning, I want to just restate all of that for you all. Well, I think what's important is that we stand by our commitment to you that we will find the most efficient financing available to us. And at this point in time, as we look at our stock, it is not the most efficient financing. Great. Thanks, Shar. The way I would frame it is more that it's -- one, it's really, as I said, just too soon to size a potential ATM in 2025. But we have a lot of good options to consider. And so -- and we're looking, in particular, as you just mentioned, our growing lean capability and those O&M savings. You see -- you saw that we achieved 3% in 2022 and last year, 5.5%. So we're very excited about the success there and think that could be a factor. We talked about the additional $5 billion in new CapEx. We're going to make sure that, that's affordable to bring in to our plan and that we can finance it with one of these -- all of these options. So what's the timing that we introduced that $5 billion of new CapEx? And as you know, we do have a number of in-flight regulatory outcomes that we've been advocating for. And so the timing of those will really depend on how we're thinking about the ATM, a potential ATM in 2025. And of course, as Patti just covered, the timing of our dividend growth, we'll have more clarity on that and as we go into 2025 as well. So all of those are what really will drive a potential size of an ATM. Yes. We think this is a great transaction for customers, right? It provides customer affordability primarily through financing costs at PacGen as well as because it's improving our balance sheet, we expect to be able to up and we expect to lower financing costs for our customers G&A as well. But as Patti mentioned, we also see significant benefits for customers because these assets are so key to the clean energy goal. And having a partner that is bringing both the resources and the interest and expertise in supporting these future capital growth needs of this very important portfolio, we think that's where it's particularly going to benefit customers. So there are the two things I would point to. I think it's another season of performance by our team. I think there are some folks, and we've heard this from even in analyst calls that the last two winters have been not significantly in terms of a wildfire season. But we've proven with our numbers when you even adjust for the weather that we are continuing to reduce wildfire risk. And I know Patti has a... And David, I'll just remind you, we always plan conservatively. And so that's what gives us also lots of confidence."

            "name": "Patricia Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. This morning we reported full year core earnings of $1.23 delivering at the high end of our annual guidance range. This result represents growth of 12% over our 2022 results of $1.10. In the fourth quarter we recognized the full year benefit of our 2023 general rate case as expected. I'm also pleased to announce that we exceeded our 2% annual nonfuel O&M savings target for the second consecutive year with savings coming in at 5.5% and pushing our EPS to the high end of the range. Because these savings were predominantly generated by reducing waste and improving service, they benefit customers today and benefit investors for years to come. Looking to 2024, we are reaffirming our at least 10% growth target which is now based on our actual 2023 results of $1.23. This results in an increase to our 2024 core earnings guidance range with a new higher midpoint of $1.35 versus our previous guidance of $1.33. We also reaffirm our commitment to at least 9% core EPS growth for both 2025 and 2026, re-based off our actual 2023 results in our new 2024 range. In addition, I'm pleased to share that we're extending our core EPS growth guidance of at least 9% for an additional two years through 2028. Our needed customer investment leads to strong rate-based growth, which continues to be the primary driver of our future earnings growth. We're providing you with updated five-year forecasts for both rate-based and CapEx in today's slides. These numbers now extend to 2028 and show a consistent compound annual growth rate of 9.5% using the new base year of 2023. Finally, we reaffirm our commitment to no new equity in 2024 and remain committed to pursuing the most efficient forms of financing available for 2025 and beyond, which Carolyn will discuss in her remarks. On slide four, we've added 2023 actuals illustrating our high end of guidance results and the rebasing of forward year growth rates now through 2028. This is our simple, affordable model in action. The list in 2023 reflects our 5.5% non-fuel O&M reduction well above our 2% plan. Slide five is a reminder of the key elements of our simple, affordable model, which allows us to continue growing customer capital investment at 9% or more while containing customer bill increases at or below assumed inflation in the 2% to 4% range. Key enablers in the model are ongoing annual non-fuel O&M reductions of 2%, efficient financing, and electric low growth in the 1% to 3% range. The proof is in the numbers. The simple, affordable model works. You first saw slide six during our November business update call. This version has been updated for a few additional known items, such as the 2024 cost of capital trigger. Our new ROE of 10.7% took effect on January 1st this year, with collections beginning this month in gas rates and next month for electric. Delivering on this projected 2% to 4% bill growth trajectory is an essential element of the PG&E plan, and one which will be important for building trust with our customers over the long run. For our average gas and electric residential customer, average monthly bill increases are limited to the 2% to 4% range from 2023 through 2026. I wanted to be clear that this includes the step up in 2024 as we implement the GRC and other deferred cost recoveries. Our plan shows average bills stepping down, beginning later this year and further in both 2025 and 2026, keeping the average annual increase in the lower half of the 2% to 4% range as catch-up recoveries roll off. Two of the larger items are around $1 billion of 2022 WMCE interim rate relief, which comes off bills in mid-2024, and the 24-month collection of our first-year GRC revenues, which come off at the start of 2026. Let me say that again. Based on what we know today, our bills will rise at the lower half of the range, around 2.5% per year on average for the duration of this rate case from 2023 through 2026. Let's shift gears to the significant progress the team has made on risk mitigation. Slide seven updates our 2023 admission data for the full year. Total CPUC reportable admissions came in at 65% for 2023, down 68% from the 2017 baseline, and 29% down from 2022. On the right side of the slide, we're showing our weather normalized ignition rate, which is a metric from our wildfire mitigation plan. This year's number of 0.93 was a reduction of 71% from 2017, and our lowest annual number since we began calculating this metric. The metric demonstrates that we continue to drive down wildfire risk in 2023, even after adjusting for fewer circuit mile days under our three or higher conditions when the risks of catastrophic wildfire are highest. While we're extremely pleased with these results, our team certainly isn't stopping here. We see further opportunities to drive overall wildfire risk reduction beyond the 94% achieved in 2023, as we continue with additional system hardening and deployment of new technologies. In addition to the physical risk reduction, financial risks are also lower, including key protections under AB 1054, which were reaffirmed with the issuance of our annual safety certificate last month. Looking forward, here on Slide eight, we want to take a moment to highlight how we see PG&E offering investors a truly differentiated, high-quality utility growth story. This starts with premium rate-based growth and industry leading 9.5%. What sets us apart is our commitment to make this investment affordable for our customers. The key enabler is our ability to drive consistent non-fuel O&M savings as we deploy our lane operating system in a utility, which previously saw cost compound at an annual 10% rate over the prior five years. As a reminder, several years of doing whatever was necessary to respond to back-to-back crisis pushed our capital-to-expense ratio far below the industry average. This is where we have a wealth of opportunity and a long runway to drive efficiencies with sustainable savings benefiting both our customers and our investors. We expect future load growth related to California's leadership and electrification to be a further differentiator and one which will help keep customer build growth within our 2% to 4% forecast. In addition to continued adoption of electric vehicles throughout our service territory, we have seen a three-fold increase in data center applications in 2023 versus the prior four years. We plan to speak more about these load growth trends over the course of this year, including at an investor meeting which we are planning for June 12th in New York, so please mark your calendars for that. The fundamental differentiators of rate-based growth, O&M savings, and load growth, we would add our constructive state regulatory and policy environment in California. Key elements of the California regulatory model include four years of revenue certainty under the GRC, returns which are set separately from the GRC including a formulaic adjustment mechanism, and timely recovery for pass-through of important cost categories including fuel and pension. With our GRC resolved, we now have revenue certainty extended through 2026, giving us the best level of regulatory visibility we've had since I joined PG&E and something which any regulated utility would love. This brings me to our performance playbook, including our lean operating system, which is becoming a critical differentiator for PG&E as we continue building a sustainable culture based on continuous improvement and what we refer to as breakthrough thinking. And so, on slide nine, to my story of the month, or in this case, the story of the year. Let me first take you back to the beginning of 2023. We had a goal to underground 350 miles of electric lines at a unit cost of $3.3 million per mile. We started 2023 with only about five miles of civil construction fully complete. At that point, we had hundreds of miles still to design, thousands of individual easements to negotiate, 345 miles of trenches to dig, and 350 miles of cable to pull. And then, the winter storms hit. 15 atmospheric rivers to be exact, which brought civil work to a near standstill through April. So, how did we deliver on 2023 undergrounding plan? As scoped, on time, and at better than targeted unit cost performance? Well, during a visit with our board of directors in December, I watched proudly as the undergrounding team described how they use the PG&E performance playbook every day and at every level. What they shared wasn't one silver bullet, not just a breakthrough idea or a value stream map or a waste elimination. Rather, it was this team's commitment to living the culture, using the tools, and building the capabilities that enabled our results and which will cause future success. In 2023 alone, the undergrounding team eliminated $68 million in waste for the benefit of our customers. They did this by updating our standards, deploying optimal construction methods, and better managing spoils. With additional improvements, average unit cost came in below our target of $3.3 million to just under $3 million per mile. And the average construction cycle time improved from five and a half months back in February 2023 to three and a half months today. This was a total game changer in meeting and exceeding our 350 mile goals. Thanks to our 2023 undergrounding efforts, we can avoid proactively turning off power to about 15,000 households during dangerous high wind events. These customers who live in our highest risk areas can now sleep at night knowing they do not have to trade safety for reliability or worry that a tree might land on the power line in their backyard. This is climate resilient infrastructure for all weather conditions and for generations to come. The team reminded us that before lean we would have managed the underground efforts through spreadsheets and phone calls. That was the old PG&E way. Undergrounding team is showing us the new PG&E. Imagine the impact our performance playbook can have enterprise-wide. It's great that we achieved our 2023 goals. What's even better is that we've created a playbook enabling consistent premium performance year-end and year-out. As I like to say, performance is power. This means delivering safe, affordable and reliable service to our hometowns along with consistent predictable financial results. With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn. Thank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, let me introduce our new report card here on slide 16, against which you'll be able to track our record of differentiated performance. We're showing our results for 2022 and 2023, along with our goals for 2024 and beyond. We believe, we have a differentiated plan and the right team in place to deliver on these objectives. As I said earlier, performance is power, and we have significant operational momentum with a healthy set of catalysts in front of us. The PG&E turnaround is on track. We trust you feel the momentum as we do. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences, as well as our investor meeting scheduled for June 12th in New York. With that, Operator, please open the lines for questions. Morning. Yes, thanks for the question, Shar. I'd say our communications with the Commission have been very constructive regarding PacGen. We know that PacGen is a good transaction for customers. California has very long-term clean energy ambitions, and this is a beautiful fleet of clean energy resources that need investment over the coming years. And to be able to share that with an investment partner is good for California's clean energy ambitions and good for customers. And so our extended time with the Commission on these topics have been good. That helps us truly make the case. And frankly, the Commission's had a lot on its plate, and so I can understand why they wanted a little more time. They know this is an important transaction. They want to give it a full look, and our conversations have been very constructive with them regarding that. I'll hand it over to Carolyn and let her discuss about our financing plans, both with and without PacGen, because we know PacGen isn't the only thing. Carolyn referenced an important set of choices that we have. PacGen is one of our choices for financing, but I'll let Carolyn go ahead and take that. Yes. And Char, just to close out the subject, you asked a very fulsome question, so we gave you a fulsome answer. Just to close it out, we ride the roller coaster. This is what we do. There are ins and outs, ups and downs. We ride that so that we can deliver this consistent earnings growth profile that we've described and we've committed to. We intend and we plan and are very confident that we can stand by our EPS growth guidance through 2028, even with the range of equity assumptions. Hi, Steve. It's a long game, Steve. It's a long game. We know it's going to be all right. Yes. Thanks, Steve, for that question. And we know that this -- obviously, our dividend is low today and the growth rate of our dividend is an area of interest for a lot of people. So I'm glad you asked. Our intent truly is to have a competitive payout ratio. And we intend to show meaningful progress during this 5-year period. And so I'm happy to be able to share more about this 5-year planning horizon. So as we think about it, this catch-up growth rate will be significant, dramatically different from peers, given our starting point. So how quickly we move within these 5 years is obviously driven by our differentiating and differentiated financing choices that Carolyn just described. And so, in this near term, I do think it's important for people to remember that we are prioritizing a healthy balance sheet, affordable investment for customers, our premium EPS growth, and then we will feather in that it would end over time. But it will obviously, as I said, have a dramatically different growth rate from peers given our starting point. Yes. No, I think a couple of things just in terms of context. I do believe the adjudication of our rate case provides a lot of good visibility and discussion about cash flow, it's importance. So I do think we definitely have better alignment with the commission on subject for us, which is why we would be pursuing a PacGen transaction. I think they value the resources. And they want to make sure, on behalf of the customers of California that it's a good transaction for customers, we believe that it is a great transaction for customers it sets us up to have a partnership overtime to invest in these clean energy resources. We see growing load growth in California. We see need for new generation. This allows us to have a partner in that journey. And we know that, that will be the lowest cost of financing then for customers. And so we stand by the transaction. We know that additional time with the commission only allows us to better communicate and align with them on that. No. I think that's the way you're thinking. I think that's right the way you're thinking about it. I'll just remind you that there is an additional $5 billion of incremental CapEx that we're looking at financing as well. And we would, again, consider that ensure that we are financing that so that it's accretive to earnings. Yes. Thanks for the question, Nick. We've been having good conversations with both Moody's and S&P. We remain intently focused on improving the credit quality, and we're laser-focused on achieving investment grade. We continue to make good progress on improving our credit metrics every year, and we're continuing to target mid-teens FFO to debt to 2024. Our 5-year plan shows the significant progress in 2024 and 2025 with sustained high levels of cash generation, as you mentioned, and the rating agency is obviously are looking beyond just the credit metric and beyond just our cash flow. They're also looking at improvements in our risk mitigation as it relates to wildfires, one more season perhaps for S&P. Moody's is laser focused as well on the wildfire mitigation, governance and management and improvement in our credit metrics. I think that's the most important gauge for you to look at when you consider milestones is the rating agencies and their reports themselves. We were very happy to see the recent upgrade and that we're -- we continue to be on positive outlook with both Moody's and S&P. So we're going to continue to execute on our plan, continue to execute on our risk mitigation, continue to execute on our O&M savings and continue to execute on ensuring that we see those improvements in our credit metrics for our rating agencies. I'd say one of the things that we want to make sure people know is the California context and the California backdrop for the clean energy transition. This, I would say, is going to be a very differentiated part of our story relative to peers. We see the transition here in full swing, and we are a key player in that transition. So we look forward to sharing more about our load growth forecast, what that means, what does electrification really hold for both PG&E, our shareholders, our investors as well as our customers and our hometowns. So we look forward to really giving a better long-term business outlook and of course, further refinement of our financial plan. Thanks, Nick. We can hear you, Julien. Good morning. Yes. I do think last year was an important proof point for everybody, ourselves included, that it can be done and we can do undergrounding at scale and in an affordable way for customers. Fundamentally changing the health and well-being of the customers who live near those lines. So that's our first point. But remember, the general rate case did reduce our mileage from what we had filed. So this year, we're actually probably going to do about 250 miles of undergrounding in line with the rate case. We will be filing our 10-year undergrounding plan as required by SB 884 and that will then give us a window into -- and hopefully, an approval by the end of 2025, early 2026 that we can see then in 2026 and beyond a 10-year plan for undergrounding as an important part of the climate resilient infrastructure of California. And again, I'll remind you, our undergrounding plan is not a big bet. It's about 8% of our total line miles but it's 8% in the highest risk areas. So it eliminates this choice between reliability and safety for customers. They can have both and they can have that affordably. So we'll be able to make that case very well in our filing and our 10-year filing and show the total long-term net present value benefit to customers of doing that kind of infrastructure in those places. But our capital plan is very fulsome with a variety of capital investments, and it doesn't hinge on the ungrounding plan, though we stand by that important infrastructure again as climate reliant infrastructure for the people in California of the future, not the climate of the past, but the climate that's becoming more and more real, we need to have infrastructure that is up to the challenge. Great. Thanks Julien. So the $5 billion to the $8 billion from 2023 to 2024 million is your question. What's driving that? Just making sure I'm... Yes. Well, primarily, that is our GRC from 2024 to 2024, the additional revenues from there. In addition to that, just remember, we have our 2% savings being compounded. And so we see that. The other key part of 2024 versus 2025 as we see a decrease in litigation as it relates to our wildfire has been part of our puzzle. And then as we -- our outlook on commodity prices, we have lower collateral postings as well. So there's a lot of moving parts, but the primary driver of the increase really is our rate base recovery from our GRC. That is the main part of the story, but there's a lot of other moving parts. Just the savings from PacGen sale, is that in terms of the benefits from that -- I'm sorry I'm just making sure. Yes. We do an assessment of all of our leaders and what their maturity is of the adoption and implementation of our 5 basic place, and it's a self-assessment. So the team reviews what's the standard and how are they performing to the standard of these 5 plays. And the point of the 44% score is that, that means that we have lots of room to grow our maturity. And so if you can imagine, delivering 5.5% non-fuel O&M savings, at a maturity level in the 40s, just think of the potential benefit for customers and our processes and our O&M savings over time when we grow that maturity enterprise-wide. So if the cost of capital trigger does not hold with the implications. It's very minor in terms of the monthly bill rate for the cost of capital adjustment. It was a couple of bucks. I think it would depend on the determination and how that determination is implemented. Thanks, Ryan. And I would just say in our conversations with S&P, they focus on three main things. I would say, first, it's management and governance post-bankruptcy. So I do believe that's what they're looking at first, and then they want to see additional wildfire performance, which we feel very confident about. And then finally, obviously, the financial metrics. And so, we do -- we're -- we've been on positive outlook with them. They put us on positive outlook at the end of the year. So we look forward to them moving on that sometime in 2024. There is nothing firm or definitive about that. You're right. Your thoughts are correct, though, that it is in rates and it doesn't have a bearing on our 2024 earnings other than to say that we have planned conservatively for either outcome. We have a great plan, and it's anchored in our simple, affordable model. We have ample capital demand. And this is the thing that I want to just acknowledge for our customers who are feeling the catch-up in our bills right now. We know that we can deliver this capital infrastructure, which they have been demanding and requesting and asking for us to deliver in an affordable way. So as we look forward, we have a conservative plan. We ride that roller coaster so we can deliver a consistent outcome for investors and better service every single year for customers. And frankly, we look forward to a time in the not-too-distant horizon where we're going to be lowering bills for customers as we do that. The simple affordable model will work here in California. We are in the early days. But as we look forward, we see the capital demand matched by our cost savings, load growth and efficient financing, which allows for affordable bills for customers. That's a formula that can work for a long time forward. It gives us a lot of confidence as we give forecasted EPS growth guidance in the next 5-year plan. Yes. Well, I can share that just in 2023, we had a 3x increase in data center applications versus the prior four years. So as we look at the 5-year forward load growth forecast, the back end of that forecast will reflect then the additional data center demand. And look, I think we all can agree that the only thing that's happening with data centers is they need more of them. And so part of the deal here is we need to make ourselves available and accessible and show that we can in fact serve that load here in California, which is what we're doing. And we'll look forward to sharing more about that in June. Thanks, David. Thank you, Mandeep [ph]. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I know it was a busy one, and we appreciate your time and attention. We look forward to staying in touch with you. I just want to give a final remark and thank the entire PG&E team for delivering an outstanding 2023 for customers. They deliver for our hometowns. We're serving our planet, and we're leading with love at PG&E, and I couldn't be more proud to stand alongside with the men and women of PG&E to do just that. So feel really great about our turnaround. We know that, that turnaround is on track. Thanks to all those great people here at the company, and we look forward to seeing all of you in the coming months and definitely in June, on June 12 in New York. Thanks so much. Have a safe day."

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the PG&E Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Release. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Jonathan Arnold, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E\u2019s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today\u2019s third quarter presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report another quarter of solid progress. As you\u2019ll see on Slide three, our core earnings per share of $0.24 for the third quarter bring us to $0.76 for the first 9 months of 2023. We continue to work through the review process of our general rate case at the California Public Utilities Commission and have, therefore, not yet recognized the benefit in our earnings. With the customary memo account in place, once we receive the final order, we will book the new GRC revenues starting from the January 1, 2023 effective date. As you may know, our general rate case is on the agenda for CPUC\u2019s November 2 voting meeting next week, and we trust that the commission appreciates the importance of reaching a timely and constructive resolution, one which provides sufficient cash flow to support the critical work we have in front of us. If the GRC is not voted out next week, there are two further voting meetings in November one on the 16th and one on the 30th. Resolving our GRC will be a key milestone as it sets our CPUC base revenue through 2026. While we await the final decision, our memo account allows us to reaffirm our 2023 guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23. We also reaffirm our commitment to at least 10% earnings per share growth in 2024 and at least 9% in both 2025 and 2026, along with our plan for no new equity issuance through 2024. Looking ahead, once we have the final GRC decision, we anticipate scheduling a follow-up investor call, and we look forward to providing you with a more granular update on our financial plan at the time. Then on our year-end call in February, you should expect further detail around our investment plans. With respect to reinstating our common dividend, we recognize how important this is to traditional utility and income investors, and we look forward to recommending this important step to our Board soon. Turning back to our GRC. In our filed comments with the CPUC as well as in our public advocacy, we have been vocal that we view the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision or PD and the assigned commissioner\u2019s alternate proposal proposed decision, or APD, as falling short of providing the funding to accomplish the necessary safety work we have proposed on behalf of customers. As we have said, we are disappointed at the PDs apparent willingness to trade safety and reliability for short-term cost considerations. This is critical work, and in many cases, work that is required for us to execute on the safety commitments we make in our annual wildfire mitigation plan or under other regulatory orders. One good example, and there are others, is that the current PDs declined to fund over $260 million of capital for corrective maintenance of our gas meters. This work is not optional and is, in fact, required for compliance with CPUC General Order 58-A, which sets the state-wide standards for gas service in California. Unless the CPUC makes meaningful changes to the cash flow elements of the current PDs, we will have to slow down making our system safer and delay meeting legislative directives and regulatory requirements. My management team and I stand for delivering safety, reliability and affordability. We believe that our plan, thanks to the simple affordable model offers a clear pathway to keep build growth well below the current level of inflation at 2% to 4% annually over the rate case period. The CPUC\u2019s GRC process is designed to get the best outcome, and the state has been very clear about the infrastructure they want us to build. We stand by our filing and continue to view our undergrounding plan as the fastest and most affordable path to keep our customers safe. To that end, we have been encouraged by significant statements of support received from our local leaders and stakeholders. Aside from the GRC on Slide four, we continue to mitigate physical and financial risk. On the physical side, we\u2019re pleased with our continued progress mitigating wildfire risk through our layers of protection strategy. This remains at the heart of our plan, and we stand unapologetically on the side of public safety. In Sacramento, this year\u2019s legislative session included a number of bills which sought to address the very real challenges utilities have had keeping up with customer growth. Since our last update, the SB 410 Energization Bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Newsom. We viewed SB 410 as a constructive solution, allowing us to deliver the necessary work for our customers with more timely cost recovery. One key provision is for the CPUC to establish a ratemaking mechanism allowing for recovery of energization investment above what is approved in our GRC. We believe this is appropriate given the fast-moving and unpredictable nature of electrification-related customer demand and emerging and high-quality problem for any utility would love to have. In the newly opened Phase 2 of our GRC, we\u2019ve proposed a new balancing account to implement the provisions of SB 410. Keeping affordability in mind, our proposal would cap annual incremental customer bill impact at 2.5% of electric distribution rates. This could amount to over $200 million of annual revenue, supporting close to $1.5 billion of increase of incremental capital investment. The ratemaking mechanism in addition to the GRC authorized funding will allow an estimated 300-plus distribution capacity projects and over 35,000 new business connections over the next three years if the proposed rate-making mechanism is adopted. As with the pending GRC decision, it\u2019s critical that the Phase 2 proceeding support the necessary cash flow and timely resolution to do the work our legislature has directed and on the time line our customers are requesting. Since our last call, we\u2019ve also made progress on legacy legal risk, reaching a settlement with the CPUC\u2019s Safety and Enforcement Division with respect to the Dixie fire. This was for $45 million, most to be spent on the new electronic record system over five years. We continue to maintain we were a prudent operator and our settlement with SED specifically preserves our ability to apply for cost recovery, both from the CPUC and from the state Wildfire Fund. Turning to Slide five. Our layers of protection strategy continue to underpin our approach to wildfire risk as we strive to make our communities safer each and every day. We\u2019ve now completed the work, which improves our risk reduction from 90% at the start of the year to 94%, in line with our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan. Much of this year\u2019s improvement relates to installing down conductor detection technology, supplementing our enhanced power line safety settings and public safety power shutoff programs. Other improvements this year include securing AFA [Ph] approval for beyond line of sight drone inspections and integration of artificial intelligence for smoke detection on 610 cameras covering over 91% of PG&E\u2019s high fire risk areas. Our latest wildfire mitigation plan is working through the review process with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety or OEIS. Last month, we submitted our supplemental response to their revision notice and their updated schedule calls for a draft decision by November 14 with a final decision by December 29. As directed, we\u2019re expecting to file for our 2023 safety certificate by December 12. And remember that under AB 1054, the current certificate remains in full force, while OEIS reviews the new request. Turning slide six. Let\u2019s review our wildfire season performance to date. First, we are pleased to report that we are on track with our primary goal of zero catastrophic wildfire ignitions associated with PG&E equipment. As of October 22, CPUC reportable admissions in our high-risk zones are down 27% from last year and down 67% from 2017. The extended period of winter storms we experienced in 2023 certainly delayed the start of fire season, but this also led to an abundance of growth and fuel once conditions dried out. While we are really pleased with the headline data, variances and weather conditions from year-to-year can create some comparability challenges. To account for this, we track a weather-normalized ignition rate. We expressed this as ignitions per 100,000 circuit mile days under R3 or higher conditions, as measured by our Fire Potential Index. We\u2019ve seen the ignition rate decline by 70% overall since 2017, including significant step-downs in 2021 and 2022, validating our layers of protection approach. This year, through mid-October, I am pleased to report that we\u2019ve seen our weather-normalized ignition rate come down by a further 7% versus 2022. One point I want to reinforce, at PG&E, we\u2019re ready every day for dangerous conditions. Our layers of protection do not rely on weather being in our favor. We\u2019ve implemented state-of-the-art situational readiness technology, tools and people -- we treat every day as a high-risk day. This is the mind-set that will protect our customers and our communities. No matter the conditions we are ready. A good example is our use of public safety power shutoffs. Last year, we didn\u2019t need to activate any PSPS events since we did not experience sufficiently high-risk wind conditions. This year, we\u2019ve initiated two PSPS events, one in August and one in September, and both were quite localized. Through our enhanced situational awareness, which breaks the system down into 2-kilometer polygons, along with our extensive use of data and advanced meteorology, we are continuing to refine our PSPS capabilities. Our program is now far more surgical than when we first rolled it out in 2018. Because of those improvements, our PSPS events only affected around 3,900 customers in August and 1,200 in September. Our post-event analysis shows that our 2023 shutoffs prevented two likely ignitions and close to 30,000 acres, which might have otherwise burned. We are standing for our hometown and are resolved the catastrophic wildfires shall stop. PSPS and EPSS our enhanced Powerline safety settings program have been very effective at reducing ignitions. But both present unacceptable reliability challenges for customers. That\u2019s why we see undergrounding as the right long-term infrastructure for the very specific high-risk miles identified in our 10,000-mile plan and affordable for customers at $3.40 per month for the average noncare residential customers. In fact, based on our analysis over the expected life of the assets to be installed during the GRC period, our proposal returns billions of dollars more in net present value compared to the APD. Just like our layers of physical protection, our financial plan also includes multiple layers of protection as illustrated on Slide seven. The orange wedge represents the difference between the APD rate base and our guidance midpoint. Most critically, our layers of protection include improving on the cash elements of the rate case PDs, which we are working hard to do in our advocacy. There are also three items where the PDs do not recommend this allowances, but instead shift cost recovery into other future proceedings. These include future Whimsy [Ph] or equivalent filings incremental spending on energization as provided under SB 410 and our 10-year undergrounding plan under SB 884. We also see no shortage of incremental investment headroom in our FERC jurisdiction rate base. Keep in mind that capital investment for the benefit of customers\u2019 needs can be offset with O&M reductions and efficient financing, along with low growth to make sure safe infrastructure is also affordable. This is the heart of our simple, affordable model. Our regulators and key stakeholders are just becoming familiar with this model. And we must implement it in a very trustworthy way so that California can have the modern infrastructure in place that keeps people safe and energized, which takes me to my story of the month on Slide eight. A couple of weeks ago, I visited a site in Vacaville, where my co-workers are burying lines in a high-fire threat area. The project manager and field engineer were on site and could not have been more excited about what they were accomplishing for their home talent. This undergrounding project was originally estimated to cost close to $3.5 million a mile with a completion date in 2024. The team is now estimating a unit cost of approximately $2.9 million a mile and finishing in early December. Using Lean and the principles of waste elimination, my co-workers found opportunities to reduce materials and labor costs by challenging the status quo. They reduce trench depth and width while staying in compliance with county standards and they found additional cost savings during the backfill process. The combination of these solutions brought down the unit cost and they reduced total active construction time, making it safer, faster and reducing the impact on the community. As you can imagine, each project comes with its unique challenges, and this one was no different. What is different now at PG&E is the standard set of tools and the mind-set that my co-workers bring to every job. It\u2019s consistent application of lean and problem solving that drives predictable and in some cases, extraordinary breakthrough results no matter what challenges we face. Sticking with undergrounding, I should note that we currently have more than 2,000 qualified personnel working safely on undergrounding in our service territory every day. Earlier this month, we announced that we had finished 100% of the heavy construction work necessary to complete the 350 miles targeted for this year. We expect to energize an average of 20 additional miles per week through the end of the year, and I could not be prouder of the team for overcoming the significant challenges presented by the weather we experienced earlier this year. Day by day, week by week, we are managing our progress, leveraging visual management and operating reviews, giving me the confidence to affirm that we are right on track with our plan for 2023 and with line of sight running well into 2024. And with that, let me hand you over to Carolyn for our financial highlights.\nCarolyn Burke: Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I\u2019ll cover three main topics with you. Our 2023 year-to-date results, why we feel confident reaffirming our year-end and longer-term outlook and our simple affordable model. Let\u2019s start with our 2023 report card here on slide nine. As Patti discussed earlier, we are solidly on track with our operational metrics. We also have confidence that we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitments. Today, we are reaffirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23, along with our EPS growth target of at least 10% for 2024 and at least 9% for 2025 and 2026. We are also reaffirming our commitment to no new equity in 2023 or 2024. We may have noticed our Amber dial signaling a potential challenge to reaching our FFO to debt target in 2024. While we remain committed to achieving our mid-teens FFO to debt as quickly as possible, as discussed in our public comments throughout the past several weeks, the PD and APD in our general rate case fall short on cash flow in two notable areas. First, both the PD and APD extend the amortization period for collecting our incremental 2023 revenue increases to 36 months, packing an additional 2 years onto our requested 12-month collection period. This longer amortization period pushes out cash flow and unnecessarily burdens customers in the form of additional interest cost. Second, the APD allows only 25% of the customary inflation index adjustment, which risks lowering the pace of our balance sheet recovery as intervening parties acknowledge that last week\u2019s oral argument, our request and the index supporting it are consistent with commission precedent. Taken together, these cuts will constrain future cash flows. And as we\u2019ve said to the commission, we will be forced to make some difficult choices on what priority work to dial back on and what to complete. We simply are not willing to compromise on safety. Nor can the state afford to see us take a step backwards in terms of the progress we\u2019ve made improving our credit metrics. As Patti mentioned, we are advocating strongly for improvements in the PD. And we trust the CPU understands the importance of a financially healthy utility, just as we understand the importance of keeping bills affordable for customers. The simple affordable model makes both financial health and affordability possible. Turning to Slide 10. As we\u2019ve said, we are on track to meet our 2023 EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. On a year-to-date basis, our result is $0.76 per share, including $0.24 in the third quarter. During the first nine months of 2023, we\u2019ve realized $0.03 of favorability from operating and maintenance cost reductions, which we have fully redeployed right back into the business. And we\u2019re on track for at least our annual 2% nonfuel O&M reduction target. The $0.04 of timing is expected to fully reverse by year-end. And includes the typical tax driver, which results in variances between quarterly and annual earnings. This driver is even more pronounced this year as we await the final decision in our GRC. And the $0.04 of other has not changed from last quarter. Once we receive a final GRC decision, we will record the catch-up revenues supporting our customer capital investments for the full year 2023 as tracked in our approved memo accounts. This incremental catch-up revenue is the largest discrete driver of earnings that we project for the fourth quarter. As you may have seen, we have adjusted our accrual for the 2021 Dixie fire this quarter. Our focus continues to be on making it right for the victims, and we are making a non-cash increase to our accrual of $425 million to reflect our claims settlement experience to date. At the same time, we recorded an offsetting receivable from the state Wildfire Fund, reflecting our continued confidence in the protections provided by AB 1054. On Slide 11, our 10-year capital investment plan has not changed. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to advocate for improvements in the final outcome of our GRC. At the same time, we have several layers of financial protection to support our plan, including opportunities to seek cost recovery for the needed safety and reliability investments that our system requires. Our customers demand and which are legislative and regulatory stakeholder support. You can be sure that we\u2019re not taking our foot off the pedal to find and realize opportunities to further improve quality and reduce cost. Reducing costs and delivering more for our customers are core to our simple affordable model shown here on Slide 12. Coupled with load growth and efficient financing, this is how we plan to keep customer bills affordable. In fact, while we expect a step up in average customer bills in 2024 with the GRC implementation, our internal forecast for 2025 and 2026 show a declining bill trajectory. As we progress our lean tools, lower O&M costs and as legacy cost items, including [Indiscernible] recoveries roll off. This permits us to sustain average annual bill increases from 2023 through 2026 at or below assumed inflation in the 2% to 4% range, even with the first year GRC step up. Part of our affordable model is efficient financing. Our sale of a minority stake in our nonnuclear generating assets, Pacific Generation has received robust inbound interest for this attractive and unique portfolio. The regulatory record closed earlier this month and a PD is due early next year. We are targeting a transaction closing date in mid-2024. I\u2019ll end here on Slide 13, looking forward to 2024. On October 13, you saw this file an advice letter with the CPUC seeking to implement the cost of capital adjusted adjustment mechanism effective January 1, 2024, subject to commission disposition. Based on market interest rates, the mechanism has triggered, resulting in a formulaic 70 basis point upward adjustment to our return on equity and a 35 basis point upward adjustment to our cost of long-term debt. We believe the increase is well justified by market conditions. And if improved, we anticipate reinvesting any upside beyond our targeted earnings growth right back into the system for the benefit of our customers. On the same day, we also filed our TO21 rate case application with FERC seeking a 12.87% ROE, inclusive of the 50 basis point CAISO participation adder. A FERC order, except in the filing is expected by mid-December for rates to be effective January 1, 2024. Our filing includes $1.9 billion in forecasted capital additions during 2023 and 2024. As a reminder, a nice feature of our formula rate structure is the annual true-up mechanism, which adjusts rates to reflect actual costs, including customer capital investment, which, as we\u2019ve said, is an area where we see abundant growth opportunities. To summarize, we are mitigating both our physical and financial risk with layers of protection. Although we are concerned that the PDs and our GRC risk setting us back to -- in our quest to restore our credit ratings. We believe we can make our system safer faster and more affordable for our customers. At the same time, we are offering attractive earnings growth to investors. We are looking forward to reinstating our common dividend soon and we look forward to catching up with many of you at EEI next month. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, I just wanted to take a moment to review our regulatory and legislative time line shown here on Slide 14 and reflect on some of our highlights in 2023, starting with our wildfire self-insurance settlement in January which we see saving customers up to $1.8 billion through this 4-year GRC period. Other milestones include resolving our safety culture OII. Settlements with the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division for both the Zogg and the Dixie fires and over $1 billion of interim rate relief approved in our 2022 Wenzy [Ph] proceeding. We have plenty to look forward to as well. Key catalysts we can point to include resolving our GRC and achieving base revenue visibility through 2026, approval of our 2023 WMP and safety certificate, resolution of our GRC Phase 2 proposal to implement SB 410. Our 10-year undergrounding plan filing under SB 884, disposition of our cost of capital adjustment advice letter. The proposed decision on Pacific Generation and advancing our DOE loan application. That\u2019s a lot of value to come for customers as well as investors. In addition to regulatory catalysts, we look forward to further progress towards normalizing our financial profile. With the Fire Victim trust completing their sales, restoring our credit ratings to investment grade to unlock significant financing cost savings for customers and reinstating our common dividend. We believe these catalysts favorably differentiate the PG&E investment story anchored in our simple affordable model. Our strategy remains focused and is based on the foundational belief that a financially healthy and well-run PG&E can and will play a leading role in enabling the clean, affordable and resilient energy future to which the state of California and our customers aspire. We trust that you feel the momentum that we do. And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nShar Pourreza: Hey guys good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning, Patti. Just on the core drivers in the metric away from on track for FFO by 2024. I mean obviously, Carolyn mentioned in the prepared remarks, did I quote like you have to make some pretty difficult decisions, but most of your spending being somewhat crucial for the state. I guess what difficult decisions were you referring to? I guess, how do you manage this headwind under an assumption that the various rate requests are adverse and don\u2019t work into your planning assumptions? And could we see incremental equity as a result of that as you try to right size the metrics? Thanks.\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Thanks, Shar, for the question. These are all things, obviously, on our mind. Look, first of all, the process isn\u2019t finished. We\u2019re in the throes of completing the final decision for our rate case. We know how important it is. We also know the important work that we want to do for customers. And that is at the heart of what we requested in the rate case and the heart of our advocacy. In terms of difficult choices, I think what we look at, we see without the necessary cash flow, it definitely slows down our ability to complete the work, but we also know that we\u2019re committed to improving the health of our balance sheet. I\u2019ll address your equity point, but then I want to make a broader point about the regulatory environment here in California. First, on the equity point, we\u2019re still committed for sure, to our commitment to not issue equity through 2024. We stand by that plan. We know that issuing equity at this valuation is not good for customers. We need to make sure that we have the equity and access to the capital markets that attracts capital to California, so we can make those necessary investments. So we\u2019re standing by our plan there through 2024. But back to the construct and to your question about how do we make these choices. Look, the California regulatory construct is good. It has a lot to love and I\u2019ve learned that as I\u2019ve been here it provides many earnings mechanisms and provide certainty in those earnings mechanisms. Let me give you one example. We had these major storms back at the beginning of the year, like 14 storms in the first quarter. And we were able to recognize the revenue associated with covering the cost of those storms through our CEMA mechanism. But we don\u2019t collect the cash. There\u2019s a delay in that. And so that\u2019s the part that I think people are coming to terms with. Here in California, specifically about PG&E is that given our we\u2019re on a path to become healthy. We\u2019re on a path to recover our balance sheet. We\u2019re committed to FFO to debt in the mid-teens. In order to do that, we have to have timely cash recovery. And that\u2019s the point we\u2019ve been trying to make about these proposed decisions that they allow too much cash flow lag and we don\u2019t have a balance sheet that can afford that. I think a typical investment-grade utility can handle that buffer. And so the regulatory construct works. But given that we are in the situation we are with our credit metrics, we\u2019ve got to improve those credit metrics and this is essential to returning us to the position so that. And this is the part that\u2019s most important, Shar, so that we can do that necessary work on time. We don\u2019t want to have to slow down the deployment of the work. We don\u2019t want to have to make choices for customers about which essential work we do first. We want to be able to do that work in parallel. I have the work team -- I have the team here at PG&E who\u2019s ready to go, who can do that work for customers that can make the system safer, faster, but we need the cash flow. And so I think it\u2019s a new issue here in California. It\u2019s a new issue for our regulators to deal with the fact that our credit ratings are where they are. But we do see a path that if we all work together. And if PG&E proves itself trustworthy as we work to do every day, and I think the progress we\u2019ve made to date is starting to provide that evidence that we can do what we said we\u2019re going to do. That we have earned the right to be trusted to deploy this cash to the best benefit of customers, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on doing Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Got it, Pat. And then just lastly for me on Slide 7, you pointed out that the APD run you in the bottom half of the rate base guidance. Can you just comment on the cadence of the customer investments that you back that gets you back to the midpoint? What are, I guess, some of the more additive construct? Is it SB 410, is it WMCE? And if like this whole undergrounding issue is reduced I guess, how long would it take you to ramp up to that 10-year plan, especially there seems to be a lot of stakeholders pushing back on the undergrounding costs. Thanks a lot guys.\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Good question, Shar. Thank you. I would say, first of all, these new mechanisms, particularly those that are reflected in the new legislation, SB 410 and last year\u2019s legislation around undergrounding do provide for us to do the work. But again, it all comes back to our access to cash and the cash flow. And so we think that we definitely can catch up on the work and do the work if we have the cash. And so that\u2019s an important role that these PDs play as we move forward. I will also say that on the undergrounding specifically, it\u2019s a relatively small cost in the overall rate case. So in terms of customer cost, as we\u2019ve calculated and have been sharing $3.40 a month is the impact to customers at the peak of the rate case for customers to do the undergrounding. And the customers I talked to are pretty excited about us doing that work. And so we continue to make the case that undergrounding in very specific miles. And I think it seems to some in some cases, it feels like people are trying to do an all or nothing. It\u2019s either we do undergrounding or we do covered conductor. The reality is we have 1,000 miles of covered conductor, there are places on our system where covered conductor is the right choice. What we\u2019re talking about is a very specific highest-risk miles with a very unique geography, particularly suspect for vegetation strike. And that vegetation management expense that we are doing every year customers have to pay for. And I think people don\u2019t understand it actually is less expensive to do the undergrounding. And people understand it costs something $3.40 a month, but it will cost more to continue to do vegetation management and overhead hardening and the maintenance of those overhead lines in these specific areas. So we continue to make the case. Look, Shar, we see a path forward to do all of the necessary work that our customers have been begging us to do. We\u2019re excited about being able to do that work, and we\u2019re sure that we can get to a good constructive outcome with our regulators.\nShar Pourreza: Fantastic guys. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Appreciate it.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Your line is open.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes, thanks hi, good morning. So the -- you talked about the -- obviously, to get more cash, there\u2019d be more rate increase upfront, but then you talked about the declining bill trajectory and rollover and such that, obviously, you need to do the work and you want to get into that declining build trajectory. Could you just talk about that aspect and some of the things that help in 2025, 2026?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, you bet. Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Steve. And I also think it\u2019s something that\u2019s been hard to understand in all of the public comments and advocacy. Look, there\u2019s some catch-up that needs to be done here. And in California, we have this construct where we need to do necessary work and the utility bears the risk of doing all the wildfire preventive work. And so there are some onetime short-term costs that are embedded in the early years of this rate proceeding. But as the years progress, then those things come out of the bill. So for example, as we do the recovery of the 2023 revenues that obviously needs to be captured then. And our proposal is a 12-month capture in 2024. So if you can imagine a customer would be collecting bills in 2024, that we are paying bills in 2024 that reflect 2024 and 2023s revenue. And then that comes off. And then the bills come down significantly. And so what we\u2019re -- the point we\u2019re trying to make is that there is some catch-up in this, but bills can definitely improve, that\u2019s just math. But what I think is really important and the part that people don\u2019t necessarily yet appreciate about the new PG&E model is our simple affordable model. This is not just a slogan, it\u2019s not just a thing we say, this is something that we do every day. And that is funding capital investment through cost savings, cost reduction we have had dramatic cost improvements already on our undergrounding, on our vegetation management. Our next big hurdle is our system inspections. We\u2019ve got major improvements that we can make there. Then we add in the efficient financing. Look, getting our credit ratings in the right place will save customers money, not spreading out the collection of the 2023 revenues over 3 and 4 years will save customers money. We have the ability to reduce costs in the bills, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on every day. I think that\u2019s a new habit, a new pattern for PG&E to be recognized for. And so I can appreciate that regulators and others have questions and wonder if that\u2019s actually what we\u2019re going to do. All I can say, Steve, I think you know my track record, we can do real cost savings that benefit customers while we\u2019re making these very necessary investments in the infrastructure.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then just -- could you just go through the steps here. So the GRCs on the agenda for the meeting next week. Is that mean they likely will rule or could they delay it? And could we still get another alternate? Or are we likely just going to kind of get a final order.\nPatti Poppe: Well we\u2019re hopeful, Steve, that November 2 reflects a final decision. But what\u2019s on our mind is we want to make sure that it\u2019s the right final decision. And so -- if -- I think there\u2019s still two meetings, November 16 and November 30. If in fact, they wanted to take more time to get it right. But we\u2019re hopeful that November 2 represents a final decision.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay, great. Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: The next question is from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Your line is open.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey thanks for taking the question. I guess just very clear on the FFO to debt disclosures here, but just can you elaborate on just the agency conversations on the path to IG right here right now? And how we should think about if this PD is adopted your path to get there? Thanks.\nCarolyn Burke: Yes. Thanks for the question. We have been in continuous conversation with the rating agencies about our rating. And we\u2019ve actually already spoken to them about the GRC and the PDs and the impact on FFO to debt. But we\u2019ve also talked to them about our commitment to achieving mid-teens in 2024 and other ways that we can get there if we need to. But it is challenged, and it\u2019s going to slow -- it will slow our progress on our balance sheet. So the path to get there really is about FFO to debt and getting to at least the 13% to the 14%, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re committed to doing over the course of the next 2 years for sure, and we\u2019re committed to getting to mid-teens by the end of 2024.\nNicholas Campanella: That\u2019s helpful. And I think you also said in regards to the wildfire fund, you booked like a $400 million and change receivable. Is this the first time the fund has been tapped? And correct me if I\u2019m wrong there, but just what\u2019s the process around actually receiving that?\nCarolyn Burke: So we haven\u2019t actually tapped the wildfire fund. So on the Dixie accrual, we did increase the accrual by $425 million. We have an accrual of $1.6 billion in total at this point in time. But what\u2019s important is that you can\u2019t tap the fund until you actually -- until we have actually paid out $1 billion in settlement. So to date, we have a 730 -- we\u2019ve settled around $730 million, and we\u2019ve paid out $575 million. So we have a ways to go to fully paying out $1 billion. But the statute limitations on Dixie actually runs out in October of 2024. So we are in preparing for that filing as we speak and working with the fund on how to ensure a smooth of a process as possible.\nPatti Poppe: And this is Patti. I\u2019ll just add in. So no, it hasn\u2019t been done before, Nicolas. And so we\u2019re working through what that process will be. And so that\u2019s not perfectly clear, but I do want to remind everyone that the benefits of AB 1054, there\u2019s -- it\u2019s a fundamental change in California that really helps create the certainty required to number one, prevent a liquidity issue in the event of a significant incident. It allows us if, in fact, we had did have to, in a hurry, get access to that fund, we could access it to pay third-party damages. But as Carolyn said, it\u2019s actually -- it takes time to settle and to pay out those settlements, but the enhanced prudency standard that comes with AB 1054 is another enhancement that will be good to see as we move forward here. And so I think there\u2019s a lot to appreciate about AB 1054 and the protections it provides and the certainty it allows for here in California as we do this necessary safety work to make the system safer faster.\nCarolyn Burke: Yes. And I\u2019ll just remind you that we also just -- we did record an offsetting receivable for that -- for the state wildfire fund for that accrual?\nNicholas Campanella: Yes. Thank you for the clarification and [Indiscernible] thanks.\nCarolyn Burke: Thanks, Nicholas.\nOperator: The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning, team. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate the time. Just first off here, on the undergrounding and the timing-related matter here. I mean, obviously, sort of for the purpose of efficiency, you want to keep this going in a more linear fashion and you guys are up and going here. Do you want to talk about sort of funding and ensuring consistency and execution through the near term, barring whatever comes out in some subsequent process here on longer-term undergrounding. Obviously, you\u2019ve carefully negotiated the -- with the various contractors in the medium term here, if you don\u2019t mind.\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Well, first and foremost, let me be clear, we won\u2019t do work that the commission didn\u2019t fund. And so our plan right now is the most efficient plan we agree. We have done negotiations with contractors. We\u2019ve developed a workforce. As I mentioned in the script, I\u2019ve got 2,000 people right now today, doing undergrounding and those people are skilled and qualified -- boy, I don\u2019t want to tell them that they have to step off the job. But the reality is we\u2019ve got 350 miles planned for this year, and we\u2019ve got engineering in the hopper to prepare us for next year\u2019s 450-mile target. And then we\u2019re focused on 550 miles in 2025 and 750 miles in 2026, but all of this is contingent upon regulator approval. So if the CPUC decides we should do less undergrounding or to slow down the path, it will cost more for customers, but obviously, we\u2019ll take their direction, and we\u2019ll then file our 10-year plan and make sure that it does its best job of compelling a more favorable decision to get the scale because that\u2019s the beauty of what we\u2019ve observed already, just like the story of the month that I shared on the call, we are finding savings on every job. And scale is essential to realizing those savings for customers. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s on our mind as we move forward. We will be filing that 10-year plan when the OEIS is prepared to receive it.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Exactly. And maybe the point is, to the extent which that has a process that could take a couple of years here. If you really want to be watching your ability and/or rather the commission\u2019s decision tree on not just 2024 but also 2025 in terms of what\u2019s right in the near term?\nPatti Poppe: Yes, exactly. We certainly don\u2019t want to come to a cold hard stop. Like we want to be able to keep moving and keep the acceleration of the benefits for customers rolling every mile buried as another mile of risk virtually eliminated. And so we\u2019re really focused on these very specific miles and getting these specific miles done as soon as possible to protect the people of California, and we think we can do that at a very affordable price.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And Patti, just following up on our prior conversation on SB 410 and enabling timely interconnect. I mean, do you want to talk about how that bolsters the cash flow conversation you had a second ago here on the call vis-a-vis ratings and targets?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. We\u2019re very grateful for the legislature and the great work that they did this year in recognizing that when you do a 4-year forward-looking rate making, you don\u2019t -- you can\u2019t perfectly predict the demand that we\u2019re actually experiencing. And so as demand increases, SB 410 allows for an annual true-up of recoveries for the work that needs to be done to enable electric vehicle transition to electrification in the state. And I\u2019m very proud of my team. We\u2019ve been working hard to improve our own process while we get the necessary funding. What\u2019s important is that we are able to do our work more timely. And so here\u2019s some news from this year we delivered a 17% increase in volume of requests this year. So in 2022, we did 7,900 new business connections. We\u2019re up to 9,200 here in 2023. So that\u2019s a 17% increase. Really proud of the team, things all of our lean operating system being put to work, have deployed things like we are estimating, which is our engineering and work preparation is a critical part, but can be a bottleneck in the process. That team has gone to work reimagining how they do estimating, and they\u2019ve reduced their cycle time from 116 days down to 71 days. I mean that\u2019s a 50% improvement in really a 1-year focused effort. So the ability for us to improve throughput and meet the needs of customers is real. We\u2019re starting to prove to people that we can, again, do what we said we\u2019re going to do and the cash flow that\u2019s enabled by SB 410 is helpful because it\u2019s more timely, but there is still a year\u2019s lag. And so again, we\u2019ve got to get these credit ratings back up into investment grade so that we can attract the debt markets at the lowest cost for customers. And this whole -- the plan hangs together extremely well when we are -- when we have a balance sheet to fund all this really important work that we need to do for customers.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: The next question is from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Your line is open.\nGregg Orrill: Yes, thank you good morning. On PacGen [Ph] I know there\u2019s been a lot of support in the process. Could you sort of remind us about what has to happen to close the transaction from here and any sort of risks or concerns you might have around it? Thank you.\nCarolyn Burke: Yes, good morning. Thanks for the question. So PacGen is on track. We\u2019re following the process, as we\u2019ve mentioned, that we had kicked off our Phase 1 of the sales process at the end of June and July, and we\u2019re now in what we would call Phase 2. So we\u2019re tracking the marketing and sales process right along with the regulatory process. I think the major milestone on the regulatory really is that the PD is due in January of are within 90 days of the record closing, which occurred on October 5, 2023. So we still expect the closing to occur in the first half of we have seen very robust interest from what we expected in terms of interest in these very unique differentiated assets, largely from infrastructure funds, but we\u2019re pleased with the interest and still expect the time line to be as we\u2019ve discussed in past earnings calls.\nPatti Poppe: And I\u2019ll add. This is Patti. The PacGen the whole purpose of that is for efficient financing for customers. And so this is a good example of how we\u2019re not just counting on others. We\u2019re not just counting on the regulators to fix our balance sheet. There are things self-action that we can take that we are taking that is really intended to help enable customers to get the value that they\u2019re demanding, the value they deserve in this infrastructure that we have the privilege to build for them. And so this is just another example of our simple affordable model, efficient financing as a piece of the puzzle to make sure that we can invest in the infrastructure and save customers money. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re up to on this transaction.\nGregg Orrill: Okay, good wishes.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Gregg.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. Your line is open.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. As the company engages the CPUC ahead of the November 2 potential decision, is the company open to accelerating or open to committing to accelerate the undergrounding of the top 5% risk lines. And to the extent that permitting is a limitation, is there a political solution that could help advance both the company and key stakeholders\u2019 interest on this front?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Our plan is dynamic enough that in 2025 and 2026, we can adjust the miles and make sure that they\u2019re mutually agreeable, if you will. I will say that as we designed the sequencing of the miles, we picked -- well -- and let me just start with every mile in the 10,000 miles is high risk. So if you do mile 8,000 or mile 2000, you\u2019re still tackling a high-risk mile. So we\u2019ll start with that. But as we sequence those 10,000 miles, we did include the adjacent miles that also will be underground for an efficiency. That\u2019s how we get to the lower unit cost. But if there\u2019s certain miles that the regulators instruct us to do sooner as we work with OEIS on our risk reduction plan will definitely be prioritized. We definitely are focused on making sure that the system is safe today because of our mechanisms like EPSS and public safety power shutoffs but those cause outages. The public safety power shutoffs and the EPSS mechanisms are working. We showed that with our ignition reduction. And so we know customers are safe today, but we want them to be resilient. We don\u2019t want customers to have to choose between having safety or having power. We want them to have both and undergrounding as the lowest cost path to that future.\nRyan Levine: I appreciate the response. And then one other unrelated. In terms of the details on SB 410 impact, what is the nature of the 300-plus projects highlighted in the prepared remarks, any color you could share there?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. So we have demands every day on capacity increases, EV charging infrastructure. And so that\u2019s just -- and that demands some of that we can\u2019t -- we don\u2019t know the project request yet because it will come in a very -- it happens all the time. And so that\u2019s the point about SB 410. We can\u2019t perfectly predict what those 300 projects would be. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t need the mechanism. Because it comes in as EV penetration increases to meet the state\u2019s direction as EV charging infrastructure gets built out. That will vary year after year. And so that\u2019s the beauty of SB 410, whatever the demand is, we can meet it. And we won\u2019t recover more than we install, we\u2019ll just have good timely true-up of that work that gets demanded by customers. And so that\u2019s more of a calculated 300 than actual specific 300 projects. .\nRyan Levine: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning. Richard Sunderland on for Jeremy. Can you hear me?\nPatti Poppe: We sure can. Good morning.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Thank you. Slide 7, I know we\u2019ve parsed this from a couple of different angles, but I just wanted to circle back to those categories broadly under customer investments. Could you speak a little bit more to, I guess, timing and dollar of those? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s best if they\u2019ve gone sort of a cash basis or a CapEx basis. But when you might have clarity on some of those should the PD or APD stand as it is today?\nPatti Poppe: Yes. Well, we\u2019ll be working that. First and foremost, we think a revision to the PD will be good and enable us to do more faster, so number one. Number two, though, as we look at the SB 410, that\u2019s going to be driven by customer demand, and that\u2019s good work to be done. Our whimsy proceedings, we\u2019ll continue to file those on a timely basis. Those certainly help with cash flow. It\u2019s a good example of a delayed recovery that doesn\u2019t affect earnings, but it certainly affects our credit metrics and our balance sheet. And so WIMS [Ph] will be important to be resolved in a timely manner. But the 10-year undergrounding plan just provides the pathway to the lowest cost safest infrastructure. And then certainly, FERC transmission, as you saw, we filed our TO filing earlier in October. We\u2019ll continue to leverage the ability to do that at those transmission projects as well as key components of the whole picture. One of the things that is really important to understand is I rattle off all those things, there is so much work to be done here. Work that customers deserve work that customers will greatly value and benefit from work that customers have been asking us to do for some time. And so what\u2019s important to recognize is we always self-regulate the volume of work we do on customers\u2019 ability to afford. That is the simple affordable model. That we can invest in this capital infrastructure as indicated in -- on Slide 7, but we offset it with cost savings for customers every single day. And so those cost savings is what makes it possible to grow rate base like that without putting an undue burden on customers and their ability to pay. So it\u2019s value for customers and cost savings that make up that simple, affordable model, good for customers, good for investors.\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. Very helpful. And maybe since you referenced the 21 application, curious if there are any notable request in that beyond ROE and cap structure? Any other potential areas you\u2019re focused on with that?\nPatti Poppe: No, it\u2019s good bread and butter transmission investment, stuff that helps enable the clean energy transition that\u2019s happening here in California and work that improves both reliability and access to that clean energy.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Thanks very much for the time.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn it back over to Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer of PG&E for any closing remarks.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Chris. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We definitely enjoy this time together, but we appreciate certainly your patience on this GRC. It has a long-term impact. And it is worth the way to get it right and to make sure that we are aligned with our regulators. We all want the same thing. We want the safest system as fast as possible that customers can afford. And so we\u2019re working together to get to a good outcome and we appreciate your patience. We will hold a special call once we have a final decision to review the details and share more of our insights when we get to a final resolution. We look forward to seeing you at EEI and please be safe out there.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carolyn Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover three main topics with you. Our 2023 year-to-date results, why we feel confident reaffirming our year-end and longer-term outlook and our simple affordable model. Let's start with our 2023 report card here on slide nine. As Patti discussed earlier, we are solidly on track with our operational metrics. We also have confidence that we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitments. Today, we are reaffirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23, along with our EPS growth target of at least 10% for 2024 and at least 9% for 2025 and 2026. We are also reaffirming our commitment to no new equity in 2023 or 2024. We may have noticed our Amber dial signaling a potential challenge to reaching our FFO to debt target in 2024. While we remain committed to achieving our mid-teens FFO to debt as quickly as possible, as discussed in our public comments throughout the past several weeks, the PD and APD in our general rate case fall short on cash flow in two notable areas. First, both the PD and APD extend the amortization period for collecting our incremental 2023 revenue increases to 36 months, packing an additional 2 years onto our requested 12-month collection period. This longer amortization period pushes out cash flow and unnecessarily burdens customers in the form of additional interest cost. Second, the APD allows only 25% of the customary inflation index adjustment, which risks lowering the pace of our balance sheet recovery as intervening parties acknowledge that last week's oral argument, our request and the index supporting it are consistent with commission precedent. Taken together, these cuts will constrain future cash flows. And as we've said to the commission, we will be forced to make some difficult choices on what priority work to dial back on and what to complete. We simply are not willing to compromise on safety. Nor can the state afford to see us take a step backwards in terms of the progress we've made improving our credit metrics. As Patti mentioned, we are advocating strongly for improvements in the PD. And we trust the CPU understands the importance of a financially healthy utility, just as we understand the importance of keeping bills affordable for customers. The simple affordable model makes both financial health and affordability possible. Turning to Slide 10. As we've said, we are on track to meet our 2023 EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. On a year-to-date basis, our result is $0.76 per share, including $0.24 in the third quarter. During the first nine months of 2023, we've realized $0.03 of favorability from operating and maintenance cost reductions, which we have fully redeployed right back into the business. And we're on track for at least our annual 2% nonfuel O&M reduction target. The $0.04 of timing is expected to fully reverse by year-end. And includes the typical tax driver, which results in variances between quarterly and annual earnings. This driver is even more pronounced this year as we await the final decision in our GRC. And the $0.04 of other has not changed from last quarter. Once we receive a final GRC decision, we will record the catch-up revenues supporting our customer capital investments for the full year 2023 as tracked in our approved memo accounts. This incremental catch-up revenue is the largest discrete driver of earnings that we project for the fourth quarter. As you may have seen, we have adjusted our accrual for the 2021 Dixie fire this quarter. Our focus continues to be on making it right for the victims, and we are making a non-cash increase to our accrual of $425 million to reflect our claims settlement experience to date. At the same time, we recorded an offsetting receivable from the state Wildfire Fund, reflecting our continued confidence in the protections provided by AB 1054. On Slide 11, our 10-year capital investment plan has not changed. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to advocate for improvements in the final outcome of our GRC. At the same time, we have several layers of financial protection to support our plan, including opportunities to seek cost recovery for the needed safety and reliability investments that our system requires. Our customers demand and which are legislative and regulatory stakeholder support. You can be sure that we're not taking our foot off the pedal to find and realize opportunities to further improve quality and reduce cost. Reducing costs and delivering more for our customers are core to our simple affordable model shown here on Slide 12. Coupled with load growth and efficient financing, this is how we plan to keep customer bills affordable. In fact, while we expect a step up in average customer bills in 2024 with the GRC implementation, our internal forecast for 2025 and 2026 show a declining bill trajectory. As we progress our lean tools, lower O&M costs and as legacy cost items, including [Indiscernible] recoveries roll off. This permits us to sustain average annual bill increases from 2023 through 2026 at or below assumed inflation in the 2% to 4% range, even with the first year GRC step up. Part of our affordable model is efficient financing. Our sale of a minority stake in our nonnuclear generating assets, Pacific Generation has received robust inbound interest for this attractive and unique portfolio. The regulatory record closed earlier this month and a PD is due early next year. We are targeting a transaction closing date in mid-2024. I'll end here on Slide 13, looking forward to 2024. On October 13, you saw this file an advice letter with the CPUC seeking to implement the cost of capital adjusted adjustment mechanism effective January 1, 2024, subject to commission disposition. Based on market interest rates, the mechanism has triggered, resulting in a formulaic 70 basis point upward adjustment to our return on equity and a 35 basis point upward adjustment to our cost of long-term debt. We believe the increase is well justified by market conditions. And if improved, we anticipate reinvesting any upside beyond our targeted earnings growth right back into the system for the benefit of our customers. On the same day, we also filed our TO21 rate case application with FERC seeking a 12.87% ROE, inclusive of the 50 basis point CAISO participation adder. A FERC order, except in the filing is expected by mid-December for rates to be effective January 1, 2024. Our filing includes $1.9 billion in forecasted capital additions during 2023 and 2024. As a reminder, a nice feature of our formula rate structure is the annual true-up mechanism, which adjusts rates to reflect actual costs, including customer capital investment, which, as we've said, is an area where we see abundant growth opportunities. To summarize, we are mitigating both our physical and financial risk with layers of protection. Although we are concerned that the PDs and our GRC risk setting us back to -- in our quest to restore our credit ratings. We believe we can make our system safer faster and more affordable for our customers. At the same time, we are offering attractive earnings growth to investors. We are looking forward to reinstating our common dividend soon and we look forward to catching up with many of you at EEI next month. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti. Yes. Thanks for the question. We have been in continuous conversation with the rating agencies about our rating. And we've actually already spoken to them about the GRC and the PDs and the impact on FFO to debt. But we've also talked to them about our commitment to achieving mid-teens in 2024 and other ways that we can get there if we need to. But it is challenged, and it's going to slow -- it will slow our progress on our balance sheet. So the path to get there really is about FFO to debt and getting to at least the 13% to the 14%, and that's what we're committed to doing over the course of the next 2 years for sure, and we're committed to getting to mid-teens by the end of 2024. So we haven't actually tapped the wildfire fund. So on the Dixie accrual, we did increase the accrual by $425 million. We have an accrual of $1.6 billion in total at this point in time. But what's important is that you can't tap the fund until you actually -- until we have actually paid out $1 billion in settlement. So to date, we have a 730 -- we've settled around $730 million, and we've paid out $575 million. So we have a ways to go to fully paying out $1 billion. But the statute limitations on Dixie actually runs out in October of 2024. So we are in preparing for that filing as we speak and working with the fund on how to ensure a smooth of a process as possible. Yes. And I'll just remind you that we also just -- we did record an offsetting receivable for that -- for the state wildfire fund for that accrual? Thanks, Nicholas. Yes, good morning. Thanks for the question. So PacGen is on track. We're following the process, as we've mentioned, that we had kicked off our Phase 1 of the sales process at the end of June and July, and we're now in what we would call Phase 2. So we're tracking the marketing and sales process right along with the regulatory process. I think the major milestone on the regulatory really is that the PD is due in January of are within 90 days of the record closing, which occurred on October 5, 2023. So we still expect the closing to occur in the first half of we have seen very robust interest from what we expected in terms of interest in these very unique differentiated assets, largely from infrastructure funds, but we're pleased with the interest and still expect the time line to be as we've discussed in past earnings calls."

            "name": "Patti Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid progress. As you'll see on Slide three, our core earnings per share of $0.24 for the third quarter bring us to $0.76 for the first 9 months of 2023. We continue to work through the review process of our general rate case at the California Public Utilities Commission and have, therefore, not yet recognized the benefit in our earnings. With the customary memo account in place, once we receive the final order, we will book the new GRC revenues starting from the January 1, 2023 effective date. As you may know, our general rate case is on the agenda for CPUC's November 2 voting meeting next week, and we trust that the commission appreciates the importance of reaching a timely and constructive resolution, one which provides sufficient cash flow to support the critical work we have in front of us. If the GRC is not voted out next week, there are two further voting meetings in November one on the 16th and one on the 30th. Resolving our GRC will be a key milestone as it sets our CPUC base revenue through 2026. While we await the final decision, our memo account allows us to reaffirm our 2023 guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23. We also reaffirm our commitment to at least 10% earnings per share growth in 2024 and at least 9% in both 2025 and 2026, along with our plan for no new equity issuance through 2024. Looking ahead, once we have the final GRC decision, we anticipate scheduling a follow-up investor call, and we look forward to providing you with a more granular update on our financial plan at the time. Then on our year-end call in February, you should expect further detail around our investment plans. With respect to reinstating our common dividend, we recognize how important this is to traditional utility and income investors, and we look forward to recommending this important step to our Board soon. Turning back to our GRC. In our filed comments with the CPUC as well as in our public advocacy, we have been vocal that we view the ALJ's proposed decision or PD and the assigned commissioner's alternate proposal proposed decision, or APD, as falling short of providing the funding to accomplish the necessary safety work we have proposed on behalf of customers. As we have said, we are disappointed at the PDs apparent willingness to trade safety and reliability for short-term cost considerations. This is critical work, and in many cases, work that is required for us to execute on the safety commitments we make in our annual wildfire mitigation plan or under other regulatory orders. One good example, and there are others, is that the current PDs declined to fund over $260 million of capital for corrective maintenance of our gas meters. This work is not optional and is, in fact, required for compliance with CPUC General Order 58-A, which sets the state-wide standards for gas service in California. Unless the CPUC makes meaningful changes to the cash flow elements of the current PDs, we will have to slow down making our system safer and delay meeting legislative directives and regulatory requirements. My management team and I stand for delivering safety, reliability and affordability. We believe that our plan, thanks to the simple affordable model offers a clear pathway to keep build growth well below the current level of inflation at 2% to 4% annually over the rate case period. The CPUC's GRC process is designed to get the best outcome, and the state has been very clear about the infrastructure they want us to build. We stand by our filing and continue to view our undergrounding plan as the fastest and most affordable path to keep our customers safe. To that end, we have been encouraged by significant statements of support received from our local leaders and stakeholders. Aside from the GRC on Slide four, we continue to mitigate physical and financial risk. On the physical side, we're pleased with our continued progress mitigating wildfire risk through our layers of protection strategy. This remains at the heart of our plan, and we stand unapologetically on the side of public safety. In Sacramento, this year's legislative session included a number of bills which sought to address the very real challenges utilities have had keeping up with customer growth. Since our last update, the SB 410 Energization Bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Newsom. We viewed SB 410 as a constructive solution, allowing us to deliver the necessary work for our customers with more timely cost recovery. One key provision is for the CPUC to establish a ratemaking mechanism allowing for recovery of energization investment above what is approved in our GRC. We believe this is appropriate given the fast-moving and unpredictable nature of electrification-related customer demand and emerging and high-quality problem for any utility would love to have. In the newly opened Phase 2 of our GRC, we've proposed a new balancing account to implement the provisions of SB 410. Keeping affordability in mind, our proposal would cap annual incremental customer bill impact at 2.5% of electric distribution rates. This could amount to over $200 million of annual revenue, supporting close to $1.5 billion of increase of incremental capital investment. The ratemaking mechanism in addition to the GRC authorized funding will allow an estimated 300-plus distribution capacity projects and over 35,000 new business connections over the next three years if the proposed rate-making mechanism is adopted. As with the pending GRC decision, it's critical that the Phase 2 proceeding support the necessary cash flow and timely resolution to do the work our legislature has directed and on the time line our customers are requesting. Since our last call, we've also made progress on legacy legal risk, reaching a settlement with the CPUC's Safety and Enforcement Division with respect to the Dixie fire. This was for $45 million, most to be spent on the new electronic record system over five years. We continue to maintain we were a prudent operator and our settlement with SED specifically preserves our ability to apply for cost recovery, both from the CPUC and from the state Wildfire Fund. Turning to Slide five. Our layers of protection strategy continue to underpin our approach to wildfire risk as we strive to make our communities safer each and every day. We've now completed the work, which improves our risk reduction from 90% at the start of the year to 94%, in line with our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan. Much of this year's improvement relates to installing down conductor detection technology, supplementing our enhanced power line safety settings and public safety power shutoff programs. Other improvements this year include securing AFA [Ph] approval for beyond line of sight drone inspections and integration of artificial intelligence for smoke detection on 610 cameras covering over 91% of PG&E's high fire risk areas. Our latest wildfire mitigation plan is working through the review process with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety or OEIS. Last month, we submitted our supplemental response to their revision notice and their updated schedule calls for a draft decision by November 14 with a final decision by December 29. As directed, we're expecting to file for our 2023 safety certificate by December 12. And remember that under AB 1054, the current certificate remains in full force, while OEIS reviews the new request. Turning slide six. Let's review our wildfire season performance to date. First, we are pleased to report that we are on track with our primary goal of zero catastrophic wildfire ignitions associated with PG&E equipment. As of October 22, CPUC reportable admissions in our high-risk zones are down 27% from last year and down 67% from 2017. The extended period of winter storms we experienced in 2023 certainly delayed the start of fire season, but this also led to an abundance of growth and fuel once conditions dried out. While we are really pleased with the headline data, variances and weather conditions from year-to-year can create some comparability challenges. To account for this, we track a weather-normalized ignition rate. We expressed this as ignitions per 100,000 circuit mile days under R3 or higher conditions, as measured by our Fire Potential Index. We've seen the ignition rate decline by 70% overall since 2017, including significant step-downs in 2021 and 2022, validating our layers of protection approach. This year, through mid-October, I am pleased to report that we've seen our weather-normalized ignition rate come down by a further 7% versus 2022. One point I want to reinforce, at PG&E, we're ready every day for dangerous conditions. Our layers of protection do not rely on weather being in our favor. We've implemented state-of-the-art situational readiness technology, tools and people -- we treat every day as a high-risk day. This is the mind-set that will protect our customers and our communities. No matter the conditions we are ready. A good example is our use of public safety power shutoffs. Last year, we didn't need to activate any PSPS events since we did not experience sufficiently high-risk wind conditions. This year, we've initiated two PSPS events, one in August and one in September, and both were quite localized. Through our enhanced situational awareness, which breaks the system down into 2-kilometer polygons, along with our extensive use of data and advanced meteorology, we are continuing to refine our PSPS capabilities. Our program is now far more surgical than when we first rolled it out in 2018. Because of those improvements, our PSPS events only affected around 3,900 customers in August and 1,200 in September. Our post-event analysis shows that our 2023 shutoffs prevented two likely ignitions and close to 30,000 acres, which might have otherwise burned. We are standing for our hometown and are resolved the catastrophic wildfires shall stop. PSPS and EPSS our enhanced Powerline safety settings program have been very effective at reducing ignitions. But both present unacceptable reliability challenges for customers. That's why we see undergrounding as the right long-term infrastructure for the very specific high-risk miles identified in our 10,000-mile plan and affordable for customers at $3.40 per month for the average noncare residential customers. In fact, based on our analysis over the expected life of the assets to be installed during the GRC period, our proposal returns billions of dollars more in net present value compared to the APD. Just like our layers of physical protection, our financial plan also includes multiple layers of protection as illustrated on Slide seven. The orange wedge represents the difference between the APD rate base and our guidance midpoint. Most critically, our layers of protection include improving on the cash elements of the rate case PDs, which we are working hard to do in our advocacy. There are also three items where the PDs do not recommend this allowances, but instead shift cost recovery into other future proceedings. These include future Whimsy [Ph] or equivalent filings incremental spending on energization as provided under SB 410 and our 10-year undergrounding plan under SB 884. We also see no shortage of incremental investment headroom in our FERC jurisdiction rate base. Keep in mind that capital investment for the benefit of customers' needs can be offset with O&M reductions and efficient financing, along with low growth to make sure safe infrastructure is also affordable. This is the heart of our simple, affordable model. Our regulators and key stakeholders are just becoming familiar with this model. And we must implement it in a very trustworthy way so that California can have the modern infrastructure in place that keeps people safe and energized, which takes me to my story of the month on Slide eight. A couple of weeks ago, I visited a site in Vacaville, where my co-workers are burying lines in a high-fire threat area. The project manager and field engineer were on site and could not have been more excited about what they were accomplishing for their home talent. This undergrounding project was originally estimated to cost close to $3.5 million a mile with a completion date in 2024. The team is now estimating a unit cost of approximately $2.9 million a mile and finishing in early December. Using Lean and the principles of waste elimination, my co-workers found opportunities to reduce materials and labor costs by challenging the status quo. They reduce trench depth and width while staying in compliance with county standards and they found additional cost savings during the backfill process. The combination of these solutions brought down the unit cost and they reduced total active construction time, making it safer, faster and reducing the impact on the community. As you can imagine, each project comes with its unique challenges, and this one was no different. What is different now at PG&E is the standard set of tools and the mind-set that my co-workers bring to every job. It's consistent application of lean and problem solving that drives predictable and in some cases, extraordinary breakthrough results no matter what challenges we face. Sticking with undergrounding, I should note that we currently have more than 2,000 qualified personnel working safely on undergrounding in our service territory every day. Earlier this month, we announced that we had finished 100% of the heavy construction work necessary to complete the 350 miles targeted for this year. We expect to energize an average of 20 additional miles per week through the end of the year, and I could not be prouder of the team for overcoming the significant challenges presented by the weather we experienced earlier this year. Day by day, week by week, we are managing our progress, leveraging visual management and operating reviews, giving me the confidence to affirm that we are right on track with our plan for 2023 and with line of sight running well into 2024. And with that, let me hand you over to Carolyn for our financial highlights. Thank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, I just wanted to take a moment to review our regulatory and legislative time line shown here on Slide 14 and reflect on some of our highlights in 2023, starting with our wildfire self-insurance settlement in January which we see saving customers up to $1.8 billion through this 4-year GRC period. Other milestones include resolving our safety culture OII. Settlements with the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division for both the Zogg and the Dixie fires and over $1 billion of interim rate relief approved in our 2022 Wenzy [Ph] proceeding. We have plenty to look forward to as well. Key catalysts we can point to include resolving our GRC and achieving base revenue visibility through 2026, approval of our 2023 WMP and safety certificate, resolution of our GRC Phase 2 proposal to implement SB 410. Our 10-year undergrounding plan filing under SB 884, disposition of our cost of capital adjustment advice letter. The proposed decision on Pacific Generation and advancing our DOE loan application. That's a lot of value to come for customers as well as investors. In addition to regulatory catalysts, we look forward to further progress towards normalizing our financial profile. With the Fire Victim trust completing their sales, restoring our credit ratings to investment grade to unlock significant financing cost savings for customers and reinstating our common dividend. We believe these catalysts favorably differentiate the PG&E investment story anchored in our simple affordable model. Our strategy remains focused and is based on the foundational belief that a financially healthy and well-run PG&E can and will play a leading role in enabling the clean, affordable and resilient energy future to which the state of California and our customers aspire. We trust that you feel the momentum that we do. And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Good morning, Shar. Yes. Thanks, Shar, for the question. These are all things, obviously, on our mind. Look, first of all, the process isn't finished. We're in the throes of completing the final decision for our rate case. We know how important it is. We also know the important work that we want to do for customers. And that is at the heart of what we requested in the rate case and the heart of our advocacy. In terms of difficult choices, I think what we look at, we see without the necessary cash flow, it definitely slows down our ability to complete the work, but we also know that we're committed to improving the health of our balance sheet. I'll address your equity point, but then I want to make a broader point about the regulatory environment here in California. First, on the equity point, we're still committed for sure, to our commitment to not issue equity through 2024. We stand by that plan. We know that issuing equity at this valuation is not good for customers. We need to make sure that we have the equity and access to the capital markets that attracts capital to California, so we can make those necessary investments. So we're standing by our plan there through 2024. But back to the construct and to your question about how do we make these choices. Look, the California regulatory construct is good. It has a lot to love and I've learned that as I've been here it provides many earnings mechanisms and provide certainty in those earnings mechanisms. Let me give you one example. We had these major storms back at the beginning of the year, like 14 storms in the first quarter. And we were able to recognize the revenue associated with covering the cost of those storms through our CEMA mechanism. But we don't collect the cash. There's a delay in that. And so that's the part that I think people are coming to terms with. Here in California, specifically about PG&E is that given our we're on a path to become healthy. We're on a path to recover our balance sheet. We're committed to FFO to debt in the mid-teens. In order to do that, we have to have timely cash recovery. And that's the point we've been trying to make about these proposed decisions that they allow too much cash flow lag and we don't have a balance sheet that can afford that. I think a typical investment-grade utility can handle that buffer. And so the regulatory construct works. But given that we are in the situation we are with our credit metrics, we've got to improve those credit metrics and this is essential to returning us to the position so that. And this is the part that's most important, Shar, so that we can do that necessary work on time. We don't want to have to slow down the deployment of the work. We don't want to have to make choices for customers about which essential work we do first. We want to be able to do that work in parallel. I have the work team -- I have the team here at PG&E who's ready to go, who can do that work for customers that can make the system safer, faster, but we need the cash flow. And so I think it's a new issue here in California. It's a new issue for our regulators to deal with the fact that our credit ratings are where they are. But we do see a path that if we all work together. And if PG&E proves itself trustworthy as we work to do every day, and I think the progress we've made to date is starting to provide that evidence that we can do what we said we're going to do. That we have earned the right to be trusted to deploy this cash to the best benefit of customers, and that's really what we're focused on doing Shar. Yes. Good question, Shar. Thank you. I would say, first of all, these new mechanisms, particularly those that are reflected in the new legislation, SB 410 and last year's legislation around undergrounding do provide for us to do the work. But again, it all comes back to our access to cash and the cash flow. And so we think that we definitely can catch up on the work and do the work if we have the cash. And so that's an important role that these PDs play as we move forward. I will also say that on the undergrounding specifically, it's a relatively small cost in the overall rate case. So in terms of customer cost, as we've calculated and have been sharing $3.40 a month is the impact to customers at the peak of the rate case for customers to do the undergrounding. And the customers I talked to are pretty excited about us doing that work. And so we continue to make the case that undergrounding in very specific miles. And I think it seems to some in some cases, it feels like people are trying to do an all or nothing. It's either we do undergrounding or we do covered conductor. The reality is we have 1,000 miles of covered conductor, there are places on our system where covered conductor is the right choice. What we're talking about is a very specific highest-risk miles with a very unique geography, particularly suspect for vegetation strike. And that vegetation management expense that we are doing every year customers have to pay for. And I think people don't understand it actually is less expensive to do the undergrounding. And people understand it costs something $3.40 a month, but it will cost more to continue to do vegetation management and overhead hardening and the maintenance of those overhead lines in these specific areas. So we continue to make the case. Look, Shar, we see a path forward to do all of the necessary work that our customers have been begging us to do. We're excited about being able to do that work, and we're sure that we can get to a good constructive outcome with our regulators. Thanks, Shar. Yes, you bet. Yes, it's a great question, Steve. And I also think it's something that's been hard to understand in all of the public comments and advocacy. Look, there's some catch-up that needs to be done here. And in California, we have this construct where we need to do necessary work and the utility bears the risk of doing all the wildfire preventive work. And so there are some onetime short-term costs that are embedded in the early years of this rate proceeding. But as the years progress, then those things come out of the bill. So for example, as we do the recovery of the 2023 revenues that obviously needs to be captured then. And our proposal is a 12-month capture in 2024. So if you can imagine a customer would be collecting bills in 2024, that we are paying bills in 2024 that reflect 2024 and 2023s revenue. And then that comes off. And then the bills come down significantly. And so what we're -- the point we're trying to make is that there is some catch-up in this, but bills can definitely improve, that's just math. But what I think is really important and the part that people don't necessarily yet appreciate about the new PG&E model is our simple affordable model. This is not just a slogan, it's not just a thing we say, this is something that we do every day. And that is funding capital investment through cost savings, cost reduction we have had dramatic cost improvements already on our undergrounding, on our vegetation management. Our next big hurdle is our system inspections. We've got major improvements that we can make there. Then we add in the efficient financing. Look, getting our credit ratings in the right place will save customers money, not spreading out the collection of the 2023 revenues over 3 and 4 years will save customers money. We have the ability to reduce costs in the bills, and that's what we're focused on every day. I think that's a new habit, a new pattern for PG&E to be recognized for. And so I can appreciate that regulators and others have questions and wonder if that's actually what we're going to do. All I can say, Steve, I think you know my track record, we can do real cost savings that benefit customers while we're making these very necessary investments in the infrastructure. Well we're hopeful, Steve, that November 2 reflects a final decision. But what's on our mind is we want to make sure that it's the right final decision. And so -- if -- I think there's still two meetings, November 16 and November 30. If in fact, they wanted to take more time to get it right. But we're hopeful that November 2 represents a final decision. Thanks, Steve. And this is Patti. I'll just add in. So no, it hasn't been done before, Nicolas. And so we're working through what that process will be. And so that's not perfectly clear, but I do want to remind everyone that the benefits of AB 1054, there's -- it's a fundamental change in California that really helps create the certainty required to number one, prevent a liquidity issue in the event of a significant incident. It allows us if, in fact, we had did have to, in a hurry, get access to that fund, we could access it to pay third-party damages. But as Carolyn said, it's actually -- it takes time to settle and to pay out those settlements, but the enhanced prudency standard that comes with AB 1054 is another enhancement that will be good to see as we move forward here. And so I think there's a lot to appreciate about AB 1054 and the protections it provides and the certainty it allows for here in California as we do this necessary safety work to make the system safer faster. Yes. Well, first and foremost, let me be clear, we won't do work that the commission didn't fund. And so our plan right now is the most efficient plan we agree. We have done negotiations with contractors. We've developed a workforce. As I mentioned in the script, I've got 2,000 people right now today, doing undergrounding and those people are skilled and qualified -- boy, I don't want to tell them that they have to step off the job. But the reality is we've got 350 miles planned for this year, and we've got engineering in the hopper to prepare us for next year's 450-mile target. And then we're focused on 550 miles in 2025 and 750 miles in 2026, but all of this is contingent upon regulator approval. So if the CPUC decides we should do less undergrounding or to slow down the path, it will cost more for customers, but obviously, we'll take their direction, and we'll then file our 10-year plan and make sure that it does its best job of compelling a more favorable decision to get the scale because that's the beauty of what we've observed already, just like the story of the month that I shared on the call, we are finding savings on every job. And scale is essential to realizing those savings for customers. So that's really what's on our mind as we move forward. We will be filing that 10-year plan when the OEIS is prepared to receive it. Yes, exactly. We certainly don't want to come to a cold hard stop. Like we want to be able to keep moving and keep the acceleration of the benefits for customers rolling every mile buried as another mile of risk virtually eliminated. And so we're really focused on these very specific miles and getting these specific miles done as soon as possible to protect the people of California, and we think we can do that at a very affordable price. Yes. We're very grateful for the legislature and the great work that they did this year in recognizing that when you do a 4-year forward-looking rate making, you don't -- you can't perfectly predict the demand that we're actually experiencing. And so as demand increases, SB 410 allows for an annual true-up of recoveries for the work that needs to be done to enable electric vehicle transition to electrification in the state. And I'm very proud of my team. We've been working hard to improve our own process while we get the necessary funding. What's important is that we are able to do our work more timely. And so here's some news from this year we delivered a 17% increase in volume of requests this year. So in 2022, we did 7,900 new business connections. We're up to 9,200 here in 2023. So that's a 17% increase. Really proud of the team, things all of our lean operating system being put to work, have deployed things like we are estimating, which is our engineering and work preparation is a critical part, but can be a bottleneck in the process. That team has gone to work reimagining how they do estimating, and they've reduced their cycle time from 116 days down to 71 days. I mean that's a 50% improvement in really a 1-year focused effort. So the ability for us to improve throughput and meet the needs of customers is real. We're starting to prove to people that we can, again, do what we said we're going to do and the cash flow that's enabled by SB 410 is helpful because it's more timely, but there is still a year's lag. And so again, we've got to get these credit ratings back up into investment grade so that we can attract the debt markets at the lowest cost for customers. And this whole -- the plan hangs together extremely well when we are -- when we have a balance sheet to fund all this really important work that we need to do for customers. Thanks, Julien. And I'll add. This is Patti. The PacGen the whole purpose of that is for efficient financing for customers. And so this is a good example of how we're not just counting on others. We're not just counting on the regulators to fix our balance sheet. There are things self-action that we can take that we are taking that is really intended to help enable customers to get the value that they're demanding, the value they deserve in this infrastructure that we have the privilege to build for them. And so this is just another example of our simple affordable model, efficient financing as a piece of the puzzle to make sure that we can invest in the infrastructure and save customers money. And so that's what we're up to on this transaction. Thanks, Gregg. Yes. Our plan is dynamic enough that in 2025 and 2026, we can adjust the miles and make sure that they're mutually agreeable, if you will. I will say that as we designed the sequencing of the miles, we picked -- well -- and let me just start with every mile in the 10,000 miles is high risk. So if you do mile 8,000 or mile 2000, you're still tackling a high-risk mile. So we'll start with that. But as we sequence those 10,000 miles, we did include the adjacent miles that also will be underground for an efficiency. That's how we get to the lower unit cost. But if there's certain miles that the regulators instruct us to do sooner as we work with OEIS on our risk reduction plan will definitely be prioritized. We definitely are focused on making sure that the system is safe today because of our mechanisms like EPSS and public safety power shutoffs but those cause outages. The public safety power shutoffs and the EPSS mechanisms are working. We showed that with our ignition reduction. And so we know customers are safe today, but we want them to be resilient. We don't want customers to have to choose between having safety or having power. We want them to have both and undergrounding as the lowest cost path to that future. Yes. So we have demands every day on capacity increases, EV charging infrastructure. And so that's just -- and that demands some of that we can't -- we don't know the project request yet because it will come in a very -- it happens all the time. And so that's the point about SB 410. We can't perfectly predict what those 300 projects would be. Otherwise, we wouldn't need the mechanism. Because it comes in as EV penetration increases to meet the state's direction as EV charging infrastructure gets built out. That will vary year after year. And so that's the beauty of SB 410, whatever the demand is, we can meet it. And we won't recover more than we install, we'll just have good timely true-up of that work that gets demanded by customers. And so that's more of a calculated 300 than actual specific 300 projects. . Thanks, Ryan. We sure can. Good morning. Yes. Well, we'll be working that. First and foremost, we think a revision to the PD will be good and enable us to do more faster, so number one. Number two, though, as we look at the SB 410, that's going to be driven by customer demand, and that's good work to be done. Our whimsy proceedings, we'll continue to file those on a timely basis. Those certainly help with cash flow. It's a good example of a delayed recovery that doesn't affect earnings, but it certainly affects our credit metrics and our balance sheet. And so WIMS [Ph] will be important to be resolved in a timely manner. But the 10-year undergrounding plan just provides the pathway to the lowest cost safest infrastructure. And then certainly, FERC transmission, as you saw, we filed our TO filing earlier in October. We'll continue to leverage the ability to do that at those transmission projects as well as key components of the whole picture. One of the things that is really important to understand is I rattle off all those things, there is so much work to be done here. Work that customers deserve work that customers will greatly value and benefit from work that customers have been asking us to do for some time. And so what's important to recognize is we always self-regulate the volume of work we do on customers' ability to afford. That is the simple affordable model. That we can invest in this capital infrastructure as indicated in -- on Slide 7, but we offset it with cost savings for customers every single day. And so those cost savings is what makes it possible to grow rate base like that without putting an undue burden on customers and their ability to pay. So it's value for customers and cost savings that make up that simple, affordable model, good for customers, good for investors. No, it's good bread and butter transmission investment, stuff that helps enable the clean energy transition that's happening here in California and work that improves both reliability and access to that clean energy. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We definitely enjoy this time together, but we appreciate certainly your patience on this GRC. It has a long-term impact. And it is worth the way to get it right and to make sure that we are aligned with our regulators. We all want the same thing. We want the safest system as fast as possible that customers can afford. And so we're working together to get to a good outcome and we appreciate your patience. We will hold a special call once we have a final decision to review the details and share more of our insights when we get to a final resolution. We look forward to seeing you at EEI and please be safe out there."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PG&E Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Arnold Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's second quarter earnings call presentation. Presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30 2023. With that it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO Patti Poppe.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Jonathan. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on what we know is a very busy earnings morning. We continue to make progress here at PG&E and this quarter is no different. Our core earnings per share of $0.23 for the second quarter bring us to $0.52 for the first half of 2023. While our first half earnings are down $0.03 versus 2022 we have not yet recognized the benefit of our general rate case. As a reminder we have a memo account in place which will allow us to book catch-up revenues from the January 1 2023 effective date once we receive a final CPUC decision. We still expect a final decision in the third quarter and we were encouraged that the CPUC affirmed this timing earlier this month. As we shared at our Investor Day in May 86% of our incremental revenue request is for core safety reliability and maintenance work. All areas where there is strong alignment with state policy goals and stakeholder priorities. While the GRC decision will be an important driver halfway through the year we remain on track to plan and laser-focused on delivering our annual guidance which we are reaffirming today. We are also reaffirming earnings growth rates of at least 10% in 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026 along with our commitment to no new equity issuance through 2024. Turning to Slide 4. We've continued to make progress in mitigating physical and financial risk. On the physical front we continue to focus on system resilience by reducing wildfire risk and preparing for the grid of the future. We continue to make progress on the regulatory front as well. For example, in the second quarter the CPUC approved over $1 billion of interim rate relief in our 2022 Wednesday proceeding. This accelerates the time line for recovering our legacy wildfire mitigation spend improves our financial metrics and allows us to deliver on needed safety reliability and customer connections work benefiting both our customers and our investors. On the legal front, at the end of May, we were pleased to settle with the Shasta County District Attorney's Office resolving the criminal charges related to the 2020 Zogg Fire. The settlement includes commitments by PG&E to contribute $45 million to various local organizations as part of our ongoing efforts to make it right and make it safe. Our settlement followed rulings by the Superior Court which upheld our long-standing position that there was no evidence showing PG&E's inspections fell below the required standard of care, nor was there any evidence that the risk related to the tree was visible prior to the fire. The court's ruling from April is available on our Investor Relations website. Turning to financial risk mitigation. Our strategy continues to hinge around the simple affordable model, which delivers consistently improving value for customers and investors. Regarding the Fire Victim Trust, we are encouraged that the trust has now monetized over 85% of its initial holding and at steadily higher values for its beneficiaries. After the 60 million share sale earlier this month, the trust now holds just over 3% of our stock. As of the end of June, determination notices have been issued for 97% of all claims with the trustee having indicated a goal to reach 100% and monetize the remaining shares by year-end. Turning to slide five. We highlight our layers of protection strategy along with our anticipated step-up in risk reduction from 90% to 94%, as we roll out our new and expanded programs under our 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. One example is downed conductor detection technology, which involves installing new hardware in the field, supplementing our enhanced power line safety settings. We filed our WMP with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety in late March and the OEIS came out with its revision notice towards the end of June. We view this feedback as a constructive part of the WMP process and we embrace the opportunity to drive further alignment with our regulators. OEIS identified eight critical issues and we will file our response by August 7 deadline with the draft decision from OEIS expected at the end of September. The revision notice process will not preclude us from filing our annual safety certificate application by the due date of September 13 with OEIS approval due 90 days later. As a reminder, our existing safety certificate remains in effect pending an OEIS decision on our timely filed new application. Earlier this month, at the Annual Board level safety briefing with the CPUC, our Utility Board Chair, Cheryl Campbell; and our Chief Operating Officer, Sumeet Singh discussed our safety culture, performance and details of our enterprise safety management system. These meetings are an element of our AB 1054 compliance and provide an opportunity to engage with regulators on our improvement strategies. We were encouraged to hear commissioners recognize our significant progress, while acknowledging our challenges including changing climate conditions. It's in moments like this that we step back and reflect on the progress being made. In fact at a recent meeting with all of our top leaders, Mark Quinlan, our SVP of Wildfire and Emergency Operations stood up to address the elephant in the room when he said, I bet you're all watching the weather and thinking back to 2017. Well, let me remind you just how much we've done since then. He went on to remind us all that we have an entirely different readiness posture and physical risk mitigation regime in place. Back in 2017, we were reacting and responding to hazards. The investments we've made since then have enabled a dramatic shift to predicting and preventing. Slide 6 illustrates the mitigations now in place thanks to these important investments in innovation. To name just a few. Since 2017, we have installed over 600 high-definition cameras now with AI capabilities more than 1,400 weather stations and almost 1,400 sectionalizing devices. We've hardened over 1,300 miles of line and undergrounded over 300 more. We've removed 3.3 million trees. We've staffed a hazard awareness warning center 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year and we've hired 130 fire prevention professionals who are on our PG&E team and making us safer every day. We've implemented a host of operational mitigations including enhanced power line safety settings on 44000 miles of line in and adjacent to our high fire risk areas. We've enabled public safety power shutoffs when conditions warrant them and new for 2023 we've deployed partial voltage force out and down conductor detection. Our system has never been safer and yet it will be even safer still tomorrow and every day after that. As we shared with the CPUC during the safety briefing we are making progress and we have more work to do. Safety permeates through everything we do and the presence of controls, including our layers of protection leads to manageable and predictable outcomes. I'm confident that we and our key partners including the state are doing everything we can to cause our stance catastrophic wildfires shall stop. The data tell the story. Through mid-July reportable ignitions in our high fire threat district have decreased 53% from the equivalent date in 2017. Last year, we saw a 68% reduction in ignitions on EPSS-enabled circuits and a 99% reduction in acres burned. The data so far suggests we are on track to see further improvement in 2023. Our hard work over the past five years has dramatically changed our risk exposure and the fundamental safety of our system and we aren't stopping there. Moving to slide 7. We also see profound changes in financial risk mitigation due to the framework put in place by SB 901 and AB 1054. At our Investor Day, you heard Ann Patterson Governor Newsom's Cabinet Secretary talk about how the state Wildfire Fund is working as planned. The AB 1054 construct is designed to give utilities and capital providers the financial assurance they need while deploying the investments required to bring down wildfire risk on the system over time. Let me quickly revisit the key features for those looking for a refresher or who may be newer to our story. For wildfire claims exceeding $1 billion in a calendar year, we have access to the state wildfire fund. This provides $21 billion of claim-paying capacity protecting investors from the risk of a liquidity event. Our annual wildfire mitigation plan is a requirement for receiving our annual safety certificate. So long as we have a valid safety certificate we have access to two additional key features of AB 1054. First, the utility's conduct is presumed to have been prudent upfront when it comes to seeking cost recovery at the CPUC along with the prudency standard modeled on the constructive FERC precedent. Second in the unlikely event of the utility being found to have acted imprudently any resulting obligation to reimburse the wildfire fund would be capped at 20% of electric T&D equity rate base on a three-year rolling basis. This cap is currently around $3 billion for PG&E. This is a much better construct than what was in place prior to SB 901 and AB 1054 and that enables the attraction of the necessary capital to build and operate a safe and climate resilient energy system. Turning to Slide 8. Let's review our regulatory and legislative time line. We've made progress on multiple fronts in the first half of the year including, approval of our wildfire self-insurance settlement, the Zogg Fire litigation settlement and 2022 WMCE Interim Rate release. Looking forward, we have several catalysts on the horizon, starting with a GRC final decision expected in the current quarter; the ongoing legislative session in Sacramento where we have seen constructive engagement on energization, which you've heard us previously refer to as new customer connections, showing the legislature's commitment to California's clean energy transition and then on our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan and safety certification processes. Looking a little further out, at the end of this year, we will file our nuclear operating license extension application for Diablo Canyon with NRC and we remain ready to submit our 10-year undergrounding plan once the OEIS and the CPUC complete their scoping process. On Slide 9, you have our 2023 report card where we're showing on track for each of our 2023 and long-term targets. This includes our plan to underground 350 miles in 2023, double last year's target and our 2024 FFO to debt target of mid-teens. As you can see, we're also projecting on track for our 2% non-fuel O&M reduction target, which brings me to my story of the month. This month's story illustrates how our regional service model together with our performance playbook and lean operating system is helping improve the customer experience while we eliminate waste and cost in our work processes. In the North Coast region field operations teams are improving upon a common sense approach that has worked in a lot of our programs bundling work. What's different now is that the teams are working across various branches of electric gas systems inspections and vegetation management to coordinate many types of work, not just bundling similar work in siloed programs as we've done in the past. Cross-functional work bundling allows crews to do more work under the same planned outage line clearance, reducing the cost of switching and grid operations and improving overall reliability. During Q2, my coworkers planned and executed 12 jobs under just one planned outage near the town of Willits. Rather than impacting 100-plus customers multiple times over the year, we did it all in just one go. That's one outage, one day of traffic lane closures, one batch of notifications and only one visit. This goes to show you what's possible when we put the customer at the center of our operations. So far this year, we estimate savings of $0.5 million and 800-plus hours when we did not have to deenergize our customers. This is just the tip of the iceberg and something we are working actively to scale up across all regions, proving we can deliver an improved customer experience while cutting costs all at the same time. This is all part of the momentum we're building here at PG&E. And with that, I'll turn it over to Carolyn.\nCarolyn Burke: Thank you, Patti, and good morning everybody. As Patti mentioned, we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitments. Today, we are reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2023 and 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're also reaffirming our commitment to no new equity in 2023 or 2024. This morning, I'll cover three main topics with you: our 2023 results, the simple affordable model and our value proposition. Let's start on Slide 10. We are on track to meet our 2023 EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. Our first half results and drivers of our forecast for the second half of 2023 are presented here. On a year-to-date basis our result is $0.52 per share, including $0.23 in the second quarter. Our first half EPS is on plan. And as Patti mentioned our plan to reduce non-fuel O&M by 2% is also on track. So far this year we've realized $0.04 of favorability from our cost-saving efforts and we've redeployed $0.02 right back into the business. Although our year-to-date result is down $0.03 compared to 2022, a key driver for the second half of 2023 will be a final decision in our GRC. As a reminder the CPUC has approved a standard memo account, which allows us to record catch-up revenues back to January 1st once the final decision is received. This explains the $0.01 of timing as shown here and also why you don't see customer capital investment as a growth driver in our first half results. Finally, we're showing $0.04 of other. This is a combination of many smaller items over the first and second quarters including higher property taxes reflecting our increased customer capital investment. On Slide 11 our capital investment plans have not changed from Investor Day when we provided insight into our 10-year plan. Our 9.5% rate based CAGR reflects the abundant opportunities to invest capital into our system for the benefit of customers. Please recall this is a no big bets approach focused on safety and reliability with growth benefiting both our customers and our investors. Just as our earnings grow with capital growth it's worth repeating that this capital investment growth above depreciation also provides additional cash flow to help internally fund the investment. Moving to slide 12. We continue to see ample opportunities to expand customer investment beyond the $52 billion planned through 2027. We are fortunate to have substantial needs for investment in our electric distribution and transmission systems as well as opportunities to further improve quality and reduce cost. Our simple affordable model is at the heart of our plan. It is how we plan to keep bills affordable for our customers, which takes us to Slide 13. As you've seen we revisit this slide with you each quarter providing proof points on our execution. Patti already provided an update on our O&M cost reduction progress. And now I'm excited to share some recent efficient financing developments. Our minority sale of non-nuclear generating assets or Pacific Gen continues to move through the regulatory process. We launched the marketing for the proposed sale last month. We expect these attractive and differentiated assets to draw strong investor interest as they are fully regulated with a favorable ratemaking framework. And with California's environmental policies in place, we see a very supportive backdrop for growth opportunities. As a reminder the Pac Gen regulatory and sales processes will progress unparallel time lines. Additionally last month we submitted a loan application to the Department of Energy under the Energy Infrastructure reinvestment program. Our application is all about enabling California's clean energy transition. If our application is approved, we would expect to draw down these funds starting in 2024 and through 2026 to align with spending in our GRC cycle. This is another example of how we're pursuing efficient financing to deliver for our customers and our communities at a lower cost. In addition to providing a diversified funding source for our large capital program, lower cost DOE loans could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in interest expense savings for our customers over the life of the loans. This means that our planned rate base growth could come at a lower cost for our customers creating more capacity for investment in customer benefiting infrastructure, definitely a win-win. We plan to submit part two of our application in the coming months in which we will work with the loan program office on the technical and financial evaluation of our application. I'll end here on slide 14 with a reiteration of dividend timing. Specifically, we expect to reach a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11 during the third quarter. As we have said before, this timing remains subject to assumptions including the timing of major regulatory decisions. In practice, this means that our Board could have the opportunity to declare a dividend as soon as our third quarter earnings call. We are committed to restoring a dividend and recognize its importance to traditional utility investors. But let me be clear, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start out with a small dividend likely lower than some published estimates. This will allow us to continue prioritizing needed capital investment including safety and physical risk reduction on behalf of our customers. While we would expect to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings per share, our initial bias will be towards premium EPS growth versus higher yield consistent with our capital investment priority. Our physical and financial risks are being mitigated. Our capital investment need and growth forecast benefits customers and investors. Our EPS growth is among the very best as our stock price recovers from a deep discount. And our value proposition is strong and improving every quarter. And with that I'll hand it back to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, I wanted to take a quick moment to highlight two other pieces of news from PG&E this week. Yesterday, we issued our annual corporate sustainability report which outlines major strides we've made towards the triple bottom-line of serving people the planet and California's prosperity. Using statistics and stories the report details meaningful action we took last year in service of our home towns throughout Northern and Central California. Second as highlighted here on slide 15 we hosted our inaugural Innovation Summit earlier this week drawing over 2,000 in-person and virtual participants from venture capital, technolog, academic and financial world. Risk mitigation in particular wildfire has rightly been Job one and our main priority. At the same time, our California service area is at the very forefront of the energy transition given our state's bold vision for the future. With this in mind, we created our innovation research and development team to capitalize on breakthrough opportunities drawing on the external innovation ecosystem to inspire bold new ideas for safety and our operations. For example, during the Innovation Summit, we featured a first-of-its-kind version of Schneider's electric distribution energy management system operating on the Microsoft Cloud. On the topic of innovation, I'm also pleased to announce that the XPrize competition featured at our Investor Day has already received interest from 120 individual teams out of 32 different countries. Talk about breakthrough opportunities. The objective of this competition is to be able to pinpoint ignitions from space within 60 seconds or less and autonomously suppress wildfires within 10 minutes. I'm excited to see what these brilliant minds produce. I'll wrap up on Slide 16, by saying we feel good about the progress we are making, mitigating physical and financial risk. We're confident in the protections we have in place for this wildfire season. And we see several catalysts ahead for investors including restoration of our common stock dividend and a final decision in our 2023 GRC. We see the progress and feel the momentum. We hope you do too. With that operator, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. Patti I just wanted to start off with a question on the GRC timing. It seems there's obviously some filing still happening. They're coming through and the PD still isn't issued as you kind of highlighted there. I guess, what's your level of confidence here in getting a PD and what is a potential delay in the PD due as we're thinking about disclosures and when you recognize earnings and update guidance including obviously, enactment of official dividend policy? Thanks.\nPatti Poppe: Okay, Shar. Thank you for that's a very robust question. I'm going to get right at it. First let me remind you that our GRC is 85% safety, reliability, resilience work. Our customers are demanding this work of us and our stakeholders are really supportive of us doing this work. So I think that bodes very well for our GRC and its outcome. It's important that we remain aligned with our regulators to deliver on a very important regulatory outcome that is so important and so good for customers. So I'll just start with that. But just \u2013 I'll just back up and remind you about the timing. So the CPUC voted to extend the GRC deadline from June 30 to December 30. They needed that calendar so that the final decision could be issued still in Q3, which they have been pretty clear that it was going to be issued in Q3. So while the CPUC hasn't issued their proposed decision, the July 13 order included language that reinforced the timing. The commission, in fact the quote is that the commission still anticipates consideration of this matter on a commission agenda in the third quarter of 2023. We were very grateful for that reiteration of the importance of the timing. I think it's been really clear. We've been working closely with our stakeholders here in the state, how important it is that we get a timely GRC sold that. We can do this very important necessary work for our customers. So all that to say, obviously, we plan conservatively on the expected outcomes and we've got a plan that we think is defendable and is going to be welcomed by the commission but we're also putting in our contingency planning to make sure we're ready. Now I'll just close out with your final question about the implications for the dividend. I think Carolyn was very clear in our prepared remarks about the importance of the dividend, why we know that it's important to establish a dividend. But what's most important is that we're doing the right work for customers and we've got the GRC is obviously, the most important that we have a good GRC outcome. Now we're in the final stages of that GRC process. We've said that the dividend is dependent on regulatory timing, and I don't want to get ahead of ourselves at all here. We're going to watch how that plays out, and then we'll give an update and let you know the status on the third quarter call.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. Fantastic. And then just lastly for me, Patti. Just maybe briefly touching on sort of your expectations for safety certification and the WMP approvals. I mean OEIS and the stakeholders still kind of scrutinize the details of the plan. Are there concerns, that caused you to engage remediating action? Or is that already in plan? And how is the time line shifting as the WMP moves towards PD and you plan to file the 23 certification in September. Thanks.\nA \u2013 Patti Poppe: Yes. Well, one of the things I'm really going to appreciate is this WMP process. It's an open and transparent proceeding. It allows us to align, with our regulator and frankly to get the best ideas on the table. We welcome that alignment and we welcome the feedback, because that will make us better. And anything we can do to make the system safer, faster is important to us. Now in the revision notice that the OEIS issued, it identified eight critical issues and we have until August 7, we'll be filing our revision -- our response to that revision notice. It had some -- about three main themes, I would suggest in their feedback. They're asking for additional granularity like, for example, quarterly data through 2024 on vegetation management targets. That's a reasonable request, and we can provide that feedback. Additional information on proposals and alternatives considered like, for example, the changing in our underground mile timing when we might make those revisions, and more insights to understand our objectives in both the three-year filing, but also the 10-year look, which all of that is -- they're good questions and we can have good healthy dialogue, with the safety regulators here in the state to make sure that we've got alignment there. So we'll submit that revision on August 7, and we expect a draft decision from OEIS at the end of September. Now the safety certificate filing date is set as prior to September 13, 2023. So, we'll make that filing even if we don't have a final decision on the WMP, and then the OEIS has 90 days to review our safety certificate application.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. Big congrats, Patti on the execution. It's pretty -- it's very noticeable. Thanks so much.\nA \u2013 Patti Poppe: Thank you. Shar\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nQ \u2013 David Arcaro: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.\nA \u2013 Patti Poppe: Hi, David.\nQ \u2013 David Arcaro: I was just wondering if you could give an update on, how the -- I guess the environmental backdrop is shaping up so far during the summer and into fire season. Just is the expectation still or are the have the conditions changed at all in terms of expectations, when you're looking at fuel out there moisture content, just outlook into the rest of the summer and how this year's kind of fire season is shaping up right now? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Patti Poppe: Yes. So, a couple of things. One, of course all of that moisture that we got in the first quarter of this year certainly has I would say, delayed the start of fire season. We had a good moisture. But as you've indicated, David, it also provides for additional fuel in the form of grasses and grasses to be managed. The important thing to know, and what we're really trying to convey in our report today and really making the distinction about how far we've come since 2017, we are ready no matter what. We are ready, no matter the conditions. Our Hawk 24/7 365 is utilizing all of those cameras and weather stations we know precisely the conditions and our enhanced power line safety settings went into automatic mode on July 1. We deactivate those when conditions warrant. So there are certain cases where we do know we have high moisture and in particular polygon in our service area. And so we deactivate the EPSS but we have EPSS ready and able every single day of the year. And so for us we're just using this as an opportunity to be wildfire ready no matter the conditions. All that being said we're having great performance. Our EPSS settings continue to be an extraordinary risk mitigation tool for us. In fact this year our ignitions year-to-date are 50% less than what they were last year. And last year was an extraordinary year of performance as well. So we're feeling very good about our posture and we're ready.\nDavid Arcaro : That's clear. Thanks for that color. And then separately looking at the $5 billion bucket of potential incremental upside CapEx opportunities you've added a bit more tail around where some of those opportunities could come from. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of if there are any near-term opportunities to pull any of those programs into the CapEx plan or just a little bit of color around the cadence and the timing for when those opportunities start to crystallize?\nCarolyn Burke : Yes, David I'll take that question. So I would say the two areas that we see the most potential in terms of working our model to see that they're going to be affordable is in the transmission area and new customer connections. So we are looking at partnerships. We are looking at additional new customer -- we've made a significant progress in terms of looking at our overall process of bringing those connections online sooner. And so there's -- I would say those are the two areas that you could expect more insight in over the coming earnings calls.\nPatti Poppe: And David all of that is contingent upon affordability for our customers and do we in fact have headroom to go ahead and add additional capital. And so all of our waste elimination work all of our cost savings work some of our big strategic efforts to reduce cost and get more streamlined and then the little itty-bitty ideas that all add up give us an opportunity to then deploy that more -- that capital for the benefit of customers when we can be sure that they can afford it. So that's always the equation that we're running.\nDavid Arcaro : Understood. Makes sense. Thanks so much.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning, Patti and Carolyn. Thanks for the time.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning. Just following up on the last one actually I'll pivot to this direction. The DOE headlines here. Maybe we could talk a little bit about how you think about is that incremental or not? How do you think about that in terms of the projects that you already have underway versus being incremental? Does that displace some other projects? Just kind of think about the financial impacts of pulling down on that DOE money obviously clearly beneficial in any regard for customers?\nCarolyn Burke : Julien, this is Carolyn. Thank you for the question. So it is not incremental. We believe that we're going to use this financing to fund the programs that we have already in place. We have a very well laid out plan. We have more than enough to invest into our system. And so this financing is simply going to allow it to be more efficiently financed.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. Fair enough. I'll leave that there. Maybe just tipping to another subject real quickly here, how do you think just the capital structure, again this is more a financing -- do you no longer need or expect to need the capital structure waivers, you think about kind of a normalization, we talk about dividend today, do you think about capital structure tomorrow, et cetera?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah. I think -- two things just to recall I mean I'll reiterate the no new equity in 2023 and 2024. And we have a commitment to pay down the parent debt of about $2 billion plus by 2026. So in terms of that waiver, we're monitoring that. We're on track. We've made improvements over the last couple of years and we continue to foresee those improvements. And we don't -- if the waiver is in place until we'll be able to make that waiver until June 2025, yeah, I thought it was 2025 sorry. Couldn't it remember it was June or March?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. Okay, excellent. I\u2019ll leave it there. I will see you guys soon. Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Great. Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Your line is open.\nRyan Levine: Hi, good morning everybody.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Levine: Hi. In terms of the dividend, are there any other regulatory items outside of the GRC that could impact the timing of reinstating the dividend with the third quarter call or some footnotes in your prepared comments? I just wanted to clarify what was being intended with that statement.\nPatti Poppe: Yeah. No it's primarily the GRC, Ryan.\nRyan Levine: Okay, great. And then on the heels of the Innovation Summit, curious your latest thinking about how artificial intelligence could impact your business both from a cost, capital or risk standpoint going forward and what work streams do you have to incorporate that?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah. Ryan that innovation summit was just spectacular. We opened the doors to the future with thousands of people participated in that event from all across the globe. We have people signed in from Australia and Israel and UK and all across the country here in the US as well. We have standing room only here in California. It was very fun to see the appetite to support our True North strategy and the key enablers to a pathway to the clean energy transition and a robust gas system. It was really exciting to imagine how all those partnerships might emerge from that date. And I'm glad so many investors signed on for that day as well. But back to your question about AI. First of all, I'll remind you that we've been using artificial intelligence already. And in fact in 2019, we introduced our wildfire spread model. That's the technology [ph] platform that helps us forecast where our highest risks are and what a wildfire spread might look like. We operationalize that artificial intelligence in 2021. And we've been utilizing that routinely. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. We're also using AI for asset health as we do our inspections and then coordinating between drone inspections and data collection. It's very hard for humans to review photos. We take all of these images and humans can make an error, it's a judgment. But an artificial intelligence platform that can review all of those visual images can truly automate our response and then build into our asset health plan what next might fail and be predictive in that way. And so we're pretty excited about the application of AI to continue our system safety efforts and our asset health. But then there are simple things, like just automating simple back office processes and administrative tasks. So we're playing with that. And then things like customer service. And so we're really excited about the applications of artificial intelligence. We know there's, things to be cautious about and we're working to make sure that any platform that we use protects our customers' data and any kind of company secret data. We make sure that that safety exists for our data as well as our physical assets, so, much more to come in AI for PG&E for sure.\nRyan Levine: Great. Looks forward to it, I guess in terms of the DOE loan congratulations on receiving that subsidized capital. Outside of federal dollars, are there any state programs that you're looking to tap into to help mitigate bill impact through different California initiatives?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah. We have several California initiatives. So things like the California Climate Credit. We accelerated that earlier this year so that it was during the heating season to offset some of those gas charges that were so high at the beginning of the year. We have our Income Qualified Customer Assistance Programs. We call that CARE. It's a very robust income-qualified program to help customers, who don't have the ability to always afford their utility bill. We make sure that they're cared for and have the energy that they need. There's a California Arrearage Payment Program, where for example, more than 300,000 customers who were experiencing financial hardships during the pandemic, received an automatic one-time build credit in February of 2023. And then, back to your innovation point, earlier Ryan, the $83 million EPIC program is a source of funding so that we can invest in doing new technologies that make it safer and more affordable for customers in the future. So that's a really exciting part of our portfolio too that benefits customers.\nRyan Levine: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPatti Poppe: You're welcome. Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the CEO Ms. Patti Poppe.\nPatti Poppe: Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. I know you've got a busy calendar. And we're grateful for your time. And we look forward to seeing you soon. Be safe out there.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carolyn Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti, and good morning everybody. As Patti mentioned, we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitments. Today, we are reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2023 and 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're also reaffirming our commitment to no new equity in 2023 or 2024. This morning, I'll cover three main topics with you: our 2023 results, the simple affordable model and our value proposition. Let's start on Slide 10. We are on track to meet our 2023 EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. Our first half results and drivers of our forecast for the second half of 2023 are presented here. On a year-to-date basis our result is $0.52 per share, including $0.23 in the second quarter. Our first half EPS is on plan. And as Patti mentioned our plan to reduce non-fuel O&M by 2% is also on track. So far this year we've realized $0.04 of favorability from our cost-saving efforts and we've redeployed $0.02 right back into the business. Although our year-to-date result is down $0.03 compared to 2022, a key driver for the second half of 2023 will be a final decision in our GRC. As a reminder the CPUC has approved a standard memo account, which allows us to record catch-up revenues back to January 1st once the final decision is received. This explains the $0.01 of timing as shown here and also why you don't see customer capital investment as a growth driver in our first half results. Finally, we're showing $0.04 of other. This is a combination of many smaller items over the first and second quarters including higher property taxes reflecting our increased customer capital investment. On Slide 11 our capital investment plans have not changed from Investor Day when we provided insight into our 10-year plan. Our 9.5% rate based CAGR reflects the abundant opportunities to invest capital into our system for the benefit of customers. Please recall this is a no big bets approach focused on safety and reliability with growth benefiting both our customers and our investors. Just as our earnings grow with capital growth it's worth repeating that this capital investment growth above depreciation also provides additional cash flow to help internally fund the investment. Moving to slide 12. We continue to see ample opportunities to expand customer investment beyond the $52 billion planned through 2027. We are fortunate to have substantial needs for investment in our electric distribution and transmission systems as well as opportunities to further improve quality and reduce cost. Our simple affordable model is at the heart of our plan. It is how we plan to keep bills affordable for our customers, which takes us to Slide 13. As you've seen we revisit this slide with you each quarter providing proof points on our execution. Patti already provided an update on our O&M cost reduction progress. And now I'm excited to share some recent efficient financing developments. Our minority sale of non-nuclear generating assets or Pacific Gen continues to move through the regulatory process. We launched the marketing for the proposed sale last month. We expect these attractive and differentiated assets to draw strong investor interest as they are fully regulated with a favorable ratemaking framework. And with California's environmental policies in place, we see a very supportive backdrop for growth opportunities. As a reminder the Pac Gen regulatory and sales processes will progress unparallel time lines. Additionally last month we submitted a loan application to the Department of Energy under the Energy Infrastructure reinvestment program. Our application is all about enabling California's clean energy transition. If our application is approved, we would expect to draw down these funds starting in 2024 and through 2026 to align with spending in our GRC cycle. This is another example of how we're pursuing efficient financing to deliver for our customers and our communities at a lower cost. In addition to providing a diversified funding source for our large capital program, lower cost DOE loans could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in interest expense savings for our customers over the life of the loans. This means that our planned rate base growth could come at a lower cost for our customers creating more capacity for investment in customer benefiting infrastructure, definitely a win-win. We plan to submit part two of our application in the coming months in which we will work with the loan program office on the technical and financial evaluation of our application. I'll end here on slide 14 with a reiteration of dividend timing. Specifically, we expect to reach a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11 during the third quarter. As we have said before, this timing remains subject to assumptions including the timing of major regulatory decisions. In practice, this means that our Board could have the opportunity to declare a dividend as soon as our third quarter earnings call. We are committed to restoring a dividend and recognize its importance to traditional utility investors. But let me be clear, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start out with a small dividend likely lower than some published estimates. This will allow us to continue prioritizing needed capital investment including safety and physical risk reduction on behalf of our customers. While we would expect to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings per share, our initial bias will be towards premium EPS growth versus higher yield consistent with our capital investment priority. Our physical and financial risks are being mitigated. Our capital investment need and growth forecast benefits customers and investors. Our EPS growth is among the very best as our stock price recovers from a deep discount. And our value proposition is strong and improving every quarter. And with that I'll hand it back to Patti. Yes, David I'll take that question. So I would say the two areas that we see the most potential in terms of working our model to see that they're going to be affordable is in the transmission area and new customer connections. So we are looking at partnerships. We are looking at additional new customer -- we've made a significant progress in terms of looking at our overall process of bringing those connections online sooner. And so there's -- I would say those are the two areas that you could expect more insight in over the coming earnings calls. Julien, this is Carolyn. Thank you for the question. So it is not incremental. We believe that we're going to use this financing to fund the programs that we have already in place. We have a very well laid out plan. We have more than enough to invest into our system. And so this financing is simply going to allow it to be more efficiently financed."

            "name": "Patti Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on what we know is a very busy earnings morning. We continue to make progress here at PG&E and this quarter is no different. Our core earnings per share of $0.23 for the second quarter bring us to $0.52 for the first half of 2023. While our first half earnings are down $0.03 versus 2022 we have not yet recognized the benefit of our general rate case. As a reminder we have a memo account in place which will allow us to book catch-up revenues from the January 1 2023 effective date once we receive a final CPUC decision. We still expect a final decision in the third quarter and we were encouraged that the CPUC affirmed this timing earlier this month. As we shared at our Investor Day in May 86% of our incremental revenue request is for core safety reliability and maintenance work. All areas where there is strong alignment with state policy goals and stakeholder priorities. While the GRC decision will be an important driver halfway through the year we remain on track to plan and laser-focused on delivering our annual guidance which we are reaffirming today. We are also reaffirming earnings growth rates of at least 10% in 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026 along with our commitment to no new equity issuance through 2024. Turning to Slide 4. We've continued to make progress in mitigating physical and financial risk. On the physical front we continue to focus on system resilience by reducing wildfire risk and preparing for the grid of the future. We continue to make progress on the regulatory front as well. For example, in the second quarter the CPUC approved over $1 billion of interim rate relief in our 2022 Wednesday proceeding. This accelerates the time line for recovering our legacy wildfire mitigation spend improves our financial metrics and allows us to deliver on needed safety reliability and customer connections work benefiting both our customers and our investors. On the legal front, at the end of May, we were pleased to settle with the Shasta County District Attorney's Office resolving the criminal charges related to the 2020 Zogg Fire. The settlement includes commitments by PG&E to contribute $45 million to various local organizations as part of our ongoing efforts to make it right and make it safe. Our settlement followed rulings by the Superior Court which upheld our long-standing position that there was no evidence showing PG&E's inspections fell below the required standard of care, nor was there any evidence that the risk related to the tree was visible prior to the fire. The court's ruling from April is available on our Investor Relations website. Turning to financial risk mitigation. Our strategy continues to hinge around the simple affordable model, which delivers consistently improving value for customers and investors. Regarding the Fire Victim Trust, we are encouraged that the trust has now monetized over 85% of its initial holding and at steadily higher values for its beneficiaries. After the 60 million share sale earlier this month, the trust now holds just over 3% of our stock. As of the end of June, determination notices have been issued for 97% of all claims with the trustee having indicated a goal to reach 100% and monetize the remaining shares by year-end. Turning to slide five. We highlight our layers of protection strategy along with our anticipated step-up in risk reduction from 90% to 94%, as we roll out our new and expanded programs under our 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. One example is downed conductor detection technology, which involves installing new hardware in the field, supplementing our enhanced power line safety settings. We filed our WMP with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety in late March and the OEIS came out with its revision notice towards the end of June. We view this feedback as a constructive part of the WMP process and we embrace the opportunity to drive further alignment with our regulators. OEIS identified eight critical issues and we will file our response by August 7 deadline with the draft decision from OEIS expected at the end of September. The revision notice process will not preclude us from filing our annual safety certificate application by the due date of September 13 with OEIS approval due 90 days later. As a reminder, our existing safety certificate remains in effect pending an OEIS decision on our timely filed new application. Earlier this month, at the Annual Board level safety briefing with the CPUC, our Utility Board Chair, Cheryl Campbell; and our Chief Operating Officer, Sumeet Singh discussed our safety culture, performance and details of our enterprise safety management system. These meetings are an element of our AB 1054 compliance and provide an opportunity to engage with regulators on our improvement strategies. We were encouraged to hear commissioners recognize our significant progress, while acknowledging our challenges including changing climate conditions. It's in moments like this that we step back and reflect on the progress being made. In fact at a recent meeting with all of our top leaders, Mark Quinlan, our SVP of Wildfire and Emergency Operations stood up to address the elephant in the room when he said, I bet you're all watching the weather and thinking back to 2017. Well, let me remind you just how much we've done since then. He went on to remind us all that we have an entirely different readiness posture and physical risk mitigation regime in place. Back in 2017, we were reacting and responding to hazards. The investments we've made since then have enabled a dramatic shift to predicting and preventing. Slide 6 illustrates the mitigations now in place thanks to these important investments in innovation. To name just a few. Since 2017, we have installed over 600 high-definition cameras now with AI capabilities more than 1,400 weather stations and almost 1,400 sectionalizing devices. We've hardened over 1,300 miles of line and undergrounded over 300 more. We've removed 3.3 million trees. We've staffed a hazard awareness warning center 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year and we've hired 130 fire prevention professionals who are on our PG&E team and making us safer every day. We've implemented a host of operational mitigations including enhanced power line safety settings on 44000 miles of line in and adjacent to our high fire risk areas. We've enabled public safety power shutoffs when conditions warrant them and new for 2023 we've deployed partial voltage force out and down conductor detection. Our system has never been safer and yet it will be even safer still tomorrow and every day after that. As we shared with the CPUC during the safety briefing we are making progress and we have more work to do. Safety permeates through everything we do and the presence of controls, including our layers of protection leads to manageable and predictable outcomes. I'm confident that we and our key partners including the state are doing everything we can to cause our stance catastrophic wildfires shall stop. The data tell the story. Through mid-July reportable ignitions in our high fire threat district have decreased 53% from the equivalent date in 2017. Last year, we saw a 68% reduction in ignitions on EPSS-enabled circuits and a 99% reduction in acres burned. The data so far suggests we are on track to see further improvement in 2023. Our hard work over the past five years has dramatically changed our risk exposure and the fundamental safety of our system and we aren't stopping there. Moving to slide 7. We also see profound changes in financial risk mitigation due to the framework put in place by SB 901 and AB 1054. At our Investor Day, you heard Ann Patterson Governor Newsom's Cabinet Secretary talk about how the state Wildfire Fund is working as planned. The AB 1054 construct is designed to give utilities and capital providers the financial assurance they need while deploying the investments required to bring down wildfire risk on the system over time. Let me quickly revisit the key features for those looking for a refresher or who may be newer to our story. For wildfire claims exceeding $1 billion in a calendar year, we have access to the state wildfire fund. This provides $21 billion of claim-paying capacity protecting investors from the risk of a liquidity event. Our annual wildfire mitigation plan is a requirement for receiving our annual safety certificate. So long as we have a valid safety certificate we have access to two additional key features of AB 1054. First, the utility's conduct is presumed to have been prudent upfront when it comes to seeking cost recovery at the CPUC along with the prudency standard modeled on the constructive FERC precedent. Second in the unlikely event of the utility being found to have acted imprudently any resulting obligation to reimburse the wildfire fund would be capped at 20% of electric T&D equity rate base on a three-year rolling basis. This cap is currently around $3 billion for PG&E. This is a much better construct than what was in place prior to SB 901 and AB 1054 and that enables the attraction of the necessary capital to build and operate a safe and climate resilient energy system. Turning to Slide 8. Let's review our regulatory and legislative time line. We've made progress on multiple fronts in the first half of the year including, approval of our wildfire self-insurance settlement, the Zogg Fire litigation settlement and 2022 WMCE Interim Rate release. Looking forward, we have several catalysts on the horizon, starting with a GRC final decision expected in the current quarter; the ongoing legislative session in Sacramento where we have seen constructive engagement on energization, which you've heard us previously refer to as new customer connections, showing the legislature's commitment to California's clean energy transition and then on our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan and safety certification processes. Looking a little further out, at the end of this year, we will file our nuclear operating license extension application for Diablo Canyon with NRC and we remain ready to submit our 10-year undergrounding plan once the OEIS and the CPUC complete their scoping process. On Slide 9, you have our 2023 report card where we're showing on track for each of our 2023 and long-term targets. This includes our plan to underground 350 miles in 2023, double last year's target and our 2024 FFO to debt target of mid-teens. As you can see, we're also projecting on track for our 2% non-fuel O&M reduction target, which brings me to my story of the month. This month's story illustrates how our regional service model together with our performance playbook and lean operating system is helping improve the customer experience while we eliminate waste and cost in our work processes. In the North Coast region field operations teams are improving upon a common sense approach that has worked in a lot of our programs bundling work. What's different now is that the teams are working across various branches of electric gas systems inspections and vegetation management to coordinate many types of work, not just bundling similar work in siloed programs as we've done in the past. Cross-functional work bundling allows crews to do more work under the same planned outage line clearance, reducing the cost of switching and grid operations and improving overall reliability. During Q2, my coworkers planned and executed 12 jobs under just one planned outage near the town of Willits. Rather than impacting 100-plus customers multiple times over the year, we did it all in just one go. That's one outage, one day of traffic lane closures, one batch of notifications and only one visit. This goes to show you what's possible when we put the customer at the center of our operations. So far this year, we estimate savings of $0.5 million and 800-plus hours when we did not have to deenergize our customers. This is just the tip of the iceberg and something we are working actively to scale up across all regions, proving we can deliver an improved customer experience while cutting costs all at the same time. This is all part of the momentum we're building here at PG&E. And with that, I'll turn it over to Carolyn. Thank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, I wanted to take a quick moment to highlight two other pieces of news from PG&E this week. Yesterday, we issued our annual corporate sustainability report which outlines major strides we've made towards the triple bottom-line of serving people the planet and California's prosperity. Using statistics and stories the report details meaningful action we took last year in service of our home towns throughout Northern and Central California. Second as highlighted here on slide 15 we hosted our inaugural Innovation Summit earlier this week drawing over 2,000 in-person and virtual participants from venture capital, technolog, academic and financial world. Risk mitigation in particular wildfire has rightly been Job one and our main priority. At the same time, our California service area is at the very forefront of the energy transition given our state's bold vision for the future. With this in mind, we created our innovation research and development team to capitalize on breakthrough opportunities drawing on the external innovation ecosystem to inspire bold new ideas for safety and our operations. For example, during the Innovation Summit, we featured a first-of-its-kind version of Schneider's electric distribution energy management system operating on the Microsoft Cloud. On the topic of innovation, I'm also pleased to announce that the XPrize competition featured at our Investor Day has already received interest from 120 individual teams out of 32 different countries. Talk about breakthrough opportunities. The objective of this competition is to be able to pinpoint ignitions from space within 60 seconds or less and autonomously suppress wildfires within 10 minutes. I'm excited to see what these brilliant minds produce. I'll wrap up on Slide 16, by saying we feel good about the progress we are making, mitigating physical and financial risk. We're confident in the protections we have in place for this wildfire season. And we see several catalysts ahead for investors including restoration of our common stock dividend and a final decision in our 2023 GRC. We see the progress and feel the momentum. We hope you do too. With that operator, please open up the line for questions. Good morning, Shar. Okay, Shar. Thank you for that's a very robust question. I'm going to get right at it. First let me remind you that our GRC is 85% safety, reliability, resilience work. Our customers are demanding this work of us and our stakeholders are really supportive of us doing this work. So I think that bodes very well for our GRC and its outcome. It's important that we remain aligned with our regulators to deliver on a very important regulatory outcome that is so important and so good for customers. So I'll just start with that. But just \u2013 I'll just back up and remind you about the timing. So the CPUC voted to extend the GRC deadline from June 30 to December 30. They needed that calendar so that the final decision could be issued still in Q3, which they have been pretty clear that it was going to be issued in Q3. So while the CPUC hasn't issued their proposed decision, the July 13 order included language that reinforced the timing. The commission, in fact the quote is that the commission still anticipates consideration of this matter on a commission agenda in the third quarter of 2023. We were very grateful for that reiteration of the importance of the timing. I think it's been really clear. We've been working closely with our stakeholders here in the state, how important it is that we get a timely GRC sold that. We can do this very important necessary work for our customers. So all that to say, obviously, we plan conservatively on the expected outcomes and we've got a plan that we think is defendable and is going to be welcomed by the commission but we're also putting in our contingency planning to make sure we're ready. Now I'll just close out with your final question about the implications for the dividend. I think Carolyn was very clear in our prepared remarks about the importance of the dividend, why we know that it's important to establish a dividend. But what's most important is that we're doing the right work for customers and we've got the GRC is obviously, the most important that we have a good GRC outcome. Now we're in the final stages of that GRC process. We've said that the dividend is dependent on regulatory timing, and I don't want to get ahead of ourselves at all here. We're going to watch how that plays out, and then we'll give an update and let you know the status on the third quarter call. And David all of that is contingent upon affordability for our customers and do we in fact have headroom to go ahead and add additional capital. And so all of our waste elimination work all of our cost savings work some of our big strategic efforts to reduce cost and get more streamlined and then the little itty-bitty ideas that all add up give us an opportunity to then deploy that more -- that capital for the benefit of customers when we can be sure that they can afford it. So that's always the equation that we're running. Thank you. Good morning, Julien. Yeah. I think -- two things just to recall I mean I'll reiterate the no new equity in 2023 and 2024. And we have a commitment to pay down the parent debt of about $2 billion plus by 2026. So in terms of that waiver, we're monitoring that. We're on track. We've made improvements over the last couple of years and we continue to foresee those improvements. And we don't -- if the waiver is in place until we'll be able to make that waiver until June 2025, yeah, I thought it was 2025 sorry. Couldn't it remember it was June or March? Great. Thanks, Julien. Good morning, Ryan. Yeah. No it's primarily the GRC, Ryan. Yeah. Ryan that innovation summit was just spectacular. We opened the doors to the future with thousands of people participated in that event from all across the globe. We have people signed in from Australia and Israel and UK and all across the country here in the US as well. We have standing room only here in California. It was very fun to see the appetite to support our True North strategy and the key enablers to a pathway to the clean energy transition and a robust gas system. It was really exciting to imagine how all those partnerships might emerge from that date. And I'm glad so many investors signed on for that day as well. But back to your question about AI. First of all, I'll remind you that we've been using artificial intelligence already. And in fact in 2019, we introduced our wildfire spread model. That's the technology [ph] platform that helps us forecast where our highest risks are and what a wildfire spread might look like. We operationalize that artificial intelligence in 2021. And we've been utilizing that routinely. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. We're also using AI for asset health as we do our inspections and then coordinating between drone inspections and data collection. It's very hard for humans to review photos. We take all of these images and humans can make an error, it's a judgment. But an artificial intelligence platform that can review all of those visual images can truly automate our response and then build into our asset health plan what next might fail and be predictive in that way. And so we're pretty excited about the application of AI to continue our system safety efforts and our asset health. But then there are simple things, like just automating simple back office processes and administrative tasks. So we're playing with that. And then things like customer service. And so we're really excited about the applications of artificial intelligence. We know there's, things to be cautious about and we're working to make sure that any platform that we use protects our customers' data and any kind of company secret data. We make sure that that safety exists for our data as well as our physical assets, so, much more to come in AI for PG&E for sure. Yeah. We have several California initiatives. So things like the California Climate Credit. We accelerated that earlier this year so that it was during the heating season to offset some of those gas charges that were so high at the beginning of the year. We have our Income Qualified Customer Assistance Programs. We call that CARE. It's a very robust income-qualified program to help customers, who don't have the ability to always afford their utility bill. We make sure that they're cared for and have the energy that they need. There's a California Arrearage Payment Program, where for example, more than 300,000 customers who were experiencing financial hardships during the pandemic, received an automatic one-time build credit in February of 2023. And then, back to your innovation point, earlier Ryan, the $83 million EPIC program is a source of funding so that we can invest in doing new technologies that make it safer and more affordable for customers in the future. So that's a really exciting part of our portfolio too that benefits customers. You're welcome. Thanks, Ryan. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. I know you've got a busy calendar. And we're grateful for your time. And we look forward to seeing you soon. Be safe out there."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PG&E Corporation First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Arnold, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; Chris Foster, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carolyn Burke, our Executive Vice President of Finance, who will step into the CFO role later today. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results, are described on the second page of today's first quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides, along with other relevant information, can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which was released earlier today. And with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\nPatricia Poppe : Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by noting that this will be Chris Foster's last earnings call with PG&E. Thank you, Chris, for your commitment and service to our company over the past 11 years. Since we announced our CFO transition in March, Chris has worked tirelessly to ensure an orderly transition to Carolyn Burke, who will formally take over as our CFO later today. So thank you, Chris, for your friendship, your leadership and your dedication to serving our customers and investors. And a formal welcome to Carolyn, who brings a wealth of financial experience to PG&E as we continue on our journey remaking the company as a top-performing regulated utility. You'll all have opportunities to get to know Carolyn at upcoming events, including at our Investor Day in California later this month. We know you have a lot of calls occurring today. And since we've had a strong quarter, and we'll be seeing many of you in just a couple of weeks, we'll be crisp and to the point. Let's get started. Turning to our results on Slide 3. You'll see we reported first quarter 2023 non-GAAP core earnings of $0.29 per share. This result keeps us on track with our plan for the year. One timing item to consider is our 2023 general rate case. As is common with California GRCs, we have a memo account in place, which will allow for new rates to be implemented retroactive to January 1, meaning that after the final decision is reached, we'd expect to begin recognizing the GRC outcome along with the prior quarter's catch-up. The case schedule calls for a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision in the third quarter. We continue to communicate with all stakeholders to how important it is to have a timely decision in order to have the resources we need to deliver for our customers. Also today, we reaffirm our full year 2023 core EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 10% over 2022. We also reaffirm our previously stated longer-term targets of at least 10% core EPS growth in 2024 and at least 9% for 2025 and 2026. Also unchanged is our plan for no new equity issuance through 2024. As we've said before, we'll work to manage the business through ups and downs like weather, regulatory timing, interest rates and inflation, while delivering the safety and reliability investments that our customers need and the consistent financial results our investors expect. Here on Slide 4, I'll review some of the highlights and proof points as we continue to make progress on mitigating risk, both physical and financial. On wildfire risk mitigation, we filed our 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan at the end of March, which further builds on the layers of protection approach from our 2022 plan. Record winter rains and snowfall have left our hydro assets in a stronger position than they've been in for some years. CEMA, our Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account is one of the constructive features of the California regulatory model. It enables us to focus on serving customers when they need us the most, while we track and defer for future recovery much of the costs associated with these historic weather events. We recorded several hundred million dollars of repair and restoration work to the CEMA account between December and March. Meanwhile, our customer restoration efforts and storm response have been well received in our communities, and our performance benefited from the investments we have made in technology, situational awareness and emergency response coordination. We've also continued to see more constructive policy outcomes, building on last year's passage of legislation supporting our establishment of a 10-year undergrounding plan as well as the state's decision to extend the life of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. Highlights in the first quarter include our wildfire self-insurance plan, which enjoyed unusually strong support from interveners. We were also pleased to receive the Nuclear Regulatory Commission waiver, allowing our two Diablo Canyon nuclear units to continue operating beyond their current license expiration date, while the NRC is considering the renewal applications. We expect to file our applications with the NRC by year-end. And most recently, in the past week, we were encouraged by the proposed decision issued in our 2022 WMCE proceeding. This would grant our full request for $1.1 billion of interim rate relief while allowing for collection over 12 months, also as requested. The PD could be voted out by the CPUC as soon as the June 8 meeting, and we will be advocating for a timely adoption so that customer benefits can be realized. These benefits include millions of dollars in customer financing savings as well as providing cash funding to accelerate investment. This will facilitate us delivering needed safety, reliability and customer connections work. I'm also happy to report on continued progress mitigating financial risk. Our simple, affordable model and deployment of waste elimination, the fifth play of our lean operating system, enables improving the customer experience while keeping us on track to deliver our 2% annual O&M savings in spite of weather and inflation. Also, in support of customer affordability, we worked with the state to offset commodity price increases on winter bills with an acceleration of the annual California Climate Credit. Overall, during the winter gas commodity price run-ups, our procurement team was able to save customers over $1 billion through a series of thoughtful measures including a diversified portfolio that includes interstate pipeline capacity reaching back to the supply basins, natural gas storage and financial hedging. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to estimate that our layers of protection have mitigated over 90% of wildfire risk through the combination of inspection, physical hardening, our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings, Public Safety Power Shutoffs and improved situational awareness and response. While 2022 did not bring the typical high-wind events that would trigger PSPS, we did see an increase of over 30% in high fire risk base given the significant drought conditions. Despite this increased risk, our EPSS program resulted in a reduction of 69% in CPUC reportable admissions, along with 99% fewer acres impacted for EPSS-enabled mines versus the pre-EPSS baseline or 2018 to 2020 average. Our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan builds on these core elements and will also see us deploy additional operational mitigations such as partial voltage detection, which leverages our existing smart meters and our down conductor detection with a plan to install over 1,100 new enabled devices on the system by the end of 2023, translating to over 75% coverage of high fire risk areas. Other programs being expanded for 2023 include our transmission pole clearing, our transmission operational controls, and further measures, including EPS sectionalizing to reduce customer impact. We expect to be sharing more with you on the incremental risk reduction associated with these programs at our Investor Day later in the month. Slide 6 is a reminder of our simple, affordable model, which continues to sit at the heart of our customer value proposition. We remain on track to deliver on at least 2% annual non-fuel O&M reduction with our wildfire self-insurance and incremental vegetation management savings, providing line of sight on continuing to offset inflationary pressures this year. That's a good moment to bring up my story in the month, which has to do with revisiting the way we approach our work, and in this case, in our undergrounding program and how we're eliminating waste in our process. Historically, hitting these internal standards had required our underground electric lines to have at least 36 inches of cover. Upon revisiting this approach and reviewing regulations and the practices of other undergrounding utilities, we determined that 36 inches of cover is not required in most places, and there's little evidence that incrementally deeper conduits are meaningfully safer or more reliable than slightly shallower conduits. Therefore, in Q4 of last year, we revised our standard to only require 30 inches of cover, unless, of course, otherwise directed by permitting authority. While these may not seem like much, this 6-inch change in depth reduces the labor hours required to install our underground conduits and reduces the amount of spoils created during our trenching activities by approximately 17%. We're estimating that this change of 6 inches will save at least $25 million in 2023 alone. That's lower cost for our customers for the same ultimate value, getting our electric distribution lines underground and permanently reducing the risk. This is just the beginning of our waste elimination efforts. We're benchmarking with peers and reviewing where it's appropriate to put the conduits 24 inches deep, another 6 inches of potential savings, and we're analyzing the entire undergrounding delivery process through a value stream mapping exercise to identify further opportunities for efficiency, better customer and co-worker engagement and even more waste elimination. So many practices in large organizations like ours get memorialized and standardized into waste. Our fifth play and our focus on it will unlock value for customers in large and small ways for decades to come. Slide 7 recaps some of the key regulatory and policy catalysts we have in front of us for 2023. The one minor change is for Pacific Generation, where the ALJ recently added about a month to the schedule in response to request for additional time from the interveners. This will likely push the proposed decision from late 2023 into early 2024. And the sooner we get a final decision, the sooner we can bring the expected benefits to our customers. We know there is a lot on the plate at the CPUC at this time. We also know that we want what they want, a safer and more reliable system, which has enabled with timely approval of necessary infrastructure investments. In the meantime, we're improving our processes to make every dollar go further and building the case for the right investments to meet customers' expectations. I'll end here on Slide 8, with our report card reflecting on-track status for all of our operational and financial targets. I'm pleased to say we're on track to deliver on our commitments to both our customers and our investors despite the early challenges from winter storms. We are confident we have built a resilient conservative plan, which is designed to absorb the ups and downs of the business and the markets. As I like to say, we'll ride that roller coaster so you don't have to. And before I hand this over to Chris and Carolyn, I'll leave you with two additional notes on the financial front. First, we look forward to being eligible to reinstate our common dividend later this year, which we view as a key step in our return to financial health and essential for attracting the capital we need to deliver for our customers. As we announced on the year-end call, we expect to hit the required earnings level in the third quarter. Second, we've been encouraged to see the Fire Victim Trust continuing to monetize their stockholding and at growing values. The trust now owns around 6% of our stock, and as of last week, had distributed over $9 billion to their beneficiaries. And now I'll hand it over to Chris for some financial highlights.\nChris Foster: Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2023 and 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're also reaffirming our commitment to no equity in 2023 or 2024. As Patti mentioned, we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitment. This morning, I'm pleased to have Carolyn Burke joining me for the financial update. We plan to cover three main topics with you. To start, I'll review the drivers of our Q1 2023 financial results and review the key performance factors that we expect to see in the remaining nine months to deliver our full year 10% EPS growth. Carolyn and I will next provide a few highlights on regulatory, legal and legislative items. And Carolyn will then close this out with the reiteration of our value proposition. Let's start on Slide 9. On this slide, we're showing our results for the quarter and drivers we're forecasting for the next nine months as we locked our full year guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. For the first quarter, our results came in at $0.29. Versus first quarter last year, you see $0.02 of benefit from lower operating and maintenance costs, partially offset by $0.01 of redeployment. The lower O&M spend is a result of the storms Patti spoke about earlier. With many of our co-workers activated on storm duty, less planned core work was completed during the first quarter of this year. This allowed us to redeploy funds to operational and enterprise programs. This nimble shift in priorities and execution is made possible by the capabilities we're building here at PG&E, enabled by our lean operating system. Finally, you'll see we're calling out $0.02 of other, including some timing items. What you don't see is a meaningful impact directly from the storms. That is because of our long-established CEMA mechanism, which is an important constructive component of California utility regulation. Another driver not reflected explicitly, but to keep in mind, is a benefit from customer capital investment or rate base growth. As you know, a final decision in our 2023 general rate case is expected in the third quarter of this year. Consistent with past cases that Patti described, we will be allowed to record those catch-up revenues for prior quarters once the final decision is received. We're also reiterating our commitment and consistent focus on executing annual 2% non-fuel O&M reductions. I'll remind you that we're planning conservatively and plan to deliver on target, no more, no less, redeploying any excess back into the business for the benefit of our customers. On Slide 10, our customer capital investments have not changed from year-end. We have tremendous opportunities to invest capital into our system for the benefit of customers to advance California's ambitious climate goals and support growing customer demand with the adoption of electric vehicles. This growth benefits our customers and our investors while providing additional cash flow from operations. And our simple, affordable model is how we plan to make this manageable for customers. Moving to Slide 11. In 2022, we exceeded our non-fuel O&M cost reduction target, taking 3% out of the business despite inflation. We use those savings to serve customers and derisk the 2023 plan, which assumes continued inflationary cost pressures. As I mentioned on the year-end call, we see more opportunities for customers ahead, and the team is just getting started in terms of finding cost savings and eliminating waste. Let's move to Slide 12. We believe performance is power. So we intend to continue to deliver on operational commitments serving our customers better and making our systems safer every day. We expect that delivering these results will help us achieve better regulatory and financial outcomes, and California has the regulatory structure in place to help us do just that. Starting at the top of the slide, our 2023 cost of capital is final at 10%. This decision covers the three-year period through 2025, providing certainty for our investors. The cost of capital decision also continues to provide for a trigger mechanism. Should interest rates remain where they are and the mechanism trigger, we would intend to file with the commission for an upward adjustment, consistent with the mechanism. Next is our pending 2023 general rate case. As a reminder, we've already reached resolution on our wildfire self-insurance settlement, saving customers up to $1.8 billion through 2026. Worth noting is that over 85% of our requested revenue requirement increase seeks to mitigate risk in our gas and electric operations and deliver a level of safety that our customers expect and deserve. Our Pacific Generation allocation continues to move through the CPUC process. A final decision is now expected in early 2024 based on the schedule update from the ALJ. We are gearing up to launch the marketing on a parallel path, and we expect to do so this quarter. I'll next cover our pending wildfire-related cost recovery applications. With our 2020 WMCE costs now in rates, the net unresolved balance at the end of the first quarter is approximately $4.8 billion. We've settled our 2021 WMCE, resolving all elements apart from the cost in our Vegetation Management Balancing Account. As Patti mentioned, in the past week, we were pleased to receive a proposed decision recommending that we be granted 100% of the interim rate relief we had requested in our 2022 WMCE application. This amounts to some $1.1 billion over 12 months. This will be a constructive recognition of the importance of timely cash recovery, a key focus for the company. Not only would this outcome reduce financing costs for customers, it would also result in tangible work being executed sooner than would otherwise have been the case, including in the current year. The recently published schedule calls for a final decision in the overall 2022 WMCE application as soon as Q1 of next year. We're advocating for timely resolution in all of our WMCE cases. Resulting cash flow will allow us to accelerate our progress toward improved balance sheet health, improving FFO to debt and providing resources to enable us to meet customer growth demands on the system faster.  It's my pleasure to now hand it over to Carolyn Burke.\nCarolyn Burke : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everybody. At the bottom of this slide, we're highlighting some milestones and next steps of the two key pieces of state legislation passed last year. In addition to the DOE confirmation that Diablo Canyon is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program, we were also granted a waiver by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue operating the units beyond their current license expiration dates, while we work through the full relicensing process. Also during the first quarter, the California Energy Commission in consultation with the CAISO and CPUC issued a needs determination, supporting extended operations at Diablo Canyon to provide electric system reliability in the state. Finally, in terms of the undergrounding, I'll remind you that the pending 2023 general rate case includes our request through 2026, as does our recently filed 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. We will be prepared to file our 10-year plan later this year, dependent on the guidance from the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety. Once we file, OEIS will have nine months to review before going to the CPUC, who will also have nine months for their review. Now as many of you know, California is my new home. As shown here on Slide 13, I'm quickly and happily learning that California's regulatory construct makes this a great place to do business. In addition to the protections provided for under Assembly Bill 1054 and the CEMA tracker Patti and Chris discussed earlier, PG&E also benefits from decoupled rates and a three-year cost of capital set independently from a four-year forward-looking rate case. And this is just to name a few. Our strong regulatory environment is an advantage that we will never take for granted. As Chris mentioned, performance is power, and we know we must perform. We understand that affordable customer bills help us not only mitigate financial and regulatory risk, but also importantly, help us as we continue to build trust with our customers, our regulators and our policymakers. As the incoming CFO, I intend to continue to build upon the sector-differentiating simple, affordable model that Patti and Chris put in place. The implementation of our lean operating system is helping PG&E improve the customer experience, reduce O&M, enhance capital work plan throughput and quite simply, making PG&E a more enjoyable place to work for and with. This year, as part of engaging our co-workers on a lean method of waste elimination, we've established our waste elimination center. We are already tracking over 200 projects across the enterprise, and we're finding common themes throughout the business. First, there's a whole lot of over-processing. And second, there's a whole lot of defects requiring rework. That means a whole lot of opportunity. My co-workers are excited about tackling these issues and projects and driving improvements for the benefit of our customers. We're going after big and small opportunities, some simple and some complex. Take this simple example of customer mailings. U.S. postage rates are expected to increase about 7% this year. While we have no control over these mailing rates, we do control what we send to our customers. This waste elimination project is looking at what communications we can digitize or eliminate altogether. If we just eliminated one mailing per household per year, that's approximately $4 million in saved postage. As you can imagine, we're not stopping with just one mailing, and this elimination project saves more than just postage. As Patti mentioned earlier, we're going after large waste elimination projects, too, including in our undergrounding program. The team is excited to show you more examples out in the yard during our Investor Day in May, where we'll demonstrate waste elimination driving real unit cost savings and making permanent risk reduction affordable for our customers. I'll end here on Slide 14 by saying that our value proposition is strong, and it's improving every day. We are progressing towards meeting the common stock dividend eligibility threshold later this year. As a reminder, before declaring a dividend, we will first need to recognize a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11, starting from the third quarter 2020. For this purpose, non-GAAP core earnings means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain noncore items as described in our plan of reorganization. Our plan currently shows us reaching eligibility during the third quarter, although this remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of regulatory decisions. I'll remind you that regardless of timing, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start with a small dividend initially, feathering in growth over time. I'll leave you with this: We're on track for 2023 EPS growth target of at least 10%, at least 10% in 2024, at least 9% in 2025 and at least 9% in 2026. I'm looking forward to getting the chance to meet many of you in person during our upcoming Investor Day in California later this month. And lastly, I'd like to thank Chris for his generous support and advice during this transition period. I can't say enough about the incredibly strong team he has built here. Thank you, Chris.\nChris Foster: Thanks, Carolyn. I'd like to say it's been my privilege to serve as CFO here at PG&E and my time in prior roles over the last 11.5 years. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished, and we've built very strong five and 10-year plans. The emphasis now shifts to sound execution, which I have the utmost confidence this team can achieve. I'm also very confident that I'm handing the baton over to a very talented leader who we have shortly come to know as the perfect choice to take PG&E's finance organization through its next chapter.  With that, I'll hand it back to Patti to wrap.\nPatricia Poppe : Thank you again, Chris, and welcome, Carol. In closing, we are solidly on track for another year of consistent performance in 2023. We look forward to sharing more details with you on our progress and our confidence in the outlook at our California Investor Day on May 24 and May 25. While we do have a virtual option for the main slide presentation, for those of you wondering whether to make the trip, there will be a lot more for you to see and experience outside of that webcast window. We'll be showcasing some of our key technology, including wildfire risk reduction, EPSS and undergrounding. We also want to give you a better understanding of why we're confident we can execute our plan, including our 10,000-mile undergrounding program. At our in-person event, you'll also get to hear directly from key California stakeholders, including policymakers, customers and other critical partners as we continue writing the next chapter of the PG&E story. We really hope to see you here in this great state of California at the end of the month. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Fleishman at Wolfe.\nSteven Fleishman : So just first, any color in thinking on the situation going into this fire season just with all the rains and et cetera, just how you're thinking about how things stand versus the last few years?\nPatricia Poppe : Yes. It's a great question, Steve. I know a lot of people have been wondering this. So I'll share a couple of things. One, we know that in some ways, the storms were beneficial from the perspective that trees -- aged and dying trees came down and at a time when fire was not a risk. So certainly, that was an advantage. But we also know that the fuels -- the grasses have a rich crop this year. But here's the thing that I want investors to really understand is the mitigations that we've put in place and the technology that we have deployed with EPSS gives us the ability to know in 2-kilometer blocks across our entire service area, what the conditions are real time, whether that's fuel moisture levels, wind conditions, temperatures, et cetera, grass levels, we know our system. And so EPSS puts us in a position to, regardless of weather and regardless of conditions, be prepared and derisk the system. It gives me a lot of confidence heading into wildfire season that we are prepared.\nSteven Fleishman : Okay. Good. And then second question, just I have to ask again on the Fire Victim Trust, any sense on their kind of strategy or timing from here? In theory, I guess, you're close to the end? Any sense on that?\nPatricia Poppe : Well, I would suggest we are close to the end, Steve. They're less -- well, there are just over a 6% holder today. And in their annual report, they've described their intentions. And we know that it's just less and less of a factor for us, and we're gratified. And I think the agreement worked out well for the beneficiaries as we've been -- as they've been able to sell their shares at an increasing value. So we feel like we've done our part to make it right, which has been a big priority for us.\nSteven Fleishman : Makes sense. Great. And then just lastly on the GRC and the proposed decision. Just are you getting any sense of the timing within the second quarter and just the likelihood that it will actually come out in the second quarter and not get delayed?\nPatricia Poppe : Well, I think we've been really clear with our stakeholders, and I do appreciate that the commission has a lot on their plate, but we all understand, and they want what we want, which is a safe system, which requires investment in the infrastructure. We just continue to reinforce, the timely outcome on the GRC is really important, and we expect that they'll keep to the timing that they've published.\nOperator: We'll move next to Shar Pourreza at Guggenheim.\nShahriar Pourreza : Just wanted to -- Patti, if it's okay, just start off on the dividend, especially as we're getting closer to that eligibility threshold. I guess, what adjustments should we be thinking about beyond non-GAAP to get to that $6.4 billion net income threshold? And then more importantly, just in terms of timing, how long do you kind of anticipate it would take after meeting the threshold to actually kind of initiate the dividend? So if you meet the threshold in 3Q, would you have a tentative plan in place for framework, Board approval, et cetera? Or is there more back and forth that you anticipate as we think about the actual payment date?\nCarolyn Burke : Yes. Sure. This is Carolyn. I'll take that question. So we've been pretty consistent, as you know, that we would -- we do expect to meet that eligibility in the third quarter. Our current plan suggests -- continues to suggest that. On the adjustments, so our plan of reorganization has a very specific calculation for the dividend eligible earnings. And it is different from what we report as non-GAAP core earnings. There are some very specific line item adjustments. And our IR team would be happy to walk through that methodology with you separately. But I just want to make sure that you know that it is separate. It is different. On a practical matter, we want to have our audited financial statements to be able to support the eligibility of that calculation. So the earliest our Board would have the opportunity to declare a dividend would be with our third quarter earnings call. So that's the expectation at this point in time. Of course, it is subject, I will just say, to the GRC decision, some various regulatory decisions that we're expecting in the third quarter.\nPatricia Poppe : Yes. And Shar, this is Patti. I'll just pile on here with Carolyn, our capital allocation decisions are always about investing in the system, making sure that our priority is to make the system safer, faster, meet the needs of our customers. And so we're going to continue to balance that as we factor in the decision about size and pacing of growth.\nShahriar Pourreza : Got it. And then just on the -- now that the undergrounding program is in place, PMO is engaged. I guess, how are your thoughts evolving around longer-term undergrounding plan? Any expectations for that filing? And do you see any constructive variances versus the last update in the GRC.\nPatricia Poppe : Yes. We're getting excited as we continue to make progress and build out this program. It's such an exciting part of the company, and the team leading it is just doing an incredible job learning new things and getting best practices from across other utilities and getting started. And so we're excited to file that 10-year plan. We expect that the 10-year plan will very much reflect our GRC and the four years that were included in our GRC. And just to remind that, that pending filing shows us doubling our mileage here in 2023 getting to 350 miles, ramping up to 450 miles in 2024, 550 miles in 2026 and then 750 miles in 2026 -- 550 miles, sorry, in 2025 and 750 miles in 2026. That ramp will be consistent with what we filed in our 10-year plan. And so based on the timing of that 10-year plan, we are waiting on feedback from OEIS on when they will receive that plan. We're ready to file that when they are ready to receive it. They're staffing up so that they can receive it. But I do think it's important for people to know that the first four years, including this year -- or the next four years, including this year, are reflected already in our GRC, including, obviously, the cost recovery associated with that. And so depending on the timing of the OEIS' availability to receive our 10-year plan has little bearing on the initial years of our undergrounding program.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Let me start off with this. I mean, you guys have this Analyst Day coming up, and I want to call out, you have your earnings growth rate through '26, and you guys have been very careful to acknowledge the specific discrete growth rates in each year. You have your rate base growth through '27, how are you thinking about addressing if at all, some of the earnings considerations at the upcoming Analyst Day? I know that you've really placed an emphasis here on understanding the core of what you guys are doing, specifically in undergrounding at this Analyst Day. But I just wanted to call out that discrepancy between RAB and earnings growth, for instance, heading into this Analyst Day, if there were any expectations to set.\nPatricia Poppe : Well, Julien, we take great pride in giving you multiple years' forward expectations on earnings. I would suggest that there are some -- especially with the GRC coming out late after Investor Day that it's unlikely that we'll forecast any further than 2026, but we're pretty proud of the fact that we're giving you guidance through 2026.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : No. I hear you. I just wanted to test that. I appreciate it though. I very much appreciate the considerations they're in. separately and related here, can we talk about the Pacific Gen sale, and I understand and saw in your prepared remarks here some of the tweaks and timing with the ALJ, et cetera. But can you specifically address a little bit more your expectations today, where the conversations are with potential buyers and any of the consternation that might be coming up through the process as well from the regulatory side?\nCarolyn Burke : Yes. No, I'll take that. This is Carolyn. We've actually seen pretty robust inbound interest in the asset. And so we do expect a fairly competitive process. I will say that the opportunity seems to be most interesting to those long-term infrastructure investors, but we have seen a wide range of interest. The portfolio, obviously, is pretty unique in that it offers exposure to the full cost of service, regulated clean generation in California and without the direct risk of wildfires. So it's pretty attractive. And timing, as we've already mentioned, I mean it's really -- we do -- we've updated that. We're going to be going to market with investor -- with our process coming up in June is the expectation, so early summer. And then we would still expect that process to go forward through the balance of the year, simultaneous with the regulatory process and wouldn't expect to be closing until the first half of 2024.\nOperator: We'll go next to Anthony Crowdell at Mizuho Securities.\nAnthony Crowdell : Just hopefully two quick questions. One on the cost of capital triggering mechanism. I believe that utility is going to file if rates stay where they are for an increase in cost of capital for 2024. Do you expect parties to follow for a waiver, similar to, I think, what the utility sale for a waiver for in 2022 for the mechanism not to get reset lower? Is there an expectation that you do get parties also filing for a waiver?\nChris Foster: No, Anthony, I think it's really a couple of considerations. First, there's a phase 2 piece of this to keep in mind. So the commission is examining both the trigger itself and its treatment as well as an issue rerate, which is the yield spread adjustment in particular. So those are two that will be considered in the phase 2. There's not actually a specific time frame around it. Stepping back and looking at the core of your question, I think you should assume from our standpoint that we would be filing for the upward adjustment, really consistent with that mechanism, Hard for me to predict where other interveners would come in. But at this stage, that would be our intention. From a planning standpoint, you can imagine if there is the potential for that trigger to trigger to the upside, that could actually just strengthen our plan further and provide us more capability to put more into the system.\nAnthony Crowdell : Great. And then lastly, Patti, it's on your, I guess, story of the month, I think you framed it as -- or savings a month of the undergrounding. And I understand the savings that you get by not having to bury the conduit, whatever, 36 inches and now you're at 26, but if I think of the -- probably a large component of the cost of undergrounding, maybe labor. And if I think of PG&E is probably on their gas side has been burying gas pipe for 100 years. Like I don't -- can I expect any efficiencies in the digging trenches and putting a conduit down, that great considering you've been -- you probably have mastered the trenching of a conduit from the gas side of the business?\nPatricia Poppe : Anthony, that's a great question. And first of all, I do remind people that all the time that we've been burying pipe for a long time. However, I would say the synergies that exist are that we can deploy our workforce. We actually have a program called GTE, gas to electric, where we're enabling our gas workforce to do a lot of the civil work. All that to say, this undergrounding of electric lines has new technologies that we can deploy today that we're pretty excited about. And you'll get a chance to see those at our Investor Day, the actual equipment, whether it's a rock wheel or a plow-type piece of equipment or even at grade conduit in what's something called K rail, which we'll be able to show you all these things at Investor Day. There's still much, much efficiency that we can gain, and we're really excited about all of the progress and the ideas that we're getting both from our partners as well as from our own work team in our gas division. So there's definitely a great synergy there to leverage.\nOperator: And we'll take the next question from Ryan Levine at Citi.\nRyan Levine : I guess to follow up on the waste elimination center comments, can you expand what type of projects or initiatives you're tracking beyond mail postage? I mean how material are some of these opportunities? Or any way to frame the scale?\nPatricia Poppe : Yes. Well, the scale is really massive, Ryan. It starts -- I think the book ends of the mailing, which is $4 million of potential savings with just 1 mailing, all the way up to the story that I shared about the undergrounding, that's all borne out of waste elimination. Some other important focus areas for us in the waste elimination center are things like our new customer connection process improvement. I know that's an area of interest for a lot of people, and we've been making significant progress there in identifying waste in that process that we can eliminate and make a better outcome, a faster outcome for customers at a lower cost as well as other things like just bundling work. We have work often done in silos. So on one week, a crew might go out and change a cross arm and two weeks later, they might go out and change that very same pole. And so bundling work so that we get out there once and do it at the lowest cost possible and least disruptive for customers. The potential here, Ryan, I cannot describe is almost infinite. And when we get 26,000 of my co-workers all being proficient in being able to see waste for what it is and then eliminate it on a daily basis, this thing just runs itself. That's a -- it's a great future that lies ahead for this team and therefore, our customers.\nRyan Levine : Good to hear. In terms of the CEMA exposure in the early part of the quarter, where is the balance for that as of the end of the quarter? And any time line for recovery through the regulatory process?\nChris Foster: Sure. Just to help give you a feel for that. What we had filed earlier, Ryan, was a little over $300 million in impact so far. I will offer to you that's early. That number is going to go up. I would assume we're going to be in total -- if you look at all the storm impacts, we're talking about 13 atmospheric rivers of impacts here, this is probably going to be over $500 million in impact. The CEMA related account, though, is a very consistent recovery mechanism. But as you go forward, we would typically complete the work, audit the work, make that filing, and you typically get around an 18-month to two-year time line for resolution but been used really here in California for many years.\nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for closing remarks.\nPatricia Poppe : Thanks, Audra. And we really wanted to be mindful of everyone's time today and keeping this call short. So I'll just wrap with one -- couple of thoughts. One, our best wishes to Chris as he embarks on his next professional step. We're going to miss him, but we're excited and proud of everything that he's achieved and what he's going to achieve next. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Days on May 24 and 25. We're excited to see that many of you have already registered, high demand for this event. So we're excited about that. There will be much for you to see live. It will not be possible on the webcast. And so we still have room, if you'd just like to join us, just make sure you register. We are definitely seeing progress here at PG&E. And we want to be able to share that with you at our Investor Day. We want you to know that an investment in PCG is an investment in serving people, the planet and prosperity of many millions. And we're very proud of the progress that the team is making here. I want to share that with you at Investor Day. So we look forward to seeing you there. Please be safe out there, everyone. Have a great day.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carolyn Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everybody. At the bottom of this slide, we're highlighting some milestones and next steps of the two key pieces of state legislation passed last year. In addition to the DOE confirmation that Diablo Canyon is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program, we were also granted a waiver by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue operating the units beyond their current license expiration dates, while we work through the full relicensing process. Also during the first quarter, the California Energy Commission in consultation with the CAISO and CPUC issued a needs determination, supporting extended operations at Diablo Canyon to provide electric system reliability in the state. Finally, in terms of the undergrounding, I'll remind you that the pending 2023 general rate case includes our request through 2026, as does our recently filed 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. We will be prepared to file our 10-year plan later this year, dependent on the guidance from the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety. Once we file, OEIS will have nine months to review before going to the CPUC, who will also have nine months for their review. Now as many of you know, California is my new home. As shown here on Slide 13, I'm quickly and happily learning that California's regulatory construct makes this a great place to do business. In addition to the protections provided for under Assembly Bill 1054 and the CEMA tracker Patti and Chris discussed earlier, PG&E also benefits from decoupled rates and a three-year cost of capital set independently from a four-year forward-looking rate case. And this is just to name a few. Our strong regulatory environment is an advantage that we will never take for granted. As Chris mentioned, performance is power, and we know we must perform. We understand that affordable customer bills help us not only mitigate financial and regulatory risk, but also importantly, help us as we continue to build trust with our customers, our regulators and our policymakers. As the incoming CFO, I intend to continue to build upon the sector-differentiating simple, affordable model that Patti and Chris put in place. The implementation of our lean operating system is helping PG&E improve the customer experience, reduce O&M, enhance capital work plan throughput and quite simply, making PG&E a more enjoyable place to work for and with. This year, as part of engaging our co-workers on a lean method of waste elimination, we've established our waste elimination center. We are already tracking over 200 projects across the enterprise, and we're finding common themes throughout the business. First, there's a whole lot of over-processing. And second, there's a whole lot of defects requiring rework. That means a whole lot of opportunity. My co-workers are excited about tackling these issues and projects and driving improvements for the benefit of our customers. We're going after big and small opportunities, some simple and some complex. Take this simple example of customer mailings. U.S. postage rates are expected to increase about 7% this year. While we have no control over these mailing rates, we do control what we send to our customers. This waste elimination project is looking at what communications we can digitize or eliminate altogether. If we just eliminated one mailing per household per year, that's approximately $4 million in saved postage. As you can imagine, we're not stopping with just one mailing, and this elimination project saves more than just postage. As Patti mentioned earlier, we're going after large waste elimination projects, too, including in our undergrounding program. The team is excited to show you more examples out in the yard during our Investor Day in May, where we'll demonstrate waste elimination driving real unit cost savings and making permanent risk reduction affordable for our customers. I'll end here on Slide 14 by saying that our value proposition is strong, and it's improving every day. We are progressing towards meeting the common stock dividend eligibility threshold later this year. As a reminder, before declaring a dividend, we will first need to recognize a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11, starting from the third quarter 2020. For this purpose, non-GAAP core earnings means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain noncore items as described in our plan of reorganization. Our plan currently shows us reaching eligibility during the third quarter, although this remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of regulatory decisions. I'll remind you that regardless of timing, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start with a small dividend initially, feathering in growth over time. I'll leave you with this: We're on track for 2023 EPS growth target of at least 10%, at least 10% in 2024, at least 9% in 2025 and at least 9% in 2026. I'm looking forward to getting the chance to meet many of you in person during our upcoming Investor Day in California later this month. And lastly, I'd like to thank Chris for his generous support and advice during this transition period. I can't say enough about the incredibly strong team he has built here. Thank you, Chris. Yes. Sure. This is Carolyn. I'll take that question. So we've been pretty consistent, as you know, that we would -- we do expect to meet that eligibility in the third quarter. Our current plan suggests -- continues to suggest that. On the adjustments, so our plan of reorganization has a very specific calculation for the dividend eligible earnings. And it is different from what we report as non-GAAP core earnings. There are some very specific line item adjustments. And our IR team would be happy to walk through that methodology with you separately. But I just want to make sure that you know that it is separate. It is different. On a practical matter, we want to have our audited financial statements to be able to support the eligibility of that calculation. So the earliest our Board would have the opportunity to declare a dividend would be with our third quarter earnings call. So that's the expectation at this point in time. Of course, it is subject, I will just say, to the GRC decision, some various regulatory decisions that we're expecting in the third quarter. Yes. No, I'll take that. This is Carolyn. We've actually seen pretty robust inbound interest in the asset. And so we do expect a fairly competitive process.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Chris Foster",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2023 and 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're also reaffirming our commitment to no equity in 2023 or 2024. As Patti mentioned, we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitment. This morning, I'm pleased to have Carolyn Burke joining me for the financial update. We plan to cover three main topics with you. To start, I'll review the drivers of our Q1 2023 financial results and review the key performance factors that we expect to see in the remaining nine months to deliver our full year 10% EPS growth. Carolyn and I will next provide a few highlights on regulatory, legal and legislative items. And Carolyn will then close this out with the reiteration of our value proposition. Let's start on Slide 9. On this slide, we're showing our results for the quarter and drivers we're forecasting for the next nine months as we locked our full year guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. For the first quarter, our results came in at $0.29. Versus first quarter last year, you see $0.02 of benefit from lower operating and maintenance costs, partially offset by $0.01 of redeployment. The lower O&M spend is a result of the storms Patti spoke about earlier. With many of our co-workers activated on storm duty, less planned core work was completed during the first quarter of this year. This allowed us to redeploy funds to operational and enterprise programs. This nimble shift in priorities and execution is made possible by the capabilities we're building here at PG&E, enabled by our lean operating system. Finally, you'll see we're calling out $0.02 of other, including some timing items. What you don't see is a meaningful impact directly from the storms. That is because of our long-established CEMA mechanism, which is an important constructive component of California utility regulation. Another driver not reflected explicitly, but to keep in mind, is a benefit from customer capital investment or rate base growth. As you know, a final decision in our 2023 general rate case is expected in the third quarter of this year. Consistent with past cases that Patti described, we will be allowed to record those catch-up revenues for prior quarters once the final decision is received. We're also reiterating our commitment and consistent focus on executing annual 2% non-fuel O&M reductions. I'll remind you that we're planning conservatively and plan to deliver on target, no more, no less, redeploying any excess back into the business for the benefit of our customers. On Slide 10, our customer capital investments have not changed from year-end. We have tremendous opportunities to invest capital into our system for the benefit of customers to advance California's ambitious climate goals and support growing customer demand with the adoption of electric vehicles. This growth benefits our customers and our investors while providing additional cash flow from operations. And our simple, affordable model is how we plan to make this manageable for customers. Moving to Slide 11. In 2022, we exceeded our non-fuel O&M cost reduction target, taking 3% out of the business despite inflation. We use those savings to serve customers and derisk the 2023 plan, which assumes continued inflationary cost pressures. As I mentioned on the year-end call, we see more opportunities for customers ahead, and the team is just getting started in terms of finding cost savings and eliminating waste. Let's move to Slide 12. We believe performance is power. So we intend to continue to deliver on operational commitments serving our customers better and making our systems safer every day. We expect that delivering these results will help us achieve better regulatory and financial outcomes, and California has the regulatory structure in place to help us do just that. Starting at the top of the slide, our 2023 cost of capital is final at 10%. This decision covers the three-year period through 2025, providing certainty for our investors. The cost of capital decision also continues to provide for a trigger mechanism. Should interest rates remain where they are and the mechanism trigger, we would intend to file with the commission for an upward adjustment, consistent with the mechanism. Next is our pending 2023 general rate case. As a reminder, we've already reached resolution on our wildfire self-insurance settlement, saving customers up to $1.8 billion through 2026. Worth noting is that over 85% of our requested revenue requirement increase seeks to mitigate risk in our gas and electric operations and deliver a level of safety that our customers expect and deserve. Our Pacific Generation allocation continues to move through the CPUC process. A final decision is now expected in early 2024 based on the schedule update from the ALJ. We are gearing up to launch the marketing on a parallel path, and we expect to do so this quarter. I'll next cover our pending wildfire-related cost recovery applications. With our 2020 WMCE costs now in rates, the net unresolved balance at the end of the first quarter is approximately $4.8 billion. We've settled our 2021 WMCE, resolving all elements apart from the cost in our Vegetation Management Balancing Account. As Patti mentioned, in the past week, we were pleased to receive a proposed decision recommending that we be granted 100% of the interim rate relief we had requested in our 2022 WMCE application. This amounts to some $1.1 billion over 12 months. This will be a constructive recognition of the importance of timely cash recovery, a key focus for the company. Not only would this outcome reduce financing costs for customers, it would also result in tangible work being executed sooner than would otherwise have been the case, including in the current year. The recently published schedule calls for a final decision in the overall 2022 WMCE application as soon as Q1 of next year. We're advocating for timely resolution in all of our WMCE cases. Resulting cash flow will allow us to accelerate our progress toward improved balance sheet health, improving FFO to debt and providing resources to enable us to meet customer growth demands on the system faster.  It's my pleasure to now hand it over to Carolyn Burke. Thanks, Carolyn. I'd like to say it's been my privilege to serve as CFO here at PG&E and my time in prior roles over the last 11.5 years. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished, and we've built very strong five and 10-year plans. The emphasis now shifts to sound execution, which I have the utmost confidence this team can achieve. I'm also very confident that I'm handing the baton over to a very talented leader who we have shortly come to know as the perfect choice to take PG&E's finance organization through its next chapter.  With that, I'll hand it back to Patti to wrap. No, Anthony, I think it's really a couple of considerations. First, there's a phase 2 piece of this to keep in mind. So the commission is examining both the trigger itself and its treatment as well as an issue rerate, which is the yield spread adjustment in particular. So those are two that will be considered in the phase 2. There's not actually a specific time frame around it.

            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by noting that this will be Chris Foster's last earnings call with PG&E. Thank you, Chris, for your commitment and service to our company over the past 11 years. Since we announced our CFO transition in March, Chris has worked tirelessly to ensure an orderly transition to Carolyn Burke, who will formally take over as our CFO later today. So thank you, Chris, for your friendship, your leadership and your dedication to serving our customers and investors. And a formal welcome to Carolyn, who brings a wealth of financial experience to PG&E as we continue on our journey remaking the company as a top-performing regulated utility. You'll all have opportunities to get to know Carolyn at upcoming events, including at our Investor Day in California later this month. We know you have a lot of calls occurring today. And since we've had a strong quarter, and we'll be seeing many of you in just a couple of weeks, we'll be crisp and to the point. Let's get started. Turning to our results on Slide 3. You'll see we reported first quarter 2023 non-GAAP core earnings of $0.29 per share. This result keeps us on track with our plan for the year. One timing item to consider is our 2023 general rate case. As is common with California GRCs, we have a memo account in place, which will allow for new rates to be implemented retroactive to January 1, meaning that after the final decision is reached, we'd expect to begin recognizing the GRC outcome along with the prior quarter's catch-up. The case schedule calls for a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision in the third quarter. We continue to communicate with all stakeholders to how important it is to have a timely decision in order to have the resources we need to deliver for our customers. Also today, we reaffirm our full year 2023 core EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 10% over 2022. We also reaffirm our previously stated longer-term targets of at least 10% core EPS growth in 2024 and at least 9% for 2025 and 2026. Also unchanged is our plan for no new equity issuance through 2024. As we've said before, we'll work to manage the business through ups and downs like weather, regulatory timing, interest rates and inflation, while delivering the safety and reliability investments that our customers need and the consistent financial results our investors expect. Here on Slide 4, I'll review some of the highlights and proof points as we continue to make progress on mitigating risk, both physical and financial. On wildfire risk mitigation, we filed our 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan at the end of March, which further builds on the layers of protection approach from our 2022 plan. Record winter rains and snowfall have left our hydro assets in a stronger position than they've been in for some years. CEMA, our Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account is one of the constructive features of the California regulatory model. It enables us to focus on serving customers when they need us the most, while we track and defer for future recovery much of the costs associated with these historic weather events. We recorded several hundred million dollars of repair and restoration work to the CEMA account between December and March. Meanwhile, our customer restoration efforts and storm response have been well received in our communities, and our performance benefited from the investments we have made in technology, situational awareness and emergency response coordination. We've also continued to see more constructive policy outcomes, building on last year's passage of legislation supporting our establishment of a 10-year undergrounding plan as well as the state's decision to extend the life of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. Highlights in the first quarter include our wildfire self-insurance plan, which enjoyed unusually strong support from interveners. We were also pleased to receive the Nuclear Regulatory Commission waiver, allowing our two Diablo Canyon nuclear units to continue operating beyond their current license expiration date, while the NRC is considering the renewal applications. We expect to file our applications with the NRC by year-end. And most recently, in the past week, we were encouraged by the proposed decision issued in our 2022 WMCE proceeding. This would grant our full request for $1.1 billion of interim rate relief while allowing for collection over 12 months, also as requested. The PD could be voted out by the CPUC as soon as the June 8 meeting, and we will be advocating for a timely adoption so that customer benefits can be realized. These benefits include millions of dollars in customer financing savings as well as providing cash funding to accelerate investment. This will facilitate us delivering needed safety, reliability and customer connections work. I'm also happy to report on continued progress mitigating financial risk. Our simple, affordable model and deployment of waste elimination, the fifth play of our lean operating system, enables improving the customer experience while keeping us on track to deliver our 2% annual O&M savings in spite of weather and inflation. Also, in support of customer affordability, we worked with the state to offset commodity price increases on winter bills with an acceleration of the annual California Climate Credit. Overall, during the winter gas commodity price run-ups, our procurement team was able to save customers over $1 billion through a series of thoughtful measures including a diversified portfolio that includes interstate pipeline capacity reaching back to the supply basins, natural gas storage and financial hedging. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to estimate that our layers of protection have mitigated over 90% of wildfire risk through the combination of inspection, physical hardening, our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings, Public Safety Power Shutoffs and improved situational awareness and response. While 2022 did not bring the typical high-wind events that would trigger PSPS, we did see an increase of over 30% in high fire risk base given the significant drought conditions. Despite this increased risk, our EPSS program resulted in a reduction of 69% in CPUC reportable admissions, along with 99% fewer acres impacted for EPSS-enabled mines versus the pre-EPSS baseline or 2018 to 2020 average. Our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan builds on these core elements and will also see us deploy additional operational mitigations such as partial voltage detection, which leverages our existing smart meters and our down conductor detection with a plan to install over 1,100 new enabled devices on the system by the end of 2023, translating to over 75% coverage of high fire risk areas. Other programs being expanded for 2023 include our transmission pole clearing, our transmission operational controls, and further measures, including EPS sectionalizing to reduce customer impact. We expect to be sharing more with you on the incremental risk reduction associated with these programs at our Investor Day later in the month. Slide 6 is a reminder of our simple, affordable model, which continues to sit at the heart of our customer value proposition. We remain on track to deliver on at least 2% annual non-fuel O&M reduction with our wildfire self-insurance and incremental vegetation management savings, providing line of sight on continuing to offset inflationary pressures this year. That's a good moment to bring up my story in the month, which has to do with revisiting the way we approach our work, and in this case, in our undergrounding program and how we're eliminating waste in our process. Historically, hitting these internal standards had required our underground electric lines to have at least 36 inches of cover. Upon revisiting this approach and reviewing regulations and the practices of other undergrounding utilities, we determined that 36 inches of cover is not required in most places, and there's little evidence that incrementally deeper conduits are meaningfully safer or more reliable than slightly shallower conduits. Therefore, in Q4 of last year, we revised our standard to only require 30 inches of cover, unless, of course, otherwise directed by permitting authority. While these may not seem like much, this 6-inch change in depth reduces the labor hours required to install our underground conduits and reduces the amount of spoils created during our trenching activities by approximately 17%. We're estimating that this change of 6 inches will save at least $25 million in 2023 alone. That's lower cost for our customers for the same ultimate value, getting our electric distribution lines underground and permanently reducing the risk. This is just the beginning of our waste elimination efforts. We're benchmarking with peers and reviewing where it's appropriate to put the conduits 24 inches deep, another 6 inches of potential savings, and we're analyzing the entire undergrounding delivery process through a value stream mapping exercise to identify further opportunities for efficiency, better customer and co-worker engagement and even more waste elimination. So many practices in large organizations like ours get memorialized and standardized into waste. Our fifth play and our focus on it will unlock value for customers in large and small ways for decades to come. Slide 7 recaps some of the key regulatory and policy catalysts we have in front of us for 2023. The one minor change is for Pacific Generation, where the ALJ recently added about a month to the schedule in response to request for additional time from the interveners. This will likely push the proposed decision from late 2023 into early 2024. And the sooner we get a final decision, the sooner we can bring the expected benefits to our customers. We know there is a lot on the plate at the CPUC at this time. We also know that we want what they want, a safer and more reliable system, which has enabled with timely approval of necessary infrastructure investments. In the meantime, we're improving our processes to make every dollar go further and building the case for the right investments to meet customers' expectations. I'll end here on Slide 8, with our report card reflecting on-track status for all of our operational and financial targets. I'm pleased to say we're on track to deliver on our commitments to both our customers and our investors despite the early challenges from winter storms. We are confident we have built a resilient conservative plan, which is designed to absorb the ups and downs of the business and the markets. As I like to say, we'll ride that roller coaster so you don't have to. And before I hand this over to Chris and Carolyn, I'll leave you with two additional notes on the financial front. First, we look forward to being eligible to reinstate our common dividend later this year, which we view as a key step in our return to financial health and essential for attracting the capital we need to deliver for our customers. As we announced on the year-end call, we expect to hit the required earnings level in the third quarter. Second, we've been encouraged to see the Fire Victim Trust continuing to monetize their stockholding and at growing values. The trust now owns around 6% of our stock, and as of last week, had distributed over $9 billion to their beneficiaries. And now I'll hand it over to Chris for some financial highlights. Thank you again, Chris, and welcome, Carol. In closing, we are solidly on track for another year of consistent performance in 2023. We look forward to sharing more details with you on our progress and our confidence in the outlook at our California Investor Day on May 24 and May 25. While we do have a virtual option for the main slide presentation, for those of you wondering whether to make the trip, there will be a lot more for you to see and experience outside of that webcast window. We'll be showcasing some of our key technology, including wildfire risk reduction, EPSS and undergrounding. We also want to give you a better understanding of why we're confident we can execute our plan, including our 10,000-mile undergrounding program. At our in-person event, you'll also get to hear directly from key California stakeholders, including policymakers, customers and other critical partners as we continue writing the next chapter of the PG&E story. We really hope to see you here in this great state of California at the end of the month. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. It's a great question, Steve. I know a lot of people have been wondering this. So I'll share a couple of things. One, we know that in some ways, the storms were beneficial from the perspective that trees -- aged and dying trees came down and at a time when fire was not a risk. So certainly, that was an advantage. But we also know that the fuels -- the grasses have a rich crop this year. But here's the thing that I want investors to really understand is the mitigations that we've put in place and the technology that we have deployed with EPSS gives us the ability to know in 2-kilometer blocks across our entire service area, what the conditions are real time, whether that's fuel moisture levels, wind conditions, temperatures, et cetera, grass levels, we know our system. And so EPSS puts us in a position to, regardless of weather and regardless of conditions, be prepared and derisk the system. It gives me a lot of confidence heading into wildfire season that we are prepared. Well, I would suggest we are close to the end, Steve. They're less -- well, there are just over a 6% holder today. And in their annual report, they've described their intentions. And we know that it's just less and less of a factor for us, and we're gratified. And I think the agreement worked out well for the beneficiaries as we've been -- as they've been able to sell their shares at an increasing value. So we feel like we've done our part to make it right, which has been a big priority for us. Well, I think we've been really clear with our stakeholders, and I do appreciate that the commission has a lot on their plate, but we all understand, and they want what we want, which is a safe system, which requires investment in the infrastructure. We just continue to reinforce, the timely outcome on the GRC is really important, and we expect that they'll keep to the timing that they've published. Yes. And Shar, this is Patti. I'll just pile on here with Carolyn, our capital allocation decisions are always about investing in the system, making sure that our priority is to make the system safer, faster, meet the needs of our customers. And so we're going to continue to balance that as we factor in the decision about size and pacing of growth. Yes. We're getting excited as we continue to make progress and build out this program. It's such an exciting part of the company, and the team leading it is just doing an incredible job learning new things and getting best practices from across other utilities and getting started. And so we're excited to file that 10-year plan. We expect that the 10-year plan will very much reflect our GRC and the four years that were included in our GRC. And just to remind that, that pending filing shows us doubling our mileage here in 2023 getting to 350 miles, ramping up to 450 miles in 2024, 550 miles in 2026 and then 750 miles in 2026 -- 550 miles, sorry, in 2025 and 750 miles in 2026. That ramp will be consistent with what we filed in our 10-year plan. And so based on the timing of that 10-year plan, we are waiting on feedback from OEIS on when they will receive that plan. We're ready to file that when they are ready to receive it. They're staffing up so that they can receive it. But I do think it's important for people to know that the first four years, including this year -- or the next four years, including this year, are reflected already in our GRC, including, obviously, the cost recovery associated with that. And so depending on the timing of the OEIS' availability to receive our 10-year plan has little bearing on the initial years of our undergrounding program. Well, Julien, we take great pride in giving you multiple years' forward expectations on earnings. I would suggest that there are some -- especially with the GRC coming out late after Investor Day that it's unlikely that we'll forecast any further than 2026, but we're pretty proud of the fact that we're giving you guidance through 2026. Anthony, that's a great question. And first of all, I do remind people that all the time that we've been burying pipe for a long time. However, I would say the synergies that exist are that we can deploy our workforce. We actually have a program called GTE, gas to electric, where we're enabling our gas workforce to do a lot of the civil work. All that to say, this undergrounding of electric lines has new technologies that we can deploy today that we're pretty excited about. And you'll get a chance to see those at our Investor Day, the actual equipment, whether it's a rock wheel or a plow-type piece of equipment or even at grade conduit in what's something called K rail, which we'll be able to show you all these things at Investor Day. There's still much, much efficiency that we can gain, and we're really excited about all of the progress and the ideas that we're getting both from our partners as well as from our own work team in our gas division. So there's definitely a great synergy there to leverage. Yes. Well, the scale is really massive, Ryan. It starts -- I think the book ends of the mailing, which is $4 million of potential savings with just 1 mailing, all the way up to the story that I shared about the undergrounding, that's all borne out of waste elimination. Some other important focus areas for us in the waste elimination center are things like our new customer connection process improvement. I know that's an area of interest for a lot of people, and we've been making significant progress there in identifying waste in that process that we can eliminate and make a better outcome, a faster outcome for customers at a lower cost as well as other things like just bundling work. We have work often done in silos. So on one week, a crew might go out and change a cross arm and two weeks later, they might go out and change that very same pole. And so bundling work so that we get out there once and do it at the lowest cost possible and least disruptive for customers. The potential here, Ryan, I cannot describe is almost infinite. And when we get 26,000 of my co-workers all being proficient in being able to see waste for what it is and then eliminate it on a daily basis, this thing just runs itself. That's a -- it's a great future that lies ahead for this team and therefore, our customers. Thanks, Audra. And we really wanted to be mindful of everyone's time today and keeping this call short. So I'll just wrap with one -- couple of thoughts. One, our best wishes to Chris as he embarks on his next professional step. We're going to miss him, but we're excited and proud of everything that he's achieved and what he's going to achieve next. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Days on May 24 and 25. We're excited to see that many of you have already registered, high demand for this event. So we're excited about that. There will be much for you to see live. It will not be possible on the webcast. And so we still have room, if you'd just like to join us, just make sure you register. We are definitely seeing progress here at PG&E. And we want to be able to share that with you at our Investor Day. We want you to know that an investment in PCG is an investment in serving people, the planet and prosperity of many millions. And we're very proud of the progress that the team is making here. I want to share that with you at Investor Day. So we look forward to seeing you there. Please be safe out there, everyone. Have a great day."

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Arnold. You may now begin.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are Patty Poppe, Chief Executive Officer, and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial result are described on the second page of today's earnings presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides, along with other relevant information, can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We'd also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. And with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patty Poppe.\nPatty Poppe: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. We've seen another quarter of solid progress, and I'm pleased to share our third quarter results and some updates to our guidance and financial plan. Our core earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.37, bringing up to $1.06 for the first nine months. We're narrowing our 2024 guidance range, lifting the low end by $0.01 and firming up our 10% growth over 2023 at the midpoint. Our 2024 range is now $1.34 to $1.37. Reflecting growth in current customer demand, we're also adding $1 billion to our five-year capital plan, which is now $63 billion through 2028. Previously, we said we'd grow earnings per share at least 9% in 2025. With this additional capital, we're now raising 2025 guidance from 9% to 10%. And we're initiating our formal 2025 EPS guidance range of $1.47 to $1.51. In addition, we're reaffirming our longer term earnings per share growth of at least 9% in 2026, 2027 and 2028, and that's now from our new 2025 guidance midpoint. We remain firm in our commitment to no new equity in 2024. Our equity guidance of $3 billion from 2025 through 2028 is also unchanged. We still expect this to be issued ratably over the period, likely through a routine utility at the market or ATM program. What you're seeing in these numbers is growing customer demand for electrification in California, from housing developments to electric vehicle charging stations, data centers, commercial projects and local infrastructure. Much of this is beneficial load growth, meaning it will help us achieve our affordability goals once completed. Consistent with what we've told you, we're able to add this new capital to the plan because it meets our criteria. One, it's been approved by regulators. Two, it's affordable for customers. Three, it's beneficial for investors, meaning accretive to EPS. And four, we were able to finance it efficiently with our recent holdco offering of junior subordinated notes. This is the same disciplined approach you can expect from us going forward. Moving to Slide 4 and our power pyramid. Let me reiterate that it all starts with safety. Our layers of physical and financial protections are working as intended. Our simple, affordable model is how we can make critical infrastructure investments affordable for our customers. And building on these first 2 layers, we intend to deliver a growing and decarbonized energy future in California. As you know, our stand here at PG&E is that catastrophic wildfires shall stop. We are laser focused on doing just that every day. And days like tomorrow, which is the anniversary of the 2018 camp fire further reinforce what's at stake. Our strategy starts with understanding the risk each and every day. We innovate and implement layers of operational protection. We operate with a mindset of continuous improvement, keeping safety at the heart of every decision. We leverage our technology to partner with first responders to speed up and improve response to admission from any source. And we advocate for climate resilience, long-term infrastructure solutions such as undergrounding the highest-risk miles on our system, all of which create a fundamentally safer California for citizens and investors. Wildfire risk was elevated this year, and the ignition count is up as a result. As shown here on Slide 5, the ignition rate in high fire-threat areas under R3 plus [ph] conditions is standing at 1.44 for the rolling 12 months through November 4. This is notably lower than 2017 and 2018, demonstrating that even under higher risk conditions, California is safer. Incidents affecting 10 acres or more for California, predominantly nonutility cost ignitions, have also increased more than threefold this year versus 2023, given the more challenging weather conditions. Despite this backdrop, here's the metric that matters, a multiyear trend of no major fires due to PG&E equipment. While we're never satisfied, this summer was one more proof point that our physical risk mitigations are working. While our operational mitigations have proven effective, they do come with a reliability trade-off. That's why we continue to believe that strategic undergrounding in the highest risk locations is the right solution for our service territory. Turning to Slide 6. Related to the Dixie Fire. We were pleased to share last month that the state Wildfire Fund has paid our first set of claims for $39 million. Our second monthly request for $34 million was paid out on October 28, and we intend to continue submitting our claims on a monthly cadence going forward. This is another proof point of Assembly Bill 1054 working as designed. As you know, we're also working every day to execute on our simple, affordable model shown here on Slide 7. The simple affordable model is how we plan to keep customer build growth at or below assumed inflation, as we continue to invest in critical infrastructure. This is a proven winning model supported by our lean operating system and bolstered by California's leadership in the transition to clean energy. We have a strong existing plan, as shown here on the left. And as we announced today, we're pulling some additional capital into the plan to better serve our customers, while maintaining balance sheet health. We continue to see opportunities for further amplification through incremental O&M reductions and electric load growth. We're working each element of this model every day with no big best approach, as Carolyn will discuss. But first, let's dive deeper into the PG&E performance playbook in action as we turn to Slide 8 and my story of the month. Our Dublin Innovation Center was created to drive better outcomes for our customers. Last quarter, I shared how one team was reinventing the inspection process, identifying the right work, completing it 50% faster than our previous standard and delivering cost savings, which we look forward to passing along to customers in our next rate case. With the incremental energization capital spend top of mind, I thought I'd share how our service planning and design team is using our performance playbook to rapidly implement regulatory decisions and deliver for our customers. Following the CPUC approval of our initial SB410 energization filing and an incremental $1 billion of funding, the team immediately mobilized. Looking across a number of factors, including customer readiness, permitting agency timelines and materials availability, the team quickly identified over 3,000 incremental customer requests that can be completed this year. The team is also implementing process improvements that lead to labor and cost savings to our customers. For example, we reimagined the application process, which we estimate will reduce our customer cancellation rate by 70%. And we updated the job package preparation and estimating standards, cutting processing time for electric design work by 40%. These are classic examples of waste and rework that we're eliminating to the benefit of customers. I could not be prouder of this and all the other examples I see of coworkers using the tools of our performance playbook to cause better outcomes for our customers and predictable growth for our investors. With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn.\nCarolyn Burke: Thank you, Patty and good morning everyone. Today, I'm looking forward to covering three main topics with you. First, our results for the first nine months of 2024; second, our growing capital plan and strong financing plan; and third, how we continue to execute against our simple, affordable model. As you know, performance is power. And our path to investment-grade and constructive regulatory outcomes depends on consistently delivering against our targets. Starting here on Slide 9, we are showing you our earnings growth [ph]. For the first nine months through September, our core earnings of $1.06 are up $0.30 over the same period last year. Remember that last year, our general rate case was not approved until the fourth quarter, and that is when we booked the revenue catch-up for all of 2023. Adjusting the first nine months of 2023 for the GRC timing, our results were up $0.19 year-over-year. The main driver of our year-over-year increase continues to be higher customer capital investment, including the change in ROE from 10% in 2023 to 10.7% for 2024. We continue to drive nonfuel O&M savings throughout the business. This performance is contributing four sets to our results and [Indiscernible] achieved for various programs such as profit improvement per inspection as well as lower contract spend new strategic sourcing. We also remain committed to reinvesting new savings and the orderly upside back into the business to support incremental customer investment. This drove $0.07 of redeployment, including into programs which support risk mitigation, such as conversion maintenance and emergency preparedness and response. As a reminder, we redeploy as a way to derisk future years and deliver consistent performance year-in and year-out. Turning to Slide 10. As you saw earlier, these pulled an incremental $1 billion of CapEx into our five-year plan as a result of the SB410 funding for new energization projects approved during the third quarter. This increases the five-year compound growth in our rate base from 9.5% to 10%. Our share of rate base already authorized picks up to 93% in 2026, including the additional $1 billion for energization spend and $900 million accrued for our Open General Office. Also, we are still signaling an incremental at least $5 billion of additional customer investment opportunities. There is no shortage for customer beneficial work on our transmission and distribution systems. And even after pulling in $8 billion of capital, we still see at least $5 billion in potential. I'll remind you that incremental transmission work would fall under our FERC formula rate. Back in July, the CPUC issued a decision in the second phase of our general rate case, implementing provisions of Senate Bill 410. The commission encouraged us to request incremental funding for 2025 and 2026, if necessary to address customer energization needs. In response to the demand, we're seeing from customers, we filed a supplemental request on October 4, proposing to add $3.1 billion of work for 2025 and 2026. Including timing adjustments, this would amount to a further net addition of $2.8 billion. This represents another proof point of the growing revenue demand we see in California, and we stand ready to serve this demand. The commissions and [indiscernible] and will call for a proposed decision in the first quarter of 2025. Once we have the final decision, we will expect implications both for our workplace and for our financing. As I discussed last quarter, we'll make this devaluation in context of our financial guide posts, namely the incremental capital investments must be beneficial and affordable for customers, accretive to earnings per share and also helpful to our balance sheet. Here on slide 11, you can see that our updated five-year financial plan now reflects $63 billion of CapEx over the period. Of note, no change to our dividend and equity component, no change to our commitment to reduce $2 billion of corporate debt by the end of 2026 and no change to flexibility that we built into this plan. Our updated financing plan continues our commitment to achieving investment-grade ratings and prioritizing customer capital investment. On the slide, you'll see the comparisons plan that we shared with you on our second quarter earnings call. We've increased utility long-term debt issuance and the corporate debt hybrid and other bucket, each by $0.5 billion. These changes reflect the impact of the $1 billion in junior subordinated notes issued in September. I'll remind you that the JSM received 50% equity credit from S&P and Fitch and are an example of our commitment to pursuing the most efficient financing possible. Proceeds to mid hybrid instruments were used in part to pay down $500 million on our term loan base, resulting in a transaction that is neutral to credit rate metrics. The remaining $500 million of JSM proceeds will fund the equity portion of the capital addition to this plan. Lastly, our plan still calls for $3 billion of equity from 2025 to 2028, which we expect to issue on a ratable basis under a normal utility ATM program. This amount is easily achievable for a utility of our size and is in line with many of our industry peers who also utilize ATM program. As we've indicated before, this equity need is already factored into our multiyear earnings per share guidance of at least 10%, now extended through 2025, and at least 9% each year in 2026, 2027 to 2028. Turning to slide 12. As Patty mentioned, our simple affordable model assumes a no-fee-based approach and we are laser focused on executing it every day to make our industry-leading capital growth affordable for all our customers. Here's why I consider this, a no big bets model and why we see further opportunities for amplification. First, in terms of O&M cost savings. We are currently working nearly 200 initiatives to reduce material contracts and other costs to more efficiently plan, execute and automate our work. Our statements are not dependent on any one initiative, as we are reducing waste across the enterprise. We have ample runway to improve our capital to expense ratio, such as reducing annual repairs or ongoing true trend and placing these activities with durable, long-lasting capital improvement, which also benefit customer rates. And we exceeded our O&M reduction goal two years in a row, reducing operating and maintenance expense by 3% in 2022 and 5.5% in 2023. These projects fuel the excitement and momentum you can feel, whether you're out in the field, at our Dublin Innovation Center, or in one of our command centers here in Oakland. We is a way of thinking that is grounded and improving customer experiences at a lower cost. We're proving out the philosophy that this philosophy is well placed at PG&E and is delivering meaningful results. With year-end insight, I'm confident that in 2024, we will meet or exceed our 2% target. Second, load growth. Our load growth will come from electric vehicles, data centers and building electrification. It's not dependent on one mega customer or a project. And state policy and decarbonization goals are driving increased electrification. I'm also excited about the innovations taking place that will help us leverage new load in ways beneficial to the grid. Take, for example, our partnership with the Open School District and Zoom to deploy the nation's the largest bidirectional electric school bus fleet. This EV fleet is equipped with groundbreaking vehicle-to-grid technology, enabling the buses to return annually but the two or more gigawatt hours of energy back to the grid when not in use. Lastly, efficient financing. In addition to our recent convertible and JSN financing, Future opportunities could include other hybrids, DOE loan and grant programs, working capital improvement and credit rating upgrades. Turning to Slide 14. In terms of credit rating, I'll remind you that we're just one notch below investment grade at both Moody's and Fitch and on positive outlook at both. With our strong performance, especially through this challenging fire season, we continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our layers of physical risk mitigation. Coupled with improving financial metrics and maintained strong governance, we see a near-term path to achieving investment-grade credit at the parent company. Growing cash flows drive balance sheet help supports our credit rating improvement and in turn, will help to make our critical customer investment affordable. As you can see here on Slide 15, we grew our operating cash flow by $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. And we're in course to deliver over $3 billion more operating cash flow for the full year, consistent with prior forecasts. Of course, the GRC is a key driver of this improvement, as well as the interim rate release we've seen from the CPUC in our 2022 WMCE and the 2023 WGSD applications. Turning to Slide 16. We continue to work well with policymakers and stakeholders. We saw constructive final decisions in our first SB 410 Signed, our open headquarter purchase and our request for interim rate relief for our 2023 WMCE, all in the third quarter. I\u2019ll end here on Slide 17 with a reminder of our value proposition. It's one fueled by differentiated performance, a constructive operating environment and placing the customer at the heart of everything we do. And it's allowing us to deliver 10% rate base growth through 2028, at least 10% core EPS growth in 2024 and now through 2025 and at least 9% core EPS growth each year from 2026 through 2028. With that, I'll hand it back to Patty.\nPatty Poppe: Thank you, Carolyn. I'm excited about our differentiated story here at PG&E. Our power pyramid is the path forward. It starts with the foundation of physical and financial safety. That foundation gives us permission to focus on our simple, affordable model. When we saw you in New York in June, we talked about our model and how it can be amplified. Today is another step towards that being realized. Ultimately, we share California's aspiration for growth and a decarbonized economy at a lower societal cost. We are proud to be leading the way and delivering results for our customers and for you, our investors. We're looking forward to seeing you in just a couple of days at EEI. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: We are now opening the floor for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys, good morning.\nCarolyn Burke: Hey, Shar.\nPatty Poppe: Good morning.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. Obviously, congrats on the quarter. Just starting on the incremental CapEx, $1 billion is obviously accretive to plan. Was that the core driver of the 10% EPS growth as implied by the 2025 guidance? And how should we think about the level of CapEx upside in the context of the improved customer connection cost caps? Is there more to come as you fully utilize that construct?\nCarolyn Burke: Yeah, Shar, great question. The $1 billion definitely was the key driver for our increase to 10%. This is this disciplined approach we're talking about to make sure that we get the CapEx approved. It's affordable for customers. It's accretive to EPS. and then we can finance it efficiently. So we were able to meet all of our criteria in this case. And so as we look at the next phase of our filing, the supplemental SB 410, we see that we're going to need additional funding to keep up with customer demand. And so that's great news, I think, for California. I think it's great news for our customers. And so that's why we filed the supplemental. We won't build that into the plan until we know we meet our criteria of our disciplined approach, however. But I do think that bodes well for both customers and investors.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then you noted there's no incremental equity needs from the new CapEx in part junior subordinated funded. Are there any other embedded assumptions around timing of future equity or dividend that helps you absorb the $1 billion of new CapEx? And how do you offset the $1 billion of CapEx with no equity? And does it sort of -- does it do anything to the IG timing? I don't get a sense it does, but just curious.\nCarolyn Burke: No, it doesn't. So the $1 billion of additional CapEx was funded. That was funded by the junior subordinated notes. That was a $1 billion issue. And so that was a very efficient financing. It had 50% equity content. We were pleased to the response to that. I will say -- I'll just remind you, yes, we had no changes -- no further changes to our equity plan in our financing plan. We're still looking at issuing a routine ATM program next year and over the five-year plan, it's in total of $3 billion. And again, no new equity in 2024.\nShar Pourreza : Fantastic, guys. Congrats, and see you in a couple of days. I appreciate it.\nPatty Poppe: Awesome. Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Your line is now open.\nSteve Fleishman : Yes. Hi. Good morning.\nPatty Poppe: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman : Hi. Just Governor Newsom's, I guess, executive order on affordability initiatives. Just -- could you talk to, I guess, your thoughts on that? And the things I know you've got the simple affordable model, so you're obviously addressing it, but just maybe some perspective related to your plan?\nPatty Poppe : Yes. Steve, we definitely want what the Governor wants and what our policymakers want, and that's affordable energy for the people of California. And really, you answered the question for me by mentioning our simple affordable model. That is the pathway. And I think as the state starts to see us truly implementing and delivering those savings, especially when we talk about our rate case that we'll be filing next year for 2027, we'll be able to show the impact of the simple affordable model through that filing. And so we do look forward to helping earn the -- well, to earn the trust of the regulators and our policymakers in this process. But also give them good ideas about what can really drive affordability here in California. I think the idea that we can continue to reduce our cost and grow load. I think the growing load is something that is a big change here. And I think that's going to be exciting and welcome news to our policymakers when they truly understand what the implications are for customer affordability as we invest in the infrastructure to grow load here in California.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay. And then one other question. You mentioned one source of funding being DOE loans potentially. Just any thoughts on how the election outcome might impact that, if at all?\nPatty Poppe: Yes. Unfortunately, it's a very confidential process. So I can't say much about it, Steve. But obviously, there's still time before the year-end for a resolution on the DOE funding and DOE loan. The thing that we like about the DOE loan is it's just net-net savings for customers. However, we've not built our financial plan assuming anything associated with that. That would be upside and accretive to the plan.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thank you.\nPatty Poppe : Yes, you're welcome. Have a great day, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities LLC. Your line is now open.\nRich Sunderland : It's actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Can you hear me?\nPatty Poppe.: Hi, Rich. We can hear you. Yes.\nRich Sunderland: Great, thank you. I'm curious, where things stand on the undergrounding guidelines, you're approach to finalization. What are the next steps there after for harmonizing your plan to those guidelines once that process is completed? Thank you.\nPatty Poppe : Yes, great question. We continue to work with OEIS to understand and establish what those filing requirements will be. To-date, they've been more extensive than we expected. And so our filing will -- if the current guidelines as published are the final guidelines, that could very much delay our filing, but we are hopeful to make that undergrounding filing by mid-next year. We continue to stand that in our highest risk areas, undergrounding is the right solution. It's not all our miles, but it is definitely our highest risk miles. And so we do believe that, as directed by the legislature that this undergrounding filing will be able to demonstrate the longer-term cost benefit savings for customers. We know that it is the most affordable way to make our customers safe and to have them not have to choose between having reliability and being safe. And so we look forward to making that filing. We'll continue to work with the OEIS, but I expect our filing will be mid-2025 likely at the earliest.\nRich Sunderland: Great. Thank you. Very helpful. And then picking up the energization conversation, how are you thinking about ramping that work and clearing the backlog? Curious if it simply comes down to, I guess, what the CPUC authorizes in your supplemental request? Any other thoughts there?\nPatty Poppe: Yes, that obviously is a big driver. It does cost something to do the work. It's not free. And so the proposal -- the filing that we made reflects actual customer demand to both clear any kind of backlog but also to maintain the growth rate that we're seeing. We're seeing about a 10% year-over-year growth rate in new customer connection requests, which is exciting news. I mean, I just think it really bodes well for California. And so we want to fulfill that demand. And the good news is much of that demand can be fulfilled at a continually improving unit cost, which we'll be driving for by improving how we do our work, the way we contract for that work, the way we schedule and bundle that work. All of those process improvements we've been making will be beneficial to customers, but that's fully reflected in the filing that we made, and we look forward to being able to continue to fulfill our customers' expectations as the commission has their role to play in going ahead and approving that important investment in our customers' expectations.\nRich Sunderland: Great. Thanks for the time. And see you all soon.\nPatty Poppe: Yeah, great. Thanks, Rich\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning team. How you guys all doing.\nPatty Poppe: Good morning.\nCarolyn Burke: Thanks Julien. How you doing?\nQ \u2013 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Good afternoon -- Just moving back to where -- how Rich was a second to go here on the OEIS side. I mean, we saw SDG&E get fairly, at least in a proposed decision, get a fairly de minimis number. Can you speak to that a little bit? I mean, what do you read out of that? I mean, obviously, your service starts a little different here, but anything to note out of that, again, as you plan towards mid next year's filing here, if you will?\nPatty Poppe: Yes. Keep in mind, that was their GRC. We're talking about our undergrounding filing, which is based on the new legislation that was passed about a 10-year filing. So two different things. I will say, at a minimum, we have the undergrounding that's been approved in our GRC, which was a total of 1,200 miles, and we are on track to continue to build those miles through 2026. So we have undergrounding in our plan through 2026. The OEIS filing that we'll be making will be supplemental, obviously, to that and longer term. So I do think that here in California, we do need to understand -- and I do think there's a lot of misinformation that's being spread about the cost effectiveness of undergrounding. And we very much believe in the certain conditions, it is the right mitigation. And it is the most cost-effective mitigation. People are forgetting how much we spend on tree trimming and overhead inspections year after year after year. So, for example, in customers' bills today, in our customers' bills, we spend about $1 a month on undergrounding, and we spend $20 a month for vegetation management and inspections. Customers don't understand that. And honestly, I think some of the policy decision makers -- and certainly, the interveners clearly do not understand the actual math. And so we're going to continue to try and make that math clear that, it is in the best interest of customers, not just for safety and reliability, but affordability for undergrounding in our highest risk miles. So we continue to advocate and we will continue to do that and try and make the case.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. No, I thought SDG&E got like 6% of the miles in the PD. But actually adjacent here, just last quarter, we talked about this 3.5 gigawatt data center pipeline, right? And you spoke about potentially a sizable chunk of that being related to one counterparty here. Where are you on that pipeline and moving forward and maybe diversifying it out, if you will?\nPatty Poppe: Yeah. Let me clarify that, Julien. We definitely -- we're completing our first cluster study. We should be communicating with those customers here by December, and it was a much more efficient way to study the interconnection of all of this new demand. And it was multiple customers and multiple projects adding up to an initial request of 3.5 gigawatts. Keeping in mind, we only had a couple of hundred megawatts in our plan to begin with. So the 3.5 gigawatts was a nice increase, but that's not been our last request, to be clear. That was just what was in this cluster study. And I feel like the most popular girl in school these days, that I get a call every week about some other projects, somebody wants us to squeeze into our plan and our study. And so one of the things, Julien, that I think about for California and for PG&E specifically, being here in the Bay Area, the demand for being -- having access to this fiber network that's here in the hub that's in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, the demand is real. They thought that we were out of power. And we have been able to confirm that we actually have significant capacity available on our system. We've added both generation and transmission capacity here in California. On the generation side, we added just last year, 9.5 gigawatts of new supply. In California, 10 gigawatts of supply now is battery storage. That really is a great complement to our excess solar that we have midday. So we are open for business in California. I kind of think of us as like the perfect mix, like you can have too much demand that's too expensive to supply, and you can have too little so you don't get the benefit of load growth. I put us right there in the sweet spot, the Goldilocks of load growth is here at PG&E. We have just the right amount that we can fund that's affordable for customers. And I'm excited to build that and we're excited to be able to deliver for these customers who are more and more interested by the day.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. I like the Goldilocks. Good luck, we'll see you shortly.\nPatty Poppe: Thanks, Julien.\nCarolyn Burke: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gregg Orrill from UBS. Your line is now open.\nGregg Orrill: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Thank you.\nPatty Poppe: Hi, Gregg.\nCarolyn Burke: Hi, Gregg.\nGregg Orrill: Hi. Could you just update us on where you stand with FFO to debt and how that positions you with the agencies?\nCarolyn Burke: Sure. So we don't normally give intra-year updates, but there is no change to our outlook, which is the mid-teens. What I'll point you to is our operating cash flow, which is absolutely on track to increase $3 billion over 2023 to $8 billion in 2024. And we still see it growing after 2024. Sitting here on November 7, I'm feeling confident that by year-end, we'll be at or very close to that mid-teens guidance that we've put out there, showing significant improvements over 2023.\nGregg Orrill: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCarly Davenport: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the prior question. Just -- as you think about moving through another wildfire season here, are there any updates you can share in terms of your recent conversations with the agencies on what they're focusing on with that kind of risk aspect?\nPatty Poppe: Well, I think the real focus is just what do we need to do to make the system safer, faster. I think we have shown that our current mitigations are working. And this is the case that we really want to make sure is clear. There is no doubt that the conditions here in California are at a heightened risk level this year. And we're seeing that in the number of 10-acre fires caused by any number of things, predominantly non-utility caused fires. But 10-acre fires across California are way up this year. And understanding that and looking at how effective our mitigations have been is a real conversation that we're having, and people are really starting to see that. The disadvantage of these mitigations -- so when I'm talking about these mitigations, I'm talking about our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings, and I'm talking about the Public Safety Power Shutoffs, which we are continuing to shrink their scope and get them very targeted and restore customers as quickly, as safely possible. And all of that is good, but it's still an outage. And so I think the conversation is, what is an acceptable amount of outage given the risk. So we know that there's only one mitigation that eliminates the risk of both a Public Safety Power Shutoff and a wildfire, and that's undergrounding, which is why we're so bullish on that. However, I think we're also seeing that there are certainly miles and miles. And we've done 1,000 miles already of covered conductor. We think that's important in certain areas that aren't so tree-dense and making sure that we do the right inspections and the right evaluations of the safety of our equipment. So, I would say our discussions with our safety regulators and our financial regulators are very constructive. And they are very complementary of the progress we've made. And there's no doubt that across the state, people feel the change. And we're very proud of our multiyear trend here of no major fires and 2 years specifically with limited to no structural damage. That's the real test of our system and our safety measures. So just real progress. And I think people feel that. I think the healthy debate about what's the right mitigation for the long run, what's the right infrastructure, fit for purpose for the long run, that conversation continues, and we need to keep educating and advocating for the right work for our customers.\nCarolyn Burke: Yes. And Carly, I'll just -- to be clear, we remain absolutely intently focused on improving our credit quality, and we have ongoing conversations with the rating agencies. As we've noted, we're just one notch below investment grade at Moody's. They've been pretty clear that we are already meeting their financial metrics, and we're looking at our performance through another wildfire season. This season was particularly challenging. And as we've noted on the call today, our performance was -- I don't want to her say -- .\nPatty Poppe: It was good.\nCarolyn Burke: Very strong. And I think Moody's is going to see that. We're on an annual cycle with Moody's. We're on positive outlook with them, and we're looking forward to having conversations with them and we're optimistic.\nCarly Davenport: That's super helpful. Thank you for that. And then maybe shifting gears a little bit. Just as we think about the $5 billion of incremental investments you've highlighted in the context of the changes you've announced today related to the $1 billion of capital. Just how would you frame out the potential around rate base and earnings growth over that 26 plus 2026 to 2028 kind of time frame?\nCarolyn Burke: When we're looking at the -- your question around the timing, but around the $5 billion and when we would expect to bring that in. So maybe I'll just start with the latter point. As we did say, we do have an additional $5 billion of incremental capital that we could bring into our plan. As Patty indicated, it needs to be authorized. I call it the 4As for everybody. This way, you'll remember it. It has to be authorized. It has to be affordable for our customers, has to be accretive to our earnings and we have to be able to finance it efficiently for our balance sheet. So when we think about that, we've already talked about seeing an outcome of the SB 410 supplemental sometime in the first half of 2025. And so we would -- as long as we see a positive outcome then, we would look at it to ensure the guidelines and roll that in. There's additional -- in the pipeline, as we look at that $5 billion, there's additional transmission capacity build out. We talked about the data centers, and we're seeing more requests there. We have some IT improvements that we're looking at. And then there's just the additional work in both generation and our hydros and EV-related capital. So all of that would be brought in. And as we said, over the course of five-year plan as it meets our criteria. But we have a very robust pipeline. I'll just note, we brought in $1 billion this quarter, and yet we didn't change the $5 billion. We didn't put that $5 billion of potential down to $4 billion. We kept it at $5 billion. We have a very robust pipeline.\nCarly Davenport: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDavid Arcaro: Good morning. Thanks so much. I had a follow-up on a prior question, just on the executive order related to affordability. One of the maybe topics that was mentioned or called out was Wildfire Safety programs. And I'm just wondering how you -- you've mentioned a lot about -- especially how effective they've been so far for sure. But is there an approach there that you might consider fat to cut in certain programs or any kind of affordability perspectives that you add to that program?\nPatty Poppe: I think the bigger question is, do we have alignment between the safety regulator and the financial regulator on scope and cost and what's most effective. And I think that's really what's being discussed is how do we streamline the process of getting a safety regulation signed off on and then how does that feed into the financial approvals. And so I think it's more processed than specific mitigations that are being discussed.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Okay. Thanks. Understood.\nPatty Poppe: Yeah.\nDavid Arcaro: Then on the financial side, I was wondering, would you expect the plan going forward to be rebasing EPS off of actual numbers as you finish up years?\nCarolyn Burke: Absolutely.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Perfect. Clear enough. Thanks so much.\nCarolyn Burke: Great. Thanks David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Lonegan from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lonegan: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You spoke about\u2026\nCarolyn Burke: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Lonegan: Good morning. You spoke about sources of efficient financing, highlighted various categories. I think you said other hybrid, DOE loan and grant programs, working capital improvements and credit rating upgrades. So you left out potential asset sales. Just wondering if that's something you've ruled out for now. And if not, what you could monetize? And given that Pac Gen was rejected, what would give you confidence in approvals going forward?\nCarolyn Burke: Yeah, Michael, asset sales has not been on the list. It's not -- we've seen -- we've done the sale of the towers in the past. Pac Gen is definitely not something we're moving forward with. So we don't really see that as a primary source of efficient financing in the future.\nMichael Lonegan: Got it. Great. Thanks. And then secondly, you continue to highlight the opportunity set in months and years to come that you reiterated today for the higher non-fuel O&M reductions, increased load growth, lower customer bills. Just wondering if you could share your latest thoughts on the timeline when we could expect some of that to roll into your formal plan?\nPatty Poppe: Well, we just rolled in $1 billion of it. So we'll be looking forward then to the next -- over the next year when the right time to meet Carolyn's 4A, as she called them. That 4As is good disciplined business. And that's -- I think this is just such an important takeaway for this call today. So thanks for reiterating it. PG&E is in a position where we have demand, and we have a disciplined path forward. We have the ability to finance our work. We have the ability to grow our business. We have the ability to better serve our customers. And given a variety of conditions all around us, I'm so proud of the progress that the team has made to truly move forward with growth, industry-leading. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to continue to be disciplined in how we do that for the benefit of customers and consistent financial results for you.\nMichael Lonegan: Great, thanks. I was referring to the -- like the O&M reduction, like the one to three to the two to four. And then the electric load growth going up and the customer bill, is going down that \"opportunity\" versus the formal plan. I was wondering when we could expect to see that potentially enter your formal plan.\nPatty Poppe: Yeah. So you're seeing some of that -- as we speak. Now, the O&M reductions will be reflected in our GRC filing, because that's how we pass those through to customers directly. So you'll see that then. We definitely are trying to signal here today that we see that amplified simple affordable model materializing. So we started with the capital rate base growth that we've grown here. We're seeing the O&M savings internally. In fact, just yesterday -- or earlier this week, I was in our Waste Elimination Center. And I have to tell you, if I could bottle up that enthusiasm that our team is demonstrating actual joy at work and improving how our business is operated. Carolyn mentioned over 200 projects that are being implemented. There was a total of 500 projects that were also, really looked at across all different types of improvements, some of them directly related to O&M, some related to other things. But the team is learning how to transform this business. So we definitely see the amplified simple, affordable model being realized in the next \u2013 near-term as we're able to pass along those savings and reflect then this load growth in our forecast for our next GRC as well. So that's really the mechanism that we have to pass those along to customers.\nMichael Lonegan: Great. Thanks for the time. See you soon.\nPatty Poppe: Thank you.\nCarolyn Burke: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: We've reached the end of our time. I'd now like to hand back over to Patty Poppe, for further remarks.\nPatty Poppe: Thank you, Eli. Well, everyone, we appreciate you joining us today. And we appreciate your ongoing support. We really feel the momentum. PG&E is delivering the right kind of progress at the right time. And we hope you feel that, too. And we look forward to seeing you at EEI. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. We've seen another quarter of solid progress, and I'm pleased to share our third quarter results and some updates to our guidance and financial plan. Our core earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.37, bringing up to $1.06 for the first nine months. We're narrowing our 2024 guidance range, lifting the low end by $0.01 and firming up our 10% growth over 2023 at the midpoint. Our 2024 range is now $1.34 to $1.37. Reflecting growth in current customer demand, we're also adding $1 billion to our five-year capital plan, which is now $63 billion through 2028. Previously, we said we'd grow earnings per share at least 9% in 2025. With this additional capital, we're now raising 2025 guidance from 9% to 10%. And we're initiating our formal 2025 EPS guidance range of $1.47 to $1.51. In addition, we're reaffirming our longer term earnings per share growth of at least 9% in 2026, 2027 and 2028, and that's now from our new 2025 guidance midpoint. We remain firm in our commitment to no new equity in 2024. Our equity guidance of $3 billion from 2025 through 2028 is also unchanged. We still expect this to be issued ratably over the period, likely through a routine utility at the market or ATM program. What you're seeing in these numbers is growing customer demand for electrification in California, from housing developments to electric vehicle charging stations, data centers, commercial projects and local infrastructure. Much of this is beneficial load growth, meaning it will help us achieve our affordability goals once completed. Consistent with what we've told you, we're able to add this new capital to the plan because it meets our criteria. One, it's been approved by regulators. Two, it's affordable for customers. Three, it's beneficial for investors, meaning accretive to EPS. And four, we were able to finance it efficiently with our recent holdco offering of junior subordinated notes. This is the same disciplined approach you can expect from us going forward. Moving to Slide 4 and our power pyramid. Let me reiterate that it all starts with safety. Our layers of physical and financial protections are working as intended. Our simple, affordable model is how we can make critical infrastructure investments affordable for our customers. And building on these first 2 layers, we intend to deliver a growing and decarbonized energy future in California. As you know, our stand here at PG&E is that catastrophic wildfires shall stop. We are laser focused on doing just that every day. And days like tomorrow, which is the anniversary of the 2018 camp fire further reinforce what's at stake. Our strategy starts with understanding the risk each and every day. We innovate and implement layers of operational protection. We operate with a mindset of continuous improvement, keeping safety at the heart of every decision. We leverage our technology to partner with first responders to speed up and improve response to admission from any source. And we advocate for climate resilience, long-term infrastructure solutions such as undergrounding the highest-risk miles on our system, all of which create a fundamentally safer California for citizens and investors. Wildfire risk was elevated this year, and the ignition count is up as a result. As shown here on Slide 5, the ignition rate in high fire-threat areas under R3 plus [ph] conditions is standing at 1.44 for the rolling 12 months through November 4. This is notably lower than 2017 and 2018, demonstrating that even under higher risk conditions, California is safer. Incidents affecting 10 acres or more for California, predominantly nonutility cost ignitions, have also increased more than threefold this year versus 2023, given the more challenging weather conditions. Despite this backdrop, here's the metric that matters, a multiyear trend of no major fires due to PG&E equipment. While we're never satisfied, this summer was one more proof point that our physical risk mitigations are working. While our operational mitigations have proven effective, they do come with a reliability trade-off. That's why we continue to believe that strategic undergrounding in the highest risk locations is the right solution for our service territory. Turning to Slide 6. Related to the Dixie Fire. We were pleased to share last month that the state Wildfire Fund has paid our first set of claims for $39 million. Our second monthly request for $34 million was paid out on October 28, and we intend to continue submitting our claims on a monthly cadence going forward. This is another proof point of Assembly Bill 1054 working as designed. As you know, we're also working every day to execute on our simple, affordable model shown here on Slide 7. The simple affordable model is how we plan to keep customer build growth at or below assumed inflation, as we continue to invest in critical infrastructure. This is a proven winning model supported by our lean operating system and bolstered by California's leadership in the transition to clean energy. We have a strong existing plan, as shown here on the left. And as we announced today, we're pulling some additional capital into the plan to better serve our customers, while maintaining balance sheet health. We continue to see opportunities for further amplification through incremental O&M reductions and electric load growth. We're working each element of this model every day with no big best approach, as Carolyn will discuss. But first, let's dive deeper into the PG&E performance playbook in action as we turn to Slide 8 and my story of the month. Our Dublin Innovation Center was created to drive better outcomes for our customers. Last quarter, I shared how one team was reinventing the inspection process, identifying the right work, completing it 50% faster than our previous standard and delivering cost savings, which we look forward to passing along to customers in our next rate case. With the incremental energization capital spend top of mind, I thought I'd share how our service planning and design team is using our performance playbook to rapidly implement regulatory decisions and deliver for our customers. Following the CPUC approval of our initial SB410 energization filing and an incremental $1 billion of funding, the team immediately mobilized. Looking across a number of factors, including customer readiness, permitting agency timelines and materials availability, the team quickly identified over 3,000 incremental customer requests that can be completed this year. The team is also implementing process improvements that lead to labor and cost savings to our customers. For example, we reimagined the application process, which we estimate will reduce our customer cancellation rate by 70%. And we updated the job package preparation and estimating standards, cutting processing time for electric design work by 40%. These are classic examples of waste and rework that we're eliminating to the benefit of customers. I could not be prouder of this and all the other examples I see of coworkers using the tools of our performance playbook to cause better outcomes for our customers and predictable growth for our investors. With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn. Thank you, Carolyn. I'm excited about our differentiated story here at PG&E. Our power pyramid is the path forward. It starts with the foundation of physical and financial safety. That foundation gives us permission to focus on our simple, affordable model. When we saw you in New York in June, we talked about our model and how it can be amplified. Today is another step towards that being realized. Ultimately, we share California's aspiration for growth and a decarbonized economy at a lower societal cost. We are proud to be leading the way and delivering results for our customers and for you, our investors. We're looking forward to seeing you in just a couple of days at EEI. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Good morning. Awesome. Thanks, Shar. Good morning, Steve. Yes. Steve, we definitely want what the Governor wants and what our policymakers want, and that's affordable energy for the people of California. And really, you answered the question for me by mentioning our simple affordable model. That is the pathway. And I think as the state starts to see us truly implementing and delivering those savings, especially when we talk about our rate case that we'll be filing next year for 2027, we'll be able to show the impact of the simple affordable model through that filing. And so we do look forward to helping earn the -- well, to earn the trust of the regulators and our policymakers in this process. But also give them good ideas about what can really drive affordability here in California. I think the idea that we can continue to reduce our cost and grow load. I think the growing load is something that is a big change here. And I think that's going to be exciting and welcome news to our policymakers when they truly understand what the implications are for customer affordability as we invest in the infrastructure to grow load here in California. Yes. Unfortunately, it's a very confidential process. So I can't say much about it, Steve. But obviously, there's still time before the year-end for a resolution on the DOE funding and DOE loan. The thing that we like about the DOE loan is it's just net-net savings for customers. However, we've not built our financial plan assuming anything associated with that. That would be upside and accretive to the plan. Yes, you're welcome. Have a great day, Steve. Yes, great question. We continue to work with OEIS to understand and establish what those filing requirements will be. To-date, they've been more extensive than we expected. And so our filing will -- if the current guidelines as published are the final guidelines, that could very much delay our filing, but we are hopeful to make that undergrounding filing by mid-next year. We continue to stand that in our highest risk areas, undergrounding is the right solution. It's not all our miles, but it is definitely our highest risk miles. And so we do believe that, as directed by the legislature that this undergrounding filing will be able to demonstrate the longer-term cost benefit savings for customers. We know that it is the most affordable way to make our customers safe and to have them not have to choose between having reliability and being safe. And so we look forward to making that filing. We'll continue to work with the OEIS, but I expect our filing will be mid-2025 likely at the earliest. Yes, that obviously is a big driver. It does cost something to do the work. It's not free. And so the proposal -- the filing that we made reflects actual customer demand to both clear any kind of backlog but also to maintain the growth rate that we're seeing. We're seeing about a 10% year-over-year growth rate in new customer connection requests, which is exciting news. I mean, I just think it really bodes well for California. And so we want to fulfill that demand. And the good news is much of that demand can be fulfilled at a continually improving unit cost, which we'll be driving for by improving how we do our work, the way we contract for that work, the way we schedule and bundle that work. All of those process improvements we've been making will be beneficial to customers, but that's fully reflected in the filing that we made, and we look forward to being able to continue to fulfill our customers' expectations as the commission has their role to play in going ahead and approving that important investment in our customers' expectations. Yeah, great. Thanks, Rich Good morning. Yes. Keep in mind, that was their GRC. We're talking about our undergrounding filing, which is based on the new legislation that was passed about a 10-year filing. So two different things. I will say, at a minimum, we have the undergrounding that's been approved in our GRC, which was a total of 1,200 miles, and we are on track to continue to build those miles through 2026. So we have undergrounding in our plan through 2026. The OEIS filing that we'll be making will be supplemental, obviously, to that and longer term. So I do think that here in California, we do need to understand -- and I do think there's a lot of misinformation that's being spread about the cost effectiveness of undergrounding. And we very much believe in the certain conditions, it is the right mitigation. And it is the most cost-effective mitigation. People are forgetting how much we spend on tree trimming and overhead inspections year after year after year. So, for example, in customers' bills today, in our customers' bills, we spend about $1 a month on undergrounding, and we spend $20 a month for vegetation management and inspections. Customers don't understand that. And honestly, I think some of the policy decision makers -- and certainly, the interveners clearly do not understand the actual math. And so we're going to continue to try and make that math clear that, it is in the best interest of customers, not just for safety and reliability, but affordability for undergrounding in our highest risk miles. So we continue to advocate and we will continue to do that and try and make the case. Yeah. Let me clarify that, Julien. We definitely -- we're completing our first cluster study. We should be communicating with those customers here by December, and it was a much more efficient way to study the interconnection of all of this new demand. And it was multiple customers and multiple projects adding up to an initial request of 3.5 gigawatts. Keeping in mind, we only had a couple of hundred megawatts in our plan to begin with. So the 3.5 gigawatts was a nice increase, but that's not been our last request, to be clear. That was just what was in this cluster study. And I feel like the most popular girl in school these days, that I get a call every week about some other projects, somebody wants us to squeeze into our plan and our study. And so one of the things, Julien, that I think about for California and for PG&E specifically, being here in the Bay Area, the demand for being -- having access to this fiber network that's here in the hub that's in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, the demand is real. They thought that we were out of power. And we have been able to confirm that we actually have significant capacity available on our system. We've added both generation and transmission capacity here in California. On the generation side, we added just last year, 9.5 gigawatts of new supply. In California, 10 gigawatts of supply now is battery storage. That really is a great complement to our excess solar that we have midday. So we are open for business in California. I kind of think of us as like the perfect mix, like you can have too much demand that's too expensive to supply, and you can have too little so you don't get the benefit of load growth. I put us right there in the sweet spot, the Goldilocks of load growth is here at PG&E. We have just the right amount that we can fund that's affordable for customers. And I'm excited to build that and we're excited to be able to deliver for these customers who are more and more interested by the day. Thanks, Julien. Hi, Gregg. Well, I think the real focus is just what do we need to do to make the system safer, faster. I think we have shown that our current mitigations are working. And this is the case that we really want to make sure is clear. There is no doubt that the conditions here in California are at a heightened risk level this year. And we're seeing that in the number of 10-acre fires caused by any number of things, predominantly non-utility caused fires. But 10-acre fires across California are way up this year. And understanding that and looking at how effective our mitigations have been is a real conversation that we're having, and people are really starting to see that. The disadvantage of these mitigations -- so when I'm talking about these mitigations, I'm talking about our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings, and I'm talking about the Public Safety Power Shutoffs, which we are continuing to shrink their scope and get them very targeted and restore customers as quickly, as safely possible. And all of that is good, but it's still an outage. And so I think the conversation is, what is an acceptable amount of outage given the risk. So we know that there's only one mitigation that eliminates the risk of both a Public Safety Power Shutoff and a wildfire, and that's undergrounding, which is why we're so bullish on that. However, I think we're also seeing that there are certainly miles and miles. And we've done 1,000 miles already of covered conductor. We think that's important in certain areas that aren't so tree-dense and making sure that we do the right inspections and the right evaluations of the safety of our equipment. So, I would say our discussions with our safety regulators and our financial regulators are very constructive. And they are very complementary of the progress we've made. And there's no doubt that across the state, people feel the change. And we're very proud of our multiyear trend here of no major fires and 2 years specifically with limited to no structural damage. That's the real test of our system and our safety measures. So just real progress. And I think people feel that. I think the healthy debate about what's the right mitigation for the long run, what's the right infrastructure, fit for purpose for the long run, that conversation continues, and we need to keep educating and advocating for the right work for our customers. It was good. I think the bigger question is, do we have alignment between the safety regulator and the financial regulator on scope and cost and what's most effective. And I think that's really what's being discussed is how do we streamline the process of getting a safety regulation signed off on and then how does that feed into the financial approvals. And so I think it's more processed than specific mitigations that are being discussed. Yeah. Well, we just rolled in $1 billion of it. So we'll be looking forward then to the next -- over the next year when the right time to meet Carolyn's 4A, as she called them. That 4As is good disciplined business. And that's -- I think this is just such an important takeaway for this call today. So thanks for reiterating it. PG&E is in a position where we have demand, and we have a disciplined path forward. We have the ability to finance our work. We have the ability to grow our business. We have the ability to better serve our customers. And given a variety of conditions all around us, I'm so proud of the progress that the team has made to truly move forward with growth, industry-leading. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to continue to be disciplined in how we do that for the benefit of customers and consistent financial results for you. Yeah. So you're seeing some of that -- as we speak. Now, the O&M reductions will be reflected in our GRC filing, because that's how we pass those through to customers directly. So you'll see that then. We definitely are trying to signal here today that we see that amplified simple affordable model materializing. So we started with the capital rate base growth that we've grown here. We're seeing the O&M savings internally. In fact, just yesterday -- or earlier this week, I was in our Waste Elimination Center. And I have to tell you, if I could bottle up that enthusiasm that our team is demonstrating actual joy at work and improving how our business is operated. Carolyn mentioned over 200 projects that are being implemented. There was a total of 500 projects that were also, really looked at across all different types of improvements, some of them directly related to O&M, some related to other things. But the team is learning how to transform this business. So we definitely see the amplified simple, affordable model being realized in the next \u2013 near-term as we're able to pass along those savings and reflect then this load growth in our forecast for our next GRC as well. So that's really the mechanism that we have to pass those along to customers. Thank you. Thank you, Eli. Well, everyone, we appreciate you joining us today. And we appreciate your ongoing support. We really feel the momentum. PG&E is delivering the right kind of progress at the right time. And we hope you feel that, too. And we look forward to seeing you at EEI. Have a great day."

            "name": "Carolyn Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Patty and good morning everyone. Today, I'm looking forward to covering three main topics with you. First, our results for the first nine months of 2024; second, our growing capital plan and strong financing plan; and third, how we continue to execute against our simple, affordable model. As you know, performance is power. And our path to investment-grade and constructive regulatory outcomes depends on consistently delivering against our targets. Starting here on Slide 9, we are showing you our earnings growth [ph]. For the first nine months through September, our core earnings of $1.06 are up $0.30 over the same period last year. Remember that last year, our general rate case was not approved until the fourth quarter, and that is when we booked the revenue catch-up for all of 2023. Adjusting the first nine months of 2023 for the GRC timing, our results were up $0.19 year-over-year. The main driver of our year-over-year increase continues to be higher customer capital investment, including the change in ROE from 10% in 2023 to 10.7% for 2024. We continue to drive nonfuel O&M savings throughout the business. This performance is contributing four sets to our results and [Indiscernible] achieved for various programs such as profit improvement per inspection as well as lower contract spend new strategic sourcing. We also remain committed to reinvesting new savings and the orderly upside back into the business to support incremental customer investment. This drove $0.07 of redeployment, including into programs which support risk mitigation, such as conversion maintenance and emergency preparedness and response. As a reminder, we redeploy as a way to derisk future years and deliver consistent performance year-in and year-out. Turning to Slide 10. As you saw earlier, these pulled an incremental $1 billion of CapEx into our five-year plan as a result of the SB410 funding for new energization projects approved during the third quarter. This increases the five-year compound growth in our rate base from 9.5% to 10%. Our share of rate base already authorized picks up to 93% in 2026, including the additional $1 billion for energization spend and $900 million accrued for our Open General Office. Also, we are still signaling an incremental at least $5 billion of additional customer investment opportunities. There is no shortage for customer beneficial work on our transmission and distribution systems. And even after pulling in $8 billion of capital, we still see at least $5 billion in potential. I'll remind you that incremental transmission work would fall under our FERC formula rate. Back in July, the CPUC issued a decision in the second phase of our general rate case, implementing provisions of Senate Bill 410. The commission encouraged us to request incremental funding for 2025 and 2026, if necessary to address customer energization needs. In response to the demand, we're seeing from customers, we filed a supplemental request on October 4, proposing to add $3.1 billion of work for 2025 and 2026. Including timing adjustments, this would amount to a further net addition of $2.8 billion. This represents another proof point of the growing revenue demand we see in California, and we stand ready to serve this demand. The commissions and [indiscernible] and will call for a proposed decision in the first quarter of 2025. Once we have the final decision, we will expect implications both for our workplace and for our financing. As I discussed last quarter, we'll make this devaluation in context of our financial guide posts, namely the incremental capital investments must be beneficial and affordable for customers, accretive to earnings per share and also helpful to our balance sheet. Here on slide 11, you can see that our updated five-year financial plan now reflects $63 billion of CapEx over the period. Of note, no change to our dividend and equity component, no change to our commitment to reduce $2 billion of corporate debt by the end of 2026 and no change to flexibility that we built into this plan. Our updated financing plan continues our commitment to achieving investment-grade ratings and prioritizing customer capital investment. On the slide, you'll see the comparisons plan that we shared with you on our second quarter earnings call. We've increased utility long-term debt issuance and the corporate debt hybrid and other bucket, each by $0.5 billion. These changes reflect the impact of the $1 billion in junior subordinated notes issued in September. I'll remind you that the JSM received 50% equity credit from S&P and Fitch and are an example of our commitment to pursuing the most efficient financing possible. Proceeds to mid hybrid instruments were used in part to pay down $500 million on our term loan base, resulting in a transaction that is neutral to credit rate metrics. The remaining $500 million of JSM proceeds will fund the equity portion of the capital addition to this plan. Lastly, our plan still calls for $3 billion of equity from 2025 to 2028, which we expect to issue on a ratable basis under a normal utility ATM program. This amount is easily achievable for a utility of our size and is in line with many of our industry peers who also utilize ATM program. As we've indicated before, this equity need is already factored into our multiyear earnings per share guidance of at least 10%, now extended through 2025, and at least 9% each year in 2026, 2027 to 2028. Turning to slide 12. As Patty mentioned, our simple affordable model assumes a no-fee-based approach and we are laser focused on executing it every day to make our industry-leading capital growth affordable for all our customers. Here's why I consider this, a no big bets model and why we see further opportunities for amplification. First, in terms of O&M cost savings. We are currently working nearly 200 initiatives to reduce material contracts and other costs to more efficiently plan, execute and automate our work. Our statements are not dependent on any one initiative, as we are reducing waste across the enterprise. We have ample runway to improve our capital to expense ratio, such as reducing annual repairs or ongoing true trend and placing these activities with durable, long-lasting capital improvement, which also benefit customer rates. And we exceeded our O&M reduction goal two years in a row, reducing operating and maintenance expense by 3% in 2022 and 5.5% in 2023. These projects fuel the excitement and momentum you can feel, whether you're out in the field, at our Dublin Innovation Center, or in one of our command centers here in Oakland. We is a way of thinking that is grounded and improving customer experiences at a lower cost. We're proving out the philosophy that this philosophy is well placed at PG&E and is delivering meaningful results. With year-end insight, I'm confident that in 2024, we will meet or exceed our 2% target. Second, load growth. Our load growth will come from electric vehicles, data centers and building electrification. It's not dependent on one mega customer or a project. And state policy and decarbonization goals are driving increased electrification. I'm also excited about the innovations taking place that will help us leverage new load in ways beneficial to the grid. Take, for example, our partnership with the Open School District and Zoom to deploy the nation's the largest bidirectional electric school bus fleet. This EV fleet is equipped with groundbreaking vehicle-to-grid technology, enabling the buses to return annually but the two or more gigawatt hours of energy back to the grid when not in use. Lastly, efficient financing. In addition to our recent convertible and JSN financing, Future opportunities could include other hybrids, DOE loan and grant programs, working capital improvement and credit rating upgrades. Turning to Slide 14. In terms of credit rating, I'll remind you that we're just one notch below investment grade at both Moody's and Fitch and on positive outlook at both. With our strong performance, especially through this challenging fire season, we continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our layers of physical risk mitigation. Coupled with improving financial metrics and maintained strong governance, we see a near-term path to achieving investment-grade credit at the parent company. Growing cash flows drive balance sheet help supports our credit rating improvement and in turn, will help to make our critical customer investment affordable. As you can see here on Slide 15, we grew our operating cash flow by $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. And we're in course to deliver over $3 billion more operating cash flow for the full year, consistent with prior forecasts. Of course, the GRC is a key driver of this improvement, as well as the interim rate release we've seen from the CPUC in our 2022 WMCE and the 2023 WGSD applications. Turning to Slide 16. We continue to work well with policymakers and stakeholders. We saw constructive final decisions in our first SB 410 Signed, our open headquarter purchase and our request for interim rate relief for our 2023 WMCE, all in the third quarter. I'll end here on Slide 17 with a reminder of our value proposition. It's one fueled by differentiated performance, a constructive operating environment and placing the customer at the heart of everything we do. And it's allowing us to deliver 10% rate base growth through 2028, at least 10% core EPS growth in 2024 and now through 2025 and at least 9% core EPS growth each year from 2026 through 2028. With that, I'll hand it back to Patty. Hey, Shar. Yeah, Shar, great question. The $1 billion definitely was the key driver for our increase to 10%. This is this disciplined approach we're talking about to make sure that we get the CapEx approved. It's affordable for customers. It's accretive to EPS. and then we can finance it efficiently. So we were able to meet all of our criteria in this case. And so as we look at the next phase of our filing, the supplemental SB 410, we see that we're going to need additional funding to keep up with customer demand. And so that's great news, I think, for California. I think it's great news for our customers. And so that's why we filed the supplemental. We won't build that into the plan until we know we meet our criteria of our disciplined approach, however. But I do think that bodes well for both customers and investors. No, it doesn't. So the $1 billion of additional CapEx was funded. That was funded by the junior subordinated notes. That was a $1 billion issue. And so that was a very efficient financing. It had 50% equity content. We were pleased to the response to that. I will say -- I'll just remind you, yes, we had no changes -- no further changes to our equity plan in our financing plan. We're still looking at issuing a routine ATM program next year and over the five-year plan, it's in total of $3 billion. And again, no new equity in 2024. Thanks Julien. How you doing?\nQ \u2013 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Good afternoon -- Just moving back to where -- how Rich was a second to go here on the OEIS side. I mean, we saw SDG&E get fairly, at least in a proposed decision, get a fairly de minimis number. Can you speak to that a little bit? I mean, what do you read out of that? I mean, obviously, your service starts a little different here, but anything to note out of that, again, as you plan towards mid next year's filing here, if you will? Thank you. Hi, Gregg. Sure. So we don't normally give intra-year updates, but there is no change to our outlook, which is the mid-teens. What I'll point you to is our operating cash flow, which is absolutely on track to increase $3 billion over 2023 to $8 billion in 2024. And we still see it growing after 2024. Sitting here on November 7, I'm feeling confident that by year-end, we'll be at or very close to that mid-teens guidance that we've put out there, showing significant improvements over 2023. Yes. And Carly, I'll just -- to be clear, we remain absolutely intently focused on improving our credit quality, and we have ongoing conversations with the rating agencies. As we've noted, we're just one notch below investment grade at Moody's. They've been pretty clear that we are already meeting their financial metrics, and we're looking at our performance through another wildfire season. This season was particularly challenging. And as we've noted on the call today, our performance was -- I don't want to her say -- . Very strong. And I think Moody's is going to see that. We're on an annual cycle with Moody's. We're on positive outlook with them, and we're looking forward to having conversations with them and we're optimistic. When we're looking at the -- your question around the timing, but around the $5 billion and when we would expect to bring that in. So maybe I'll just start with the latter point. As we did say, we do have an additional $5 billion of incremental capital that we could bring into our plan. As Patty indicated, it needs to be authorized. I call it the 4As for everybody. This way, you'll remember it. It has to be authorized. It has to be affordable for our customers, has to be accretive to our earnings and we have to be able to finance it efficiently for our balance sheet. So when we think about that, we've already talked about seeing an outcome of the SB 410 supplemental sometime in the first half of 2025. And so we would -- as long as we see a positive outcome then, we would look at it to ensure the guidelines and roll that in. There's additional -- in the pipeline, as we look at that $5 billion, there's additional transmission capacity build out. We talked about the data centers, and we're seeing more requests there. We have some IT improvements that we're looking at. And then there's just the additional work in both generation and our hydros and EV-related capital. So all of that would be brought in. And as we said, over the course of five-year plan as it meets our criteria. But we have a very robust pipeline. I'll just note, we brought in $1 billion this quarter, and yet we didn't change the $5 billion. We didn't put that $5 billion of potential down to $4 billion. We kept it at $5 billion. We have a very robust pipeline. Absolutely. Great. Thanks David. Good morning, Michael. Yeah, Michael, asset sales has not been on the list. It's not -- we've seen -- we've done the sale of the towers in the past. Pac Gen is definitely not something we're moving forward with. So we don't really see that as a primary source of efficient financing in the future. Yeah. Thank you."

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jonathan Arnold, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With us today are Patty Poppe, Chief Executive Officer, and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's earnings presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides, along with other relevant information, can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We'd also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. And with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patty Poppe.\nPatricia Poppe : Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid progress. Our core earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $0.31, bringing us to $0.69 for the first half. We are reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $1.33 to $1.37, up at least 10% from 2023. And we're also reaffirming our longer-term earnings per share growth of at least 9% each year starting in 2025 and continuing through 2028. In addition, we remain firm in our commitment to no new equity in 2024, and there have been no changes to our five-year financing plan, which we shared with you during our first quarter call. Moving to Slide four. We were excited to see so many of you in June at our investor event in New York City. Our message in New York was that with our layers of physical and financial protections as the foundation, and with our simple, affordable model making critical infrastructure investments affordable for our customers, we see a pathway where electrification can deliver a decarbonized energy future at a lower societal cost. As we discussed in New York, new load is actually a key enabler to lowering the unit cost of electricity, eliminating the green premium, and enabling a low carbon future. This potential for a cleaner, more resilient energy future at a lower cost to consumers is why we refer to our graphic on this slide as the power pyramid. It's what motivates our team every day here at PG&E. It's our mandate and also our mission. It's beneficial for our customers and it's also good for our investors. Just this month, in fact, the CPUC voted out Phase 2 of our general rate case, authorizing an incremental $2.3 billion of capital investment for energization with an opportunity to go back in and request more if customers need it. We were encouraged by comments from the commissioners, which supported the thesis that connecting new load can be beneficial for broader customer affordability. At the same meeting, the CPUC approved staff's resolution affirming increasing our return on equity to 10.7%. California's regulatory environment is strong, forward-looking, and delivers real value for customers and investors. Using the power pyramid as our framework, and turning to Slide five, a brief update on our performance mitigating physical risk. The bottom line is that our layers of protection strategy has reduced wildfire risk significantly across our service area. I'm sure you've seen plenty of news coverage of recent heat and wind events we've been experiencing in California, and I could not be prouder of our team for their continued tenacity with consistent execution, day in and day out. Take, for example, the 8.5-day stretch over the July 4th holiday week. This was the longest-duration excessive heat warning ever issued by the National Weather Service Bay Area Office, and it brought in increased system reliability risk as well as elevated wildfire risk. What's important is our readiness posture no matter the conditions on the ground, and the results speak for themselves. No flex alerts and no serious safety incidents. On the reliability front, California has added over nine gigawatts of capacity in just the last year, and it did the job. The state now also has ten gigawatts of battery storage that are providing significant benefits in terms of additional flexible supply to the grid, and this is more than double the battery capacity from this same time last year. Overall, our system performed well in the early July heat wave and benefited from numerous proactive steps taken ahead of time. For example, when looking at San Jose data and comparing July performance to the September 2022 heat wave, unplanned and sustained outages were down more than 50%, with the total cumulative duration of those outages down more than 85%, and the Bay Area region overall saw a 22% reduction in outages. This is climate resilient infrastructure in action for new extreme weather norms. On the wildfire front, the key takeaway is that while we've certainly seen a more active start to this year's wildfire season, as of today, we've had no fires of consequence linked to PG&E. We are pleased with this performance given the increased wildfire activity being seen across California. So far this season, we've planned and prepared for three PSPS events and executed two with about 2,000 customers affected in the largest one. Risk is certainly up versus 2023 with our circuit mile days under high-risk conditions increasing 48% year-to-date and our CPUC reportable ignitions under R3 or higher conditions running at 20 year-to-date versus six at this time last year. These dynamic conditions require a dynamic response. To prevent ignitions, we have layers of protection as listed on slide five, all of which have been improved year-over-year, including another year of inspections and repairs, more vegetation management, and more system hardening, both undergrounding and covered conductor. Finally, when conditions warrant, we can turn to public safety power shutoffs. Where we do have ignitions, thanks to EPSS and improved situational awareness tools, including our weather stations, advanced meteorology, and fire science models, we have less energy released and faster reaction times as our post-ignition mitigations come into play. These include our safety infrastructure protection teams made up of 90 former firefighters who protect our assets every day. Our 32 public safety specialists, most of whom are former CAL FIRE or U.S. Forest Service Chief Officers with at least 30 years of agency leadership experience. Our 24/7, 365 hazard awareness warning center. Over 600 wildfire cameras with AI smoke detection automatically notifying first responders. Plus, rapid response capabilities, including Blackhawk helicopters equipped to drop water on fire retardants, which we are making available to county fire agencies to supplement the significant state-level resources deployed through CAL FIRE. One point I would like to note is that we recently completed a third-party risk assessment by Moody's. Analysis using the Moody's RMS wildfire model estimates that our mitigations have reduced the risk of economic loss to PG&E from wildfires by 93%. Going forward, you should expect us to refer to this third-party benchmark, which it is based on a model widely used by the insurance industry to price risk, takes into account a wider range of conditions than the CPUC methodology we referred to in the past, and provides for better comparability across other utilities. The key message is, no matter the conditions, our physical risk mitigations are making our system safer every day. Turning to Slide 6, financial risk mitigations are also in place through Assembly Bill 1054. These include access to liquidity, an improved prudence standard, and a cap on shareholder exposure. With our customer-funded self-insurance in place since 2023, our near-term financial exposure is limited to $50 million deductibles, while our customers benefit from the significant savings compared to commercial insurance. While the benefits of AB 1054 are in place and working as designed, I know that some of you are keen to see the wildfire fund reimbursement process in action. Well, during the second quarter, we passed the $1 billion threshold for settled claims related to the 2021 Dixie Fire. This means that we are now eligible to access liquidity from the fund. Our accrual for the Dixie Fire remains $1.6 billion, and the fund previously took a $600 million reserve in anticipation of funding our claims. We've been working closely with the administrator to ensure an orderly reimbursement process beginning as soon as the third quarter, with requests for payment to be submitted monthly. We made our first such request earlier in July, and the fund has a statutory requirement to reimburse us within 45 days of claim adjudication. Given that timeline, we anticipate having an update on progress with our next quarterly call. California, both physically and financially, has an entirely differentiated safety posture for our citizens and our investors. Wildfire has become a well-understood risk with well-understood mitigations and controls. Moving up our power pyramid, here on Slide 7 is our simple affordable model with our strong existing plan on the left and the opportunity we see for amplification on the right. Execution against this model is how we make needed safety, reliability, and resiliency investments while keeping bills at or below inflation for our customers. Think of this as our runway for additional value for customers and investors, an enduring winning model with no big bets. Now, let's turn to Slide 8 and my story of the month. I wanted to share an update from the team working on reinventing our inspections. As a reminder, in June, we shared that using our performance playbook, we're avoiding costs by doing the right work through changes to our inspection strategy. You heard from our team at our Dublin Innovation Center that they expect to save over $100 million this year, and that's roughly 50% of our O&M reduction target. Our reinvented process is resulting in less false positives, and the team has already realized $15 million of O&M savings through standard work, aerial inspections, and bundling. Most importantly, we are identifying the right work and completing it 50% faster than our previous standard. This is the power of our performance playbook, and it's just one example of the culture of performance that we are shaping at PG&E. With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn.\nCarolyn Burke : Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm looking forward to covering three topics with you. First, our results of the first half of 2024. Second, our continued execution against our simple affordable model. And third, an update on our regulatory progress. Starting here on Slide 9, we are showing you our walk for our first half results. Through June, our quarter earnings of $0.69 are up $0.17 over the first half of last year. Remember that our general rate case was approved in the fourth quarter when we booked the catch-up revenues for all of 2023. Adjusting the first half of 2023 for the GRC timing, our results are up $0.10 year-over-year. The uplift is mainly driven by higher customer capital investments. Non-fuel O&M savings of $0.03 reflect savings realized by our team reinventing inspections as well as improvements to our contract spend. This is offset by $0.05 reinvested back into the business to fund our emergency response and preparedness programs and incremental corrosion maintenance, just as two examples. Turning to Slide 10, we have not changed our CapEx or rate-based guidance this quarter. However, the recent GRC Phase 2 energization decision has further improved our confidence in the potential for upside. Our base plan continues to include $62 billion of customer capital investment over the next five years with a focus on distribution and transmission. In terms of benefits, our capital plan is balanced, providing safety, enabling new business, supporting the clean energy transition, and improving reliability and resiliency. And we can make it more affordable as we amplify our simple affordable model. As we reaffirmed in June, we have line of sight into at least another $5 billion of incremental T&D investment, and we intend to bring some of this into our plan once we make it affordable for both our customers and our balance sheet. We were pleased to see the commission approve their proposed decision in our GRC Phase 2, implementing provisions of Senate Bill 410 earlier this month. The decision authorizes incremental spend of up to $2.3 billion to fund new energization projects through 2026, with the potential for additional increases in 2025 and 2026, which we were encouraged to request. This decision has increased our percentage of rate-based already authorized and, in our view, is a positive proof point of how we can work constructively with the commission to balance customer needs with affordability and support California's clean energy transition, leveraging the opportunity presented by beneficial load growth. As you know, we plan conservatively and have not yet folded in the full authorized amount to our plan. Finally, I'll remind you, approval for our Oakland General Office, which was moved out of our 2023 GRC into a separate filing, is on the CPUC's consent agenda for August 1st. This is another $900 million of rate-based. As we shared with you on our first quarter call, we have a strong and balanced financing plan in place to support this capital growth. As shown here on Slide 11, there's no change from what we shared with you last quarter. Overall, our plan prioritizes customer capital investment and our commitment to investment grade ratings while also layering in dividend growth over the next five years and meeting our commitment to parent debt paydown. I also want to reinforce that we've built flexibility into our plan and the equity is already contemplated in our earnings guidance of at least 10% this year and at least 9% each and every year through 2028. With our capital and financing plans in place, we are focused on executing against our simple affordable model to ensure this growth is affordable for customers. Moving to Slide 12, reducing operating and maintenance costs. As shown, we beat our 2% reduction target in both 2022 and 2023. I believe three years would be a trend and I'm pleased to report that we are making good progress against our target again in 2024 and I am confident that we will meet or exceed our 2% goal. And let me tell you why? In 22 and 2023, large enterprise level programs helped us come in better than target. Going forward, we can see planning, execution, and automation ramping up as our team is trained and executes against our performance playbook, including our lean operating systems and breakthrough thinking. You can also expect to see improvements in our capital to expense ratio. This is important for customers because we can afford costly annual repairs with long-term durable capital. For every dollar of ongoing expense saved, we can invest roughly $7 of capital while holding customer bills flat. Our capital to expense ratio is currently 0.8, meaning we spend $0.80 of capital for every dollar of expense. Our peers averaged 1.4 in 2022 and improved to 1.6 in 2023. Our five-year plan would bring us nearly on par with the peer average. And as you can imagine though, we don't plan on for average. And the best in class utilities currently have capital to expense ratios well above 2. The next element of our simple affordable model is load growth. Overall, we're in a differentiated position when it comes to beneficial load growth. Specifically, we are the hometown utility to Silicon Valley, home of AI and innovation and headquarters to major cloud service providers. As Jason Glickman, our head of engineering detailed in June, the Bay Area has the best fiber network and connects to a grid that is majority powered by renewables, making it one of eight primary data center markets in the U.S. We also have one of the largest overlapping electric and gas distribution service areas. And finally, our state and local policies are driving the need for electrification. I want to emphasize that beneficial load growth is new load that helps to reduce monthly electric bills for our existing customers. It allows us to deliver industry-leading rate-based growth and deliver on our plan to keep customer bill growth at or below inflation. We shared the map here on Slide 13 with you in June. Specifically, how data centers and even to a larger extent, electric vehicles can improve customer affordability. Specifically, incremental revenue from this new load without a need to modify our tariff is projected to more than offset the cost of our additional capital needed. This final element of our simple affordable model is efficient financing. I am pleased to provide you with an update that we expect to close our final securitization issuance under AB 1054 next week. In aggregate, the three AB 1054 issuances support $3.2 billion of safety spend while delivering meaningful financing savings to our customers. As we continue to deliver on our simple affordable model and meet our commitments, we also see continued progress working with policymakers and stakeholders as shown on slide 14. We already discussed the Commission's final decision on our GRC capacity phase and their affirmation of our increase to an ROE of 10.7% under the cost of capital adjustment mechanism. Additionally, we continue to work towards final guidelines with our safety regulator, OEIS, for our 10-year undergrounding filing. As we like to say, performance is power, and we're pleased to see our performance reflected in steadily improving credit ratings as shown here on slide 15. We're now just one notch below investment grade at both Moody's and Fitch and on positive outlook of both. We will continue to build upon the progress we've made reducing physical risk, improving financial metrics, and maintaining strong governance as we remain steadfast in our goal to achieve investment-grade credit at the parent company. Finally, here on Slide 16, I'd like to end by leaving you with a reminder of our value proposition. It's one fueled by differentiated performance, placing the customer at the heart of everything we do and delivering 9.5% rate-based growth through 2028 and at least 10% core earnings per share growth in 2024 and at least 9% 2025 through 2028. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patty.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Carolyn. Our power pyramid is our differentiated path forward built on the foundation of safety with well-understood and well-managed wildfire-related physical and financial risk. Our simple affordable model delivers for customers and investors with room to grow. Ultimately, California's aspiration for an electrified economy at a lower societal cost is our destination and we are well on our way. This is a winning proposition for our customers, for the state of California, and for you, our investors. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza : Hey guys, good morning. Patty, obviously you guys have talked about this in the prepared comments, but it's obviously been a pretty active fire season. So starting off kind of on the plan for undergrounding, I mean obviously we appreciate that you're waiting for the final go-ahead for filing, but I guess how have your assumptions and plan evolved over the past few quarters? Any thoughts on maybe layering in incremental miles versus the GRC approved levels?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, that's a great question. Obviously undergrounding is top of mind and I'll open by saying we continue to see undergrounding as a critical element of our total layers of protection. It's one of the layers and one of the most important layers in our highest risk, most vegetation dense areas. So we definitely stand by our commitment to underground our highest risk miles. As we work through the application process of our 10-year filing, look, we're still working through with OEIS. In fact, there's a public workshop scheduled for today to continue to look at the necessities related to the filing. And so as we look at the timing of that filing, it's going to be wholly dependent on what those requirements are and what the expectations of OEIS require. So given that, we have 1,230 miles approved in the GRC through 2026. And we intend to, obviously, we're on track this year to meet the mileage requirements. I don't see us filing a different kind of filing between here and the filing of the 10-year plan. And so I don't think there will be incremental mileage added outside of either our next GRC or the undergrounding 10-year plan. Those are two good mechanisms. And given the direction of our regulators, we'll use the appropriate one to file for the next range of miles.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Okay, that's perfect. Thank you. And then just lastly, any comments on sort of the Park Fire in Butte County? I mean, is there any kind of early indications on the cause or any kind of presence of PG&E's equipment? I guess, how are you executing on PSPS preparedness and response in that area? I mean, it's such a new event. There's no data on it, no EIRs, and we're getting a lot of questions. It'd be great if you can maybe just provide a little bit of elaboration. Thanks.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, well, first of all, our hearts go out to the folks near and around Chico, and we pray for their safety and the safety of our firefighters who are out there doing valiant work. Right now, there are no indications of our equipment being involved or contributing at this time, and there are no anomalies detected on our system at the reported time of the fire start. And one of the things, Shar, that I'll share with you that gives me great comfort, and I would hope that it would give investors great comfort, is we know. We can see our situational awareness with our 24/7, 365 Hazard Awareness Center. We're on the job, and we can see, we know what's happening. We can have boots on the ground immediately, and I'm just so thankful for our partnership with CAL FIRE, as well as our own safety crews that I mentioned in our prepared remarks, and our public safety specialists. They give us a level of awareness and understanding that just didn't exist just a handful of years ago, and I'm so thankful for our team being so ready and on the job at all times. I will offer, you mentioned PSPS. You know, here it is July. We haven't done PSPSs in July before, but we did this year. That's our readiness posture. We've done two small ones. The first one was about 2,000 people. Look, these are -- we've sectionalized our system. We've enabled the ability to very targetedly respond to changing conditions and be prepared. I just can't overly emphasize how important it is that that daily readiness should be reinforced for folks. We have a totally differentiated safety posture here in California, and specifically my team here at PG&E is ready and on the job and partnered with CAL FIRE hand in glove.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Thank you, and I know it's been a very difficult season this year, and congrats on the execution so far around it. It's pretty obvious. Appreciate it.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Shar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleischman with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman : Yes, good morning. Thanks.\nPatricia Poppe: Morning, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes, no, would agree, a lot of success in managing that risk this year. So just on the, I guess a couple questions. First, to a degree, it sounds like you're getting closer to potentially being in a position to invest some of the incremental capital beyond the plan. And just any framework to think about the financing part of that once you get there? Yes.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Steve. Yes, so I think what's very important is that, and we've communicated this before, that we do have a framework. We have certain guideposts when we consider financing any new capital. One, it needs to be affordable for customers, and then we define that as being within the 2% to 4% of bill growth that we've talked about over the course of our plan. It must be accretive to EPS. And, again, I'll just remind you that our current financing plan assumes issuance of equity and still meets the 10% growth this year and 9% in \u201825 to \u201828. And, finally, it needs to be helpful to our balance sheet. So those are our goalposts. And when you look at our current financing plan, two key elements that we've maintained. It's balanced, and it provides flexibility. And that flexibility, again, is in the ramp-up of the dividend and then the parent debt pay-down of $2 billion by the end of 2026. So when we think about new capital, we, you know, just think about our current financing plan and using that same approach. We're going to be balanced, and we're going to try to maintain flexibility. And so you can assume, one way to think about this is that you can assume that we're going to follow our authorized regulatory structure at the utility and always find ways to make it as efficient as possible by using the parent debt -- on the parent level. So we'll always be mindful of market conditions. We're very aware of where our stock is trading. And we're going to maintain, as I said, that balance and that flexibility.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then one other question, just I know you've been highlighting the data center growth in your region, and then also in the past the -- I think been the leader in electric vehicle adoption. Could you just be curious to get some of the data? I know you're decoupled, but it'd still be good to get some of the data on how those things are tracking this year.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Thanks, Steve. This is an exciting part of our story. And, you know, as we mentioned in New York, and some people may remember this, right now in our plan, we only have a couple hundred megawatts of data center load growth built into our capital plan. So the cluster study that's underway where we're looking at our pipeline of data center demand that we shared in New York, we're going to make sure that any of that we would add in would be incrementally beneficial for customers, both on cost savings for customers, most specifically. We don't want our residential customers subsidizing the big data center load growth. And so this year that study is underway. We have a lot of demand, as we mentioned. And, in fact, by offering up the opportunity to participate in this cluster study, we've gotten much better visibility to what the real forecasted expectations should be. And so when we complete that study, we'll share those results. But, obviously, that's not materializing in terms of load this year because that's the plan for coming years. On the EV front, EVs continue to sell well here. We're up to now 610,000 EVs on the road in California, in fact, in our service area, up from 580 that we reported in New York. So we're tracking at about 25% of new vehicles sold continue to be electric. And given the CARB Regulation, the executive order here in California for banning internal combustion engines by 2035, we are actively benefiting from the transition. And it's interesting because I know I spend time in other parts of the country, and when I'm there, I don't see what I see here in California, which is an active adoption of electric vehicles and the infrastructure being built out to serve them. So we continue to see EV load growth, and that's, again, beneficial, as we shared, to customers from a cost perspective. Both that customer who bought the EV saves about 20% of their household energy costs because the switch from gasoline to electricity is cheaper, as well as all customers benefit because that's the kind of beneficial load that we love the most.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. I was just wondering if you could walk through the energization order in process going forward to secure more of the CapEx at this point?\nPatricia Poppe: So are you asking, Jeremy, about the regulatory procedures, or are you asking about the actual CapEx?\nJeremy Tonet: The procedures.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, okay. So first of all, you know, the commission's order to include $2.3 billion of incremental funding is a cap. And so what we do then is we'll make filings that reflect what we actually were completing and up to that cap. So what was really good was that the commission made it clear that if there were incremental demand beyond that cap, which frankly we see, then we can make additional applications. And we'll consider doing that even yet this year to show that when we have real demand that we can serve, we'll file for that and that should give the commission then more visibility into what the actual customer need is. And therefore, that could go above and beyond that $2.3 billion cap.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it.\nPatricia Poppe: Does that answer your question, Jeremy?\nJeremy Tonet: Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then just continuing on, unpacking a bit more of your discussion on ground conditions, can you walk through what you're seeing on the ground and how to think about factors contributing to the uptick in ignition rate as discussed?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, because of the moisture that we received early in the year, the fuel levels are very high. So there's a lot of grasses and then it got really hot. So those excessive fuels got very dry. So the fuel moisture levels are very low. And that means that there is a risk of even, a small spark can quickly move. But let me give a shout out to a couple of things. You know, we talked a little bit in our prepared remarks about our layers of protection post-ignition. And this is really important. We talked about this in New York as well. And I think it's probably a part of our layers of protection that are least understood. We have, first of all, visibility to real-time information about an ignition occurring. And so our AI-enabled cameras can directly alert a first responder. In the past, it took some good citizen noticing there was smoke somewhere and calling someone. If you can imagine, that's a very unpredictable response. Our AI cameras now enable very predictable response. Our Hazard Awareness Center is monitoring those cameras. They see it. They confirm that first responders have been notified. And then our safety infrastructure preparedness teams are out there, protection teams are out there, often on the site nearly as quickly as our first responders. We are our own first responders protecting our assets. So then you combine that with CAL FIRE. And there's a couple stats I'd love to share about CAL FIRE that might surprise you. First of all, kudos to California and California policymakers and our governor for continuing to fund the importance of these first responders. So CAL FIRE's budget has tripled since 2015. It was $1 billion. It is now $3 billion annually. And there were no cuts this year, even though there was budget constraints here in the state. Their staffing is up 80%. We have 12,000 CAL FIRE professional firefighters on the job every day, and we couldn't be more grateful for their great work. And then finally, the CAL FIRE aircraft system, it is the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world. We have 60 aircraft that are armed and ready to go. And, in fact, our CAL FIRE aerial fleet can get anywhere that they serve in under 20 minutes when there's sign of trouble. Listen, California's posture is dramatically improved from previous years. This is a statewide effort. PG&E's posture is dramatically changed, but so has the states and our neighborhoods, our communities. And I couldn't be more thankful for the partnerships across the state for all the good work that's happening. So I just want people to understand that when we say California's safety posture is differentiated, we've got lots of evidence to validate that we have the financial protections with AB 1054, but we have massive physical protections that make a catastrophic wildfire very unlikely.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Clearly very differentiated today, so that's great to hear. And I just want to kind of come back to a question I've asked in the past and you had commentary on before. And just as far as, you know, national policy is concerned as it relates to wildfires, just wondering if you're seeing anything incremental there as far as more alignment on a potential national solution or at least the attention level getting received right now?\nPatricia Poppe: You know, we're actively involved in those discussions, mainly providing, you know, insight and experience. Our lawyers and the federal affairs teams are very engaged across the utilities to understand what are the benefits of AB 1054, how could something be structured like that federally. And I would say there's definitely lots of interest from the western states. I do think it's a long put from some of the other states who are not as affected by wildfire to want to support a national solution. But we keep making the case that this is just another climate resilience infrastructure standard that needs to be established and where some states have risk of hurricanes or tornadoes or flooding. Those states that have risk of wildfire need to have a preparedness plan. And if there's a federal backstop, I think that really helps serve the smaller states that don't have the paying capacity and the volume and scale that California has that can deal with a problem like this.\nJeremy Tonet: That makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Dumoulin Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nCarolyn Burke: Hi, Julian.\nPatricia Poppe: Hey, Julian. Welcome back. Nice to hear your voice.\nJulian Dumoulin Smith: Yes, likewise. Absolutely. Sorry I missed you guys last month. Well, look, Patty, let me ask you this. Again, apologies about missing you last month, but you've had a great run. I mean, I was thinking about this in the context of the IC and bringing it all together. And I'm curious as you reflect here on four years of the company or almost four years, I think, how do you think about committing to another contract extension? I'm thinking big picture here. You've got a five-year deal. It's been a great run. You've built out a robust team around you here. How would you just set expectations on a contract extension? I think there's like a one-year possibility here. What have you formally written in there? But just how would you set as we come in on one year left under the contract here? And having resolved a lot of -- well, having resolved or at least on track to resolve a lot of the bigger questions here.\nPatricia Poppe: So, Julian, a couple things. Number one is my honor to lead the people at PG&E. And this has been the greatest challenge of my professional career. And I'm so happy to be part of the team. On the contract front, there's a lot of work to do. I definitely don't think we're done and nor will we be done in a year from now. We'll work through the contract. But what's most important and the thing that I remind my team all the time is that we're building a system. We've got a performance playbook here at PG&E. We're building a bench. We're building a talent machine. So, we don't have to rely on one person that is the linchpin to the whole program. This isn't a charismatic CEO turnaround that when she goes, all of a sudden, the thing falls apart. My job is to build a system that lasts and stands the test of time. And that's what we're up to. And when I go off into the sunset, it's going to be when I know that that performance playbook is solid and my team is equipped and able to execute the continued service to the people of California at the standards that I expect.\nJulian Dumoulin Smith: Got it. Excellent. I'm looking forward to it. And kudos, indeed, on building out a really robust team here. It's been impressive. Carolyn, just to pivot back to some of the earlier conversation here on financing, and I know there's been a lot of commentary here. How do you think about the timeline here on kind of addressing credit improvement? Right now, I think there's been some discussion about the $2 billion of corporate debt reduction getting extended to 2028 versus maybe \u201826 previously. So, how do you think about the timeline here at the same time some of the challenges faced to get the financing that you guys had previously been pushing for? Is there parent debt capacity at this point? How do you think about that against the wider target? And ultimately, is there an ability to increase CapEx in this environment, or is it more about shifting things around prior to addressing the financing backdrop?\nCarolyn Burke: Yes, there's a lot there, Julian. Thank you for the question. So, let me just start with in terms of timeline and improving our overall financial health. I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made. You can just look to our credit ratings, and that's sort of proof in the pudding that we've had a number of upgrades recently. We're just one notch below investment grade at Moody's and on positive outlook there, similar with Fitch, and even S&P upgraded us in the last year. So, we have those continued conversations, and we're continuing to see positive momentum there. We're on target for our capital investment this year. We have SB410 right in front of us now, and that's particularly constructive and helpful for our outlook there. We're on target for our O&M savings of at least 2%, and we're on target for our EPS growth. And particularly important, if you look at our operating cash flow, we are on target to increase from $5 billion in 2023 to $8 billion in 2024. So, all of those are very positive signs in terms of and keeping us on track towards our investment grade and improving our balance sheet. When we think about new capital, I mentioned that earlier in terms of bringing it into the plan. I will say our current financing plan, again, we've built it to be balanced and to have flexibility. So, when we think about that parent debt, which we have a commitment to pay down by the end of 2026 in the amount of $2 billion, that remains at this point in time, but there is flexibility there in terms of both the timing and the amount of that pay down. So, that's how we're thinking about it. And so, that provides us flexibility to bring in new capital into the plan. Again, I'll just repeat, is the dividend and the ramp up of that dividend. Right now, as we've communicated, we see it going slower in the front end and then increasing in the back end. But that is our choice as well. And that's what differentiates us is that we have a choice about how we ramp up that dividend to facilitate additional capital.\nPatricia Poppe: And you know what? I'll add a couple of points, Julian, on what it means to add that additional capital. Let's get concrete here on the SB410. First of all, a great recognition that there is such a thing as beneficial load for the people of California. So, our CPC reflected that. We had about $1 billion of energizations in our current plan. So the incremental $1.3 billion is a perfect example of what Carolyn's talking about. In order to fold that additional $1.3 billion into the plan, there's a couple things that have to happen. Number one, we need to plan the work. We need to be ready to do the work. We need to be able to do that work at the lowest cost. We need to see that simple, affordable model actually materialize. We need to see those O&M savings. We need to be able to see efficient financing pathways. And then we can enable that load growth, which is enabled by this very good CPUC directive. So, given that, you'll see in time we'll build out that work plan first and foremost, the most important step. And then we'll figure out how to then get that financing and make sure this is affordable both for the balance sheet and for customers. And this is just another example. I can't tell you how optimistic I am about the regulatory constructs here in California, the enthusiasm we have from policymakers and legislators about the potential prosperity enablement that PG&E has for the state of California. This is a perfect example of how that's coming to fruition in the numbers.\nJulian Dumoulin Smith: Yes, indeed. I hear you on this, B410. Thank you guys very much. I'll see you soon, all right? Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCarly Davenport : Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to just start on the O&M target. I guess how should we think about the path or catalyst there to maybe shift towards the opportunity level that you highlighted at the investor event versus that 2% target? I think, Carolyn, you had referenced three years being a trend. So just curious of sort of getting through this year at or above target could be what you need to see to get comfortable there.\nCarolyn Burke: No, that's exactly right. I think of three years as real proof that, as Patty said, the performance playbook is being executed upon across the company. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're on target for at least 2% or exceeding the 2% this year. So we're halfway through. We are seeing both smaller initiatives come through with savings and larger initiatives come through with savings. And so I'm very comfortable with where we are at this point in the year, the 2%.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, Carly, and I'll just add it. This is Patty. I'll add a little bit of layering on to that. Because how does this work? How do you make it real? We have a waste elimination as our play five in our lean playbook. We've taught thousands of our co-workers about how to see and identify waste. We then have a weekly operating review where we are reviewing people's ideas, a funnel of ideas, thousands of ideas coming through that funnel to determine which ones have the most viability and how do we convert them from an idea into execution. These are bottoms-up ideas coming from our people all across the organization, because we can see that ratio of capital to O&M. They experience the ratio of capital to O&M of 0.8 to 1 in how we do our work, in how work comes to them, in the waiting that they might experience, in inefficient paper processes that could be automated and digitized. Our people are really getting enthusiastic about our waste elimination targets. In fact, our IT department has a waste can award that they present. We're having a good time with this because making your work easier to do, and I think all of us, every one of us at all of our companies, can imagine doing our work more efficiently in some of the laborious processes and steps we have can be eliminated and work can be more fun. You can do higher value work for a lower cost for customers. That's what we're teaching people how to do and systematically teaching it. As Carolyn said, we have some big ticket items, and those are great. We love those as a kind of a priming of the pump, but what we really love is when all of our co-workers are learning to see waste and eliminate it on a daily basis, and that's the culture of performance that we're shaping here. That's what we want to really communicate here on the call.\nCarly Davenport: Very clear. Appreciate that color. And then just one quick follow-up. Apologies if I missed this in response to Jeremy's question earlier, but did you have any thoughts from a timing perspective on when you might look to file incremental requests around SB410 to sort of address the backlog of new connection requests?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, we haven't determined when we would file, but what will drive that is customer demand. And so as we fill out our work plan, now that we have this decision, we're working our work plan for \u201824. We're already building our \u201825 and \u201826 work plan, and where we see we've got deficiencies, where we've got more demand than the decision allows, then that's what we'll file for that incremental funding. What I can tell you is that we see that demand is outstripping that $2.3 billion, which, again, is another signal of the growth here in California, of our potential for growth. We just need to build a work plan so that when we make that filing, we've got the real bottoms-up demand numbers for the commission to make a good decision.\nCarly Davenport: That makes a ton of sense. Great. Thanks so much for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.\nGregg Orrill: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Patty, I was wondering if you could comment on, you know, again, on what you're seeing in terms of the path of bill increases. I guess some of the, you know, interveners have been out there talking about double-digit percent change increases over the next several years, namely Cal Advocates. Just what do you think the disconnect is there?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, you know, I think, Greg, that Cal Advocates does not yet understand the simple affordable model. This is new for California. This is new for PG&E. And so we will prove out that we can maintain rate increases below the rate of inflation with the simple affordable model. We have all the key components. That's why we're so excited about the amplification of that simple affordable model with more O&M savings, more efficient financing, more load growth. Being able to demonstrate that for our customers is going to take some time. They're going to have to learn to trust that what we say is what we'll do. And so that's just, I just think it's a matter of time. They're forecasting based on previous experience, not based on what we know that we are doing here at PG&E.\nGregg Orrill: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning team. Just, I guess, two quick ones, maybe a segment of PG&E that we kind of forget or we don't talk about enough is the gas system. I'm just wondering, you know, I know you're decoupled, but the throughputs of the gas system year over year, have you seen increases, decreases in the electrification, -- electrification really impacting the throughputs of that system?\nPatricia Poppe: So far, Anthony, again, heavily weather dependent, our throughput, but pretty flat, pretty flat. I wouldn't say we've seen notable decrease in throughput as a result of electrification, though we've seen it in targeted locations, where we make a decision, for example, I do think PG&E is uniquely positioned because of our overlapping gas and electric service areas. So we're really well equipped to answer these questions, Anthony. But where we see a specific case, for example, we have a mobile home program where if we were scheduled to replace the service lines for that mobile home, we've determined that per mobile home it's cheaper to electrify those mobile homes than it is to actually change those gas service lines. And so in those cases, we're doing what we call targeted electrification. We're doing some other projects where we want to start to show that electrification is viable for homes and economic. And so that's where we're really working to prove out those theories. And so I see this gas throughput change probably in the latter half of our 10-year plan versus so much here in the first next five years.\nAnthony Crowdell: And just to follow up, I love the capital to expense ratio. Is that number similar for the gas and electric segments of PG&E or it's, you know, I guess less, -- I'll leave it there?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, they're similar across the enterprise. And, you know, we can get into some of those details and get you some more of those specifics, Anthony, after the call. But, yeah, they're pretty similar enterprise-wise.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine : Good morning. Notice you made progress on the percentage of rate base authorized on slide 10 across \u201824 to 2028. What are the drivers besides SB410 cap spending, particularly for 2027 and 2028 up to the period end?\nPatricia Poppe: It's predominantly, Ryan, SB410, as well as the OGO approval that we received affected in. Go ahead, Carol.\nCarolyn Burke: So it is -- the increase that we saw on that, on the authorized, is all SB410. So we had assumed some of the $2.3 billion in our plan, but we hadn't assumed the full $2.3 billion. So the percentage increase is reflected there. We'll just remind you that there are two other things. OGO is on the docket to be approved on August 1st. So that's another $900 billion. And so that would then further secure or push that percentage up higher. And then we've also filed back in March, our gas AMI application, which is another $500 million. That's not on the docket yet, but that's been filed. So we continue to make progress in terms of things that were kicked out of the GRC. We're making those filings and we're seeing those things come to fruition.\nPatricia Poppe: And just to clarify the OGO. Yes, sorry. The OGO is $900 million.\nCarolyn Burke: Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?\nRyan Levine: Okay. So you're assuming the SB410 CapEx continues beyond \u201826. Is that what I'm hearing?\nPatricia Poppe: The rate base continues. Yes, of course.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then in terms of the fire protection index that you had highlighted in a previous analyst day, any sense on what the outlook is for the remaining portion of this year compared to prior years on that internal PG&E Fire Protection Index?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Our FPI, we're showing more days in higher risk conditions, for sure. The R3 and above days are up. Yes. And so, and our forecasts are showing because of the fuel moisture levels, until we get, you know, more moisture in the atmosphere, we're going to continue to see those high risk days. But thankfully we are well positioned and continue to have the necessary layers of protection that both predict and prevent as well as respond. And I'm very proud of the team for the progress made.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then one just clarifying question, Carol, I think you mentioned that next week you're planning to issue the third AB1054 fund issuance? Just wanted to clarify if that was the correct message.\nCarolyn Burke: That's right. We're going to close it next week.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Michael Lonegan with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lonegan : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So going back to O&M, you talked about meeting or exceeding the 2% non-fuel reduction this year. I saw your savings year to date is $52 million versus the targeted $200 million, you know, about 25% of your target, you know, halfway through the year. I was just wondering are savings currently behind due to summer conditions this year, or was there a planned acceleration for the second half the whole time? And how much do we expect, you know, in terms of savings in Q3 versus 2.4?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, typically you're going to get, some of those ideas rolling in the beginning of the year and they materialize in the second half of the year. So that's not unusual. We would expect to see that kind of trend.\nCarolyn Burke: And that's just a reminder that O&M is full O&M reduction.\nMichael Lonegan: Okay, great. Thank you. And then you reaffirmed your undergrounding target of 250 miles this year. You know, with this quarter, you installed 46 miles underground and energized 15 miles in the first quarter. I know first quarter is typically low because of snow conditions in some of your territory. But, you know, implying an acceleration and undergrounding the balance of the year, just wondering if summer conditions have presented a risk to the full year target, you know, given a potential diversion of workforce to unplanned work?\nPatricia Poppe: No, not at all. You know, in fact, let me just remind you. Last year we did 364 miles. This year's target is 250. We still have our, our same process improvements are in place. We've completed 61 miles through the end of June, but let me clarify what that means. We've energized 61 miles. The civil work for those 250 miles as well underway. And that's all the, that's the heaviest lifting that has to get done and the energization quickly catches up the mileage in the second half of the year. That's a very similar pattern to, to previous years. And we are right on track.\nMichael Lonegan: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Thanks Michael.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Patty for any closing remarks.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks Brianna. Well, thank you everyone for joining our call. And I just hope you see what we see. Continued progress on a path to differentiated things. Affordable and a growing company. We're delivering for our customers and then in turn for you, our investors. Thanks for tuning in today and please stay safe out there.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carolyn Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm looking forward to covering three topics with you. First, our results of the first half of 2024. Second, our continued execution against our simple affordable model. And third, an update on our regulatory progress. Starting here on Slide 9, we are showing you our walk for our first half results. Through June, our quarter earnings of $0.69 are up $0.17 over the first half of last year. Remember that our general rate case was approved in the fourth quarter when we booked the catch-up revenues for all of 2023. Adjusting the first half of 2023 for the GRC timing, our results are up $0.10 year-over-year. The uplift is mainly driven by higher customer capital investments. Non-fuel O&M savings of $0.03 reflect savings realized by our team reinventing inspections as well as improvements to our contract spend. This is offset by $0.05 reinvested back into the business to fund our emergency response and preparedness programs and incremental corrosion maintenance, just as two examples. Turning to Slide 10, we have not changed our CapEx or rate-based guidance this quarter. However, the recent GRC Phase 2 energization decision has further improved our confidence in the potential for upside. Our base plan continues to include $62 billion of customer capital investment over the next five years with a focus on distribution and transmission. In terms of benefits, our capital plan is balanced, providing safety, enabling new business, supporting the clean energy transition, and improving reliability and resiliency. And we can make it more affordable as we amplify our simple affordable model. As we reaffirmed in June, we have line of sight into at least another $5 billion of incremental T&D investment, and we intend to bring some of this into our plan once we make it affordable for both our customers and our balance sheet. We were pleased to see the commission approve their proposed decision in our GRC Phase 2, implementing provisions of Senate Bill 410 earlier this month. The decision authorizes incremental spend of up to $2.3 billion to fund new energization projects through 2026, with the potential for additional increases in 2025 and 2026, which we were encouraged to request. This decision has increased our percentage of rate-based already authorized and, in our view, is a positive proof point of how we can work constructively with the commission to balance customer needs with affordability and support California's clean energy transition, leveraging the opportunity presented by beneficial load growth. As you know, we plan conservatively and have not yet folded in the full authorized amount to our plan. Finally, I'll remind you, approval for our Oakland General Office, which was moved out of our 2023 GRC into a separate filing, is on the CPUC's consent agenda for August 1st. This is another $900 million of rate-based. As we shared with you on our first quarter call, we have a strong and balanced financing plan in place to support this capital growth. As shown here on Slide 11, there's no change from what we shared with you last quarter. Overall, our plan prioritizes customer capital investment and our commitment to investment grade ratings while also layering in dividend growth over the next five years and meeting our commitment to parent debt paydown. I also want to reinforce that we've built flexibility into our plan and the equity is already contemplated in our earnings guidance of at least 10% this year and at least 9% each and every year through 2028. With our capital and financing plans in place, we are focused on executing against our simple affordable model to ensure this growth is affordable for customers. Moving to Slide 12, reducing operating and maintenance costs. As shown, we beat our 2% reduction target in both 2022 and 2023. I believe three years would be a trend and I'm pleased to report that we are making good progress against our target again in 2024 and I am confident that we will meet or exceed our 2% goal. And let me tell you why? In 22 and 2023, large enterprise level programs helped us come in better than target. Going forward, we can see planning, execution, and automation ramping up as our team is trained and executes against our performance playbook, including our lean operating systems and breakthrough thinking. You can also expect to see improvements in our capital to expense ratio. This is important for customers because we can afford costly annual repairs with long-term durable capital. For every dollar of ongoing expense saved, we can invest roughly $7 of capital while holding customer bills flat. Our capital to expense ratio is currently 0.8, meaning we spend $0.80 of capital for every dollar of expense. Our peers averaged 1.4 in 2022 and improved to 1.6 in 2023. Our five-year plan would bring us nearly on par with the peer average. And as you can imagine though, we don't plan on for average. And the best in class utilities currently have capital to expense ratios well above 2. The next element of our simple affordable model is load growth. Overall, we're in a differentiated position when it comes to beneficial load growth. Specifically, we are the hometown utility to Silicon Valley, home of AI and innovation and headquarters to major cloud service providers. As Jason Glickman, our head of engineering detailed in June, the Bay Area has the best fiber network and connects to a grid that is majority powered by renewables, making it one of eight primary data center markets in the U.S. We also have one of the largest overlapping electric and gas distribution service areas. And finally, our state and local policies are driving the need for electrification. I want to emphasize that beneficial load growth is new load that helps to reduce monthly electric bills for our existing customers. It allows us to deliver industry-leading rate-based growth and deliver on our plan to keep customer bill growth at or below inflation. We shared the map here on Slide 13 with you in June. Specifically, how data centers and even to a larger extent, electric vehicles can improve customer affordability. Specifically, incremental revenue from this new load without a need to modify our tariff is projected to more than offset the cost of our additional capital needed. This final element of our simple affordable model is efficient financing. I am pleased to provide you with an update that we expect to close our final securitization issuance under AB 1054 next week. In aggregate, the three AB 1054 issuances support $3.2 billion of safety spend while delivering meaningful financing savings to our customers. As we continue to deliver on our simple affordable model and meet our commitments, we also see continued progress working with policymakers and stakeholders as shown on slide 14. We already discussed the Commission's final decision on our GRC capacity phase and their affirmation of our increase to an ROE of 10.7% under the cost of capital adjustment mechanism. Additionally, we continue to work towards final guidelines with our safety regulator, OEIS, for our 10-year undergrounding filing. As we like to say, performance is power, and we're pleased to see our performance reflected in steadily improving credit ratings as shown here on slide 15. We're now just one notch below investment grade at both Moody's and Fitch and on positive outlook of both. We will continue to build upon the progress we've made reducing physical risk, improving financial metrics, and maintaining strong governance as we remain steadfast in our goal to achieve investment-grade credit at the parent company. Finally, here on Slide 16, I'd like to end by leaving you with a reminder of our value proposition. It's one fueled by differentiated performance, placing the customer at the heart of everything we do and delivering 9.5% rate-based growth through 2028 and at least 10% core earnings per share growth in 2024 and at least 9% 2025 through 2028. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patty. Hi, Julian. Yes, there's a lot there, Julian. Thank you for the question. So, let me just start with in terms of timeline and improving our overall financial health. I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made. You can just look to our credit ratings, and that's sort of proof in the pudding that we've had a number of upgrades recently. We're just one notch below investment grade at Moody's and on positive outlook there, similar with Fitch, and even S&P upgraded us in the last year. So, we have those continued conversations, and we're continuing to see positive momentum there. We're on target for our capital investment this year. We have SB410 right in front of us now, and that's particularly constructive and helpful for our outlook there. We're on target for our O&M savings of at least 2%, and we're on target for our EPS growth. And particularly important, if you look at our operating cash flow, we are on target to increase from $5 billion in 2023 to $8 billion in 2024. So, all of those are very positive signs in terms of and keeping us on track towards our investment grade and improving our balance sheet. When we think about new capital, I mentioned that earlier in terms of bringing it into the plan. I will say our current financing plan, again, we've built it to be balanced and to have flexibility.

            "name": "Patricia Poppe",
            "content": "Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid progress. Our core earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $0.31, bringing us to $0.69 for the first half. We are reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $1.33 to $1.37, up at least 10% from 2023. And we're also reaffirming our longer-term earnings per share growth of at least 9% each year starting in 2025 and continuing through 2028. In addition, we remain firm in our commitment to no new equity in 2024, and there have been no changes to our five-year financing plan, which we shared with you during our first quarter call. Moving to Slide four. We were excited to see so many of you in June at our investor event in New York City. Our message in New York was that with our layers of physical and financial protections as the foundation, and with our simple, affordable model making critical infrastructure investments affordable for our customers, we see a pathway where electrification can deliver a decarbonized energy future at a lower societal cost. As we discussed in New York, new load is actually a key enabler to lowering the unit cost of electricity, eliminating the green premium, and enabling a low carbon future. This potential for a cleaner, more resilient energy future at a lower cost to consumers is why we refer to our graphic on this slide as the power pyramid. It's what motivates our team every day here at PG&E. It's our mandate and also our mission. It's beneficial for our customers and it's also good for our investors. Just this month, in fact, the CPUC voted out Phase 2 of our general rate case, authorizing an incremental $2.3 billion of capital investment for energization with an opportunity to go back in and request more if customers need it. We were encouraged by comments from the commissioners, which supported the thesis that connecting new load can be beneficial for broader customer affordability. At the same meeting, the CPUC approved staff's resolution affirming increasing our return on equity to 10.7%. California's regulatory environment is strong, forward-looking, and delivers real value for customers and investors. Using the power pyramid as our framework, and turning to Slide five, a brief update on our performance mitigating physical risk. The bottom line is that our layers of protection strategy has reduced wildfire risk significantly across our service area. I'm sure you've seen plenty of news coverage of recent heat and wind events we've been experiencing in California, and I could not be prouder of our team for their continued tenacity with consistent execution, day in and day out. Take, for example, the 8.5-day stretch over the July 4th holiday week. This was the longest-duration excessive heat warning ever issued by the National Weather Service Bay Area Office, and it brought in increased system reliability risk as well as elevated wildfire risk. What's important is our readiness posture no matter the conditions on the ground, and the results speak for themselves. No flex alerts and no serious safety incidents. On the reliability front, California has added over nine gigawatts of capacity in just the last year, and it did the job. The state now also has ten gigawatts of battery storage that are providing significant benefits in terms of additional flexible supply to the grid, and this is more than double the battery capacity from this same time last year. Overall, our system performed well in the early July heat wave and benefited from numerous proactive steps taken ahead of time. For example, when looking at San Jose data and comparing July performance to the September 2022 heat wave, unplanned and sustained outages were down more than 50%, with the total cumulative duration of those outages down more than 85%, and the Bay Area region overall saw a 22% reduction in outages. This is climate resilient infrastructure in action for new extreme weather norms. On the wildfire front, the key takeaway is that while we've certainly seen a more active start to this year's wildfire season, as of today, we've had no fires of consequence linked to PG&E. We are pleased with this performance given the increased wildfire activity being seen across California. So far this season, we've planned and prepared for three PSPS events and executed two with about 2,000 customers affected in the largest one. Risk is certainly up versus 2023 with our circuit mile days under high-risk conditions increasing 48% year-to-date and our CPUC reportable ignitions under R3 or higher conditions running at 20 year-to-date versus six at this time last year. These dynamic conditions require a dynamic response. To prevent ignitions, we have layers of protection as listed on slide five, all of which have been improved year-over-year, including another year of inspections and repairs, more vegetation management, and more system hardening, both undergrounding and covered conductor. Finally, when conditions warrant, we can turn to public safety power shutoffs. Where we do have ignitions, thanks to EPSS and improved situational awareness tools, including our weather stations, advanced meteorology, and fire science models, we have less energy released and faster reaction times as our post-ignition mitigations come into play. These include our safety infrastructure protection teams made up of 90 former firefighters who protect our assets every day. Our 32 public safety specialists, most of whom are former CAL FIRE or U.S. Forest Service Chief Officers with at least 30 years of agency leadership experience. Our 24/7, 365 hazard awareness warning center. Over 600 wildfire cameras with AI smoke detection automatically notifying first responders. Plus, rapid response capabilities, including Blackhawk helicopters equipped to drop water on fire retardants, which we are making available to county fire agencies to supplement the significant state-level resources deployed through CAL FIRE. One point I would like to note is that we recently completed a third-party risk assessment by Moody's. Analysis using the Moody's RMS wildfire model estimates that our mitigations have reduced the risk of economic loss to PG&E from wildfires by 93%. Going forward, you should expect us to refer to this third-party benchmark, which it is based on a model widely used by the insurance industry to price risk, takes into account a wider range of conditions than the CPUC methodology we referred to in the past, and provides for better comparability across other utilities. The key message is, no matter the conditions, our physical risk mitigations are making our system safer every day. Turning to Slide 6, financial risk mitigations are also in place through Assembly Bill 1054. These include access to liquidity, an improved prudence standard, and a cap on shareholder exposure. With our customer-funded self-insurance in place since 2023, our near-term financial exposure is limited to $50 million deductibles, while our customers benefit from the significant savings compared to commercial insurance. While the benefits of AB 1054 are in place and working as designed, I know that some of you are keen to see the wildfire fund reimbursement process in action. Well, during the second quarter, we passed the $1 billion threshold for settled claims related to the 2021 Dixie Fire. This means that we are now eligible to access liquidity from the fund. Our accrual for the Dixie Fire remains $1.6 billion, and the fund previously took a $600 million reserve in anticipation of funding our claims. We've been working closely with the administrator to ensure an orderly reimbursement process beginning as soon as the third quarter, with requests for payment to be submitted monthly. We made our first such request earlier in July, and the fund has a statutory requirement to reimburse us within 45 days of claim adjudication. Given that timeline, we anticipate having an update on progress with our next quarterly call. California, both physically and financially, has an entirely differentiated safety posture for our citizens and our investors. Wildfire has become a well-understood risk with well-understood mitigations and controls. Moving up our power pyramid, here on Slide 7 is our simple affordable model with our strong existing plan on the left and the opportunity we see for amplification on the right. Execution against this model is how we make needed safety, reliability, and resiliency investments while keeping bills at or below inflation for our customers. Think of this as our runway for additional value for customers and investors, an enduring winning model with no big bets. Now, let's turn to Slide 8 and my story of the month. I wanted to share an update from the team working on reinventing our inspections. As a reminder, in June, we shared that using our performance playbook, we're avoiding costs by doing the right work through changes to our inspection strategy. You heard from our team at our Dublin Innovation Center that they expect to save over $100 million this year, and that's roughly 50% of our O&M reduction target. Our reinvented process is resulting in less false positives, and the team has already realized $15 million of O&M savings through standard work, aerial inspections, and bundling. Most importantly, we are identifying the right work and completing it 50% faster than our previous standard. This is the power of our performance playbook, and it's just one example of the culture of performance that we are shaping at PG&E. With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn. Thank you, Carolyn. Our power pyramid is our differentiated path forward built on the foundation of safety with well-understood and well-managed wildfire-related physical and financial risk. Our simple affordable model delivers for customers and investors with room to grow. Ultimately, California's aspiration for an electrified economy at a lower societal cost is our destination and we are well on our way. This is a winning proposition for our customers, for the state of California, and for you, our investors. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Well, that's a great question. Obviously undergrounding is top of mind and I'll open by saying we continue to see undergrounding as a critical element of our total layers of protection. It's one of the layers and one of the most important layers in our highest risk, most vegetation dense areas. So we definitely stand by our commitment to underground our highest risk miles. As we work through the application process of our 10-year filing, look, we're still working through with OEIS. In fact, there's a public workshop scheduled for today to continue to look at the necessities related to the filing. And so as we look at the timing of that filing, it's going to be wholly dependent on what those requirements are and what the expectations of OEIS require. So given that, we have 1,230 miles approved in the GRC through 2026. And we intend to, obviously, we're on track this year to meet the mileage requirements. I don't see us filing a different kind of filing between here and the filing of the 10-year plan. And so I don't think there will be incremental mileage added outside of either our next GRC or the undergrounding 10-year plan. Those are two good mechanisms. And given the direction of our regulators, we'll use the appropriate one to file for the next range of miles. Yes, well, first of all, our hearts go out to the folks near and around Chico, and we pray for their safety and the safety of our firefighters who are out there doing valiant work. Right now, there are no indications of our equipment being involved or contributing at this time, and there are no anomalies detected on our system at the reported time of the fire start. And one of the things, Shar, that I'll share with you that gives me great comfort, and I would hope that it would give investors great comfort, is we know. We can see our situational awareness with our 24/7, 365 Hazard Awareness Center. We're on the job, and we can see, we know what's happening. We can have boots on the ground immediately, and I'm just so thankful for our partnership with CAL FIRE, as well as our own safety crews that I mentioned in our prepared remarks, and our public safety specialists. They give us a level of awareness and understanding that just didn't exist just a handful of years ago, and I'm so thankful for our team being so ready and on the job at all times. I will offer, you mentioned PSPS. You know, here it is July. We haven't done PSPSs in July before, but we did this year. That's our readiness posture. We've done two small ones. The first one was about 2,000 people. Look, these are -- we've sectionalized our system. We've enabled the ability to very targetedly respond to changing conditions and be prepared. I just can't overly emphasize how important it is that that daily readiness should be reinforced for folks. We have a totally differentiated safety posture here in California, and specifically my team here at PG&E is ready and on the job and partnered with CAL FIRE hand in glove. Thank you, Shar. Morning, Steve. Thanks, Steve. Yes, so I think what's very important is that, and we've communicated this before, that we do have a framework. We have certain guideposts when we consider financing any new capital. One, it needs to be affordable for customers, and then we define that as being within the 2% to 4% of bill growth that we've talked about over the course of our plan. It must be accretive to EPS. And, again, I'll just remind you that our current financing plan assumes issuance of equity and still meets the 10% growth this year and 9% in \u201825 to \u201828. And, finally, it needs to be helpful to our balance sheet. So those are our goalposts. And when you look at our current financing plan, two key elements that we've maintained. It's balanced, and it provides flexibility. And that flexibility, again, is in the ramp-up of the dividend and then the parent debt pay-down of $2 billion by the end of 2026. So when we think about new capital, we, you know, just think about our current financing plan and using that same approach. We're going to be balanced, and we're going to try to maintain flexibility. And so you can assume, one way to think about this is that you can assume that we're going to follow our authorized regulatory structure at the utility and always find ways to make it as efficient as possible by using the parent debt -- on the parent level. So we'll always be mindful of market conditions. We're very aware of where our stock is trading. And we're going to maintain, as I said, that balance and that flexibility. Yes. Thanks, Steve. This is an exciting part of our story. And, you know, as we mentioned in New York, and some people may remember this, right now in our plan, we only have a couple hundred megawatts of data center load growth built into our capital plan. So the cluster study that's underway where we're looking at our pipeline of data center demand that we shared in New York, we're going to make sure that any of that we would add in would be incrementally beneficial for customers, both on cost savings for customers, most specifically. We don't want our residential customers subsidizing the big data center load growth. And so this year that study is underway. We have a lot of demand, as we mentioned. And, in fact, by offering up the opportunity to participate in this cluster study, we've gotten much better visibility to what the real forecasted expectations should be. And so when we complete that study, we'll share those results. But, obviously, that's not materializing in terms of load this year because that's the plan for coming years. On the EV front, EVs continue to sell well here. We're up to now 610,000 EVs on the road in California, in fact, in our service area, up from 580 that we reported in New York. So we're tracking at about 25% of new vehicles sold continue to be electric. And given the CARB Regulation, the executive order here in California for banning internal combustion engines by 2035, we are actively benefiting from the transition. And it's interesting because I know I spend time in other parts of the country, and when I'm there, I don't see what I see here in California, which is an active adoption of electric vehicles and the infrastructure being built out to serve them. So we continue to see EV load growth, and that's, again, beneficial, as we shared, to customers from a cost perspective. Both that customer who bought the EV saves about 20% of their household energy costs because the switch from gasoline to electricity is cheaper, as well as all customers benefit because that's the kind of beneficial load that we love the most. So are you asking, Jeremy, about the regulatory procedures, or are you asking about the actual CapEx? Yes, okay. So first of all, you know, the commission's order to include $2.3 billion of incremental funding is a cap. And so what we do then is we'll make filings that reflect what we actually were completing and up to that cap. So what was really good was that the commission made it clear that if there were incremental demand beyond that cap, which frankly we see, then we can make additional applications. And we'll consider doing that even yet this year to show that when we have real demand that we can serve, we'll file for that and that should give the commission then more visibility into what the actual customer need is. And therefore, that could go above and beyond that $2.3 billion cap. Does that answer your question, Jeremy? Yes, because of the moisture that we received early in the year, the fuel levels are very high. So there's a lot of grasses and then it got really hot. So those excessive fuels got very dry. So the fuel moisture levels are very low. And that means that there is a risk of even, a small spark can quickly move. But let me give a shout out to a couple of things. You know, we talked a little bit in our prepared remarks about our layers of protection post-ignition. And this is really important. We talked about this in New York as well. And I think it's probably a part of our layers of protection that are least understood. We have, first of all, visibility to real-time information about an ignition occurring. And so our AI-enabled cameras can directly alert a first responder. In the past, it took some good citizen noticing there was smoke somewhere and calling someone. If you can imagine, that's a very unpredictable response. Our AI cameras now enable very predictable response. Our Hazard Awareness Center is monitoring those cameras. They see it. They confirm that first responders have been notified. And then our safety infrastructure preparedness teams are out there, protection teams are out there, often on the site nearly as quickly as our first responders. We are our own first responders protecting our assets. So then you combine that with CAL FIRE. And there's a couple stats I'd love to share about CAL FIRE that might surprise you. First of all, kudos to California and California policymakers and our governor for continuing to fund the importance of these first responders. So CAL FIRE's budget has tripled since 2015. It was $1 billion. It is now $3 billion annually. And there were no cuts this year, even though there was budget constraints here in the state. Their staffing is up 80%. We have 12,000 CAL FIRE professional firefighters on the job every day, and we couldn't be more grateful for their great work. And then finally, the CAL FIRE aircraft system, it is the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world. We have 60 aircraft that are armed and ready to go. And, in fact, our CAL FIRE aerial fleet can get anywhere that they serve in under 20 minutes when there's sign of trouble. Listen, California's posture is dramatically improved from previous years. This is a statewide effort. PG&E's posture is dramatically changed, but so has the states and our neighborhoods, our communities. And I couldn't be more thankful for the partnerships across the state for all the good work that's happening. So I just want people to understand that when we say California's safety posture is differentiated, we've got lots of evidence to validate that we have the financial protections with AB 1054, but we have massive physical protections that make a catastrophic wildfire very unlikely. You know, we're actively involved in those discussions, mainly providing, you know, insight and experience. Our lawyers and the federal affairs teams are very engaged across the utilities to understand what are the benefits of AB 1054, how could something be structured like that federally. And I would say there's definitely lots of interest from the western states. I do think it's a long put from some of the other states who are not as affected by wildfire to want to support a national solution. But we keep making the case that this is just another climate resilience infrastructure standard that needs to be established and where some states have risk of hurricanes or tornadoes or flooding. Those states that have risk of wildfire need to have a preparedness plan. And if there's a federal backstop, I think that really helps serve the smaller states that don't have the paying capacity and the volume and scale that California has that can deal with a problem like this. Hey, Julian. Welcome back. Nice to hear your voice. So, Julian, a couple things. Number one is my honor to lead the people at PG&E. And this has been the greatest challenge of my professional career. And I'm so happy to be part of the team. On the contract front, there's a lot of work to do. I definitely don't think we're done and nor will we be done in a year from now. We'll work through the contract. But what's most important and the thing that I remind my team all the time is that we're building a system. We've got a performance playbook here at PG&E. We're building a bench. We're building a talent machine. So, we don't have to rely on one person that is the linchpin to the whole program. This isn't a charismatic CEO turnaround that when she goes, all of a sudden, the thing falls apart. My job is to build a system that lasts and stands the test of time. And that's what we're up to. And when I go off into the sunset, it's going to be when I know that that performance playbook is solid and my team is equipped and able to execute the continued service to the people of California at the standards that I expect. And you know what? I'll add a couple of points, Julian, on what it means to add that additional capital. Let's get concrete here on the SB410. First of all, a great recognition that there is such a thing as beneficial load for the people of California. So, our CPC reflected that. We had about $1 billion of energizations in our current plan. So the incremental $1.3 billion is a perfect example of what Carolyn's talking about. In order to fold that additional $1.3 billion into the plan, there's a couple things that have to happen. Number one, we need to plan the work. We need to be ready to do the work. We need to be able to do that work at the lowest cost. We need to see that simple, affordable model actually materialize. We need to see those O&M savings. We need to be able to see efficient financing pathways. And then we can enable that load growth, which is enabled by this very good CPUC directive. So, given that, you'll see in time we'll build out that work plan first and foremost, the most important step. And then we'll figure out how to then get that financing and make sure this is affordable both for the balance sheet and for customers. And this is just another example. I can't tell you how optimistic I am about the regulatory constructs here in California, the enthusiasm we have from policymakers and legislators about the potential prosperity enablement that PG&E has for the state of California. This is a perfect example of how that's coming to fruition in the numbers. Yes, Carly, and I'll just add it. This is Patty. I'll add a little bit of layering on to that. Because how does this work? How do you make it real? We have a waste elimination as our play five in our lean playbook. We've taught thousands of our co-workers about how to see and identify waste. We then have a weekly operating review where we are reviewing people's ideas, a funnel of ideas, thousands of ideas coming through that funnel to determine which ones have the most viability and how do we convert them from an idea into execution. These are bottoms-up ideas coming from our people all across the organization, because we can see that ratio of capital to O&M. They experience the ratio of capital to O&M of 0.8 to 1 in how we do our work, in how work comes to them, in the waiting that they might experience, in inefficient paper processes that could be automated and digitized. Our people are really getting enthusiastic about our waste elimination targets. In fact, our IT department has a waste can award that they present. We're having a good time with this because making your work easier to do, and I think all of us, every one of us at all of our companies, can imagine doing our work more efficiently in some of the laborious processes and steps we have can be eliminated and work can be more fun. You can do higher value work for a lower cost for customers. That's what we're teaching people how to do and systematically teaching it. As Carolyn said, we have some big ticket items, and those are great. We love those as a kind of a priming of the pump, but what we really love is when all of our co-workers are learning to see waste and eliminate it on a daily basis, and that's the culture of performance that we're shaping here. That's what we want to really communicate here on the call. Yes, we haven't determined when we would file, but what will drive that is customer demand. And so as we fill out our work plan, now that we have this decision, we're working our work plan for \u201824. We're already building our \u201825 and \u201826 work plan, and where we see we've got deficiencies, where we've got more demand than the decision allows, then that's what we'll file for that incremental funding. What I can tell you is that we see that demand is outstripping that $2.3 billion, which, again, is another signal of the growth here in California, of our potential for growth. We just need to build a work plan so that when we make that filing, we've got the real bottoms-up demand numbers for the commission to make a good decision. Well, you know, I think, Greg, that Cal Advocates does not yet understand the simple affordable model. This is new for California. This is new for PG&E. And so we will prove out that we can maintain rate increases below the rate of inflation with the simple affordable model. We have all the key components. That's why we're so excited about the amplification of that simple affordable model with more O&M savings, more efficient financing, more load growth. Being able to demonstrate that for our customers is going to take some time. They're going to have to learn to trust that what we say is what we'll do. And so that's just, I just think it's a matter of time. They're forecasting based on previous experience, not based on what we know that we are doing here at PG&E. So far, Anthony, again, heavily weather dependent, our throughput, but pretty flat, pretty flat. I wouldn't say we've seen notable decrease in throughput as a result of electrification, though we've seen it in targeted locations, where we make a decision, for example, I do think PG&E is uniquely positioned because of our overlapping gas and electric service areas. So we're really well equipped to answer these questions, Anthony. But where we see a specific case, for example, we have a mobile home program where if we were scheduled to replace the service lines for that mobile home, we've determined that per mobile home it's cheaper to electrify those mobile homes than it is to actually change those gas service lines. And so in those cases, we're doing what we call targeted electrification. We're doing some other projects where we want to start to show that electrification is viable for homes and economic. And so that's where we're really working to prove out those theories. And so I see this gas throughput change probably in the latter half of our 10-year plan versus so much here in the first next five years. Yes, they're similar across the enterprise. And, you know, we can get into some of those details and get you some more of those specifics, Anthony, after the call. But, yeah, they're pretty similar enterprise-wise. It's predominantly, Ryan, SB410, as well as the OGO approval that we received affected in. Go ahead, Carol. And just to clarify the OGO. Yes, sorry. The OGO is $900 million. The rate base continues. Yes, of course. Yes. Our FPI, we're showing more days in higher risk conditions, for sure. The R3 and above days are up. Yes. And so, and our forecasts are showing because of the fuel moisture levels, until we get, you know, more moisture in the atmosphere, we're going to continue to see those high risk days. But thankfully we are well positioned and continue to have the necessary layers of protection that both predict and prevent as well as respond. And I'm very proud of the team for the progress made. Thanks, Ryan. Yes, typically you're going to get, some of those ideas rolling in the beginning of the year and they materialize in the second half of the year. So that's not unusual. We would expect to see that kind of trend. No, not at all. You know, in fact, let me just remind you. Last year we did 364 miles. This year's target is 250. We still have our, our same process improvements are in place. We've completed 61 miles through the end of June, but let me clarify what that means. We've energized 61 miles. The civil work for those 250 miles as well underway. And that's all the, that's the heaviest lifting that has to get done and the energization quickly catches up the mileage in the second half of the year. That's a very similar pattern to, to previous years. And we are right on track. Yes. Thanks Michael. Thanks Brianna. Well, thank you everyone for joining our call. And I just hope you see what we see. Continued progress on a path to differentiated things. Affordable and a growing company. We're delivering for our customers and then in turn for you, our investors. Thanks for tuning in today and please stay safe out there."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PG&E Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions] As a 0reminder, today's call is being recorded. \n I will now hand today's call over to Jonathan Arnold, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters.\n First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's earnings presentation. Presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures.\n The slide with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We'd also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n With that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe. \nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid progress with our core earnings per share for the first quarter coming in at $0.37. We're also reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $1.33 to $1.37, up at least 10% from 2023.\n And we're reaffirming our longer-term earnings per share growth of at least 9% each year starting in 2025 and continuing through 2028. In addition, we remain firm in our commitment to no new equity in 2024. We're also pleased to share with you our 5-year financing plan, which Carolyn will discuss in more detail. What I want to emphasize is that our financing plan does not include the proposed sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation.  \n As you may have seen, we continue to advocate for the Pac Gen sale with the CPUC. We see the minority sale as an efficient financing alternative while offering significant benefits to our customers, and it would further strengthen our plan. However, as you can come to expect, we plan conservatively, so the sale is not currently in the plan. The key takeaway is that we are comfortable reaffirming our earnings guidance and our $62 billion capital plan with or without Pac Gen. \n Our plan also enables us to grow our dividend payout to a level closer to our regulated utility peers with $2.5 billion included in the plan through 2028. Consistent with our conservative approach, the plan assumes up to $3 billion of equity starting in 2025, likely through a routine utility ATM program.  \n Moving to Slide 4. What I want to impress upon you is this. California and PG&E specifically have a favorable risk profile given significant changes made following catastrophic wildfire events we experienced in our state back in 2017 and 2018. California did the hard work to address challenges to the investor-owned utility model, policymakers passed key legislation. \n Assembly Bill 1054 provides access to liquidity through a wildfire insurance fund with $21 billion of claims paying capacity. Cost recovery under the presumption that the utility's conduct is reasonable with a valid safety certificate, and a cap on shareholder exposure if a portion of our requested cost recovery were to be disallowed by the CPUC. These protections afforded to PG&E under AB 1054 are further complemented by our self-insurance model, which limits shareholder exposure to a deductible of only $50 million, paired with our proven progress mitigating wildfire risk, and significant actions the state has taken to strengthen fire prevention and response in our communities.  \n California stands out as a model for all states that have wildfire risk, and PG&E's operating system delivers the physical risk reduction, which further differentiates our story. In fact, we've reduced our wildfire risk by 94% and are working every day to reduce that further.\n As one additional proof point of our wildfire risk mitigation efforts, I'll remind you here on Slide 5 that in 2023, we reduced ignitions by 68% compared to 2017. And through the end of the first quarter of 2024 on a rolling 12-month basis, our weather-normalized ignition rate remains at 0.93, more than a 70% reduction from 2017. \n As well as our differentiated wildfire risk reduction framework, we also have a differentiated approach for how we intend to grow our customer capital investments while keeping bills affordable. Here on Slide 6 is our simple affordable model. Since its introduction, we have exceeded our annual nonfuel O&M reduction target every year, reducing O&M by 3% in 2022 and 5.5% in 2023.  \n This is new for PG&E, and it will take repeated performance for our customers and policymakers to believe in the benefit of our new capability and what it delivers for customers. As I like to say, performance is power. When we perform, when we keep our commitments, we have the power to influence the perception of PG&E with our customers and investors. We are differentiated in our potential and our system to deliver on these annual nonfuel O&M savings. Time will prove this out.\n One exciting element of our simple affordable model is the opportunity for load growth in our service area. Our electric load growth opportunities are not just electric vehicles and data centers but an eventual and necessary decarbonization of our entire economy with clean electricity as the primary energy of the future.\n PG&E is vital to our state's ambition and the need to heal our planet. 1% to 3% load growth per year in the near term with upwards of 70% load growth over the next 20 years will be required as California moves to carbon neutrality by 2045. California is not afraid to set ambitious targets and has proven repeatedly that we will innovate our way to achieving them.\n Cost savings and loan growth, coupled with continued efficient financing options are how we can execute on our commitment here on Slide 7 to control average annual bill increases to 2% to 4%. We appreciate that near-term build pressure due to consolidated years of GRC recovery and catch-up recovery of wildfire mitigation expense is difficult for some of our customers, and I look forward to the day when we can announce that customers' prices are coming down.\n At the same time, we stand by the need for the near-term increase as this GRC is funding critical work, which is making our customers and communities safer than ever before. \n Here on Slide 8 are just a few examples of important safety and reliability work funded by our GRC. Installation of more than 10,000 devices for situational awareness, system hardening, automation and reliability, repair or replacement of over 175,000 units on our distribution lines.\n Inspection of $2 million and replacement of over 60,000 poles, replacement of more than 160 miles of gas distribution pipeline and under-grounding of 1,230 miles of distribution lines in high fire risk areas. As we perform this work, it is our responsibility to ensure every customer dollar is put to maximum use, which brings us to my story of the month here on Slide 9. \n You may recall that last year, I shared a story on work bundling. Specifically, I highlighted an example of cross-functional bundling where we planned and executed 12 jobs under 1 planned outage. I also left you with a little teaser saying, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Well, my coworkers are now rolling out our next generation of work bundling with something we refer to as mega bundles. \n Using breakthrough thinking and our lean operating system, we've identified over 9,000 individual scopes of work and converted them into 20 bundled projects. With mega bundling, we're looking at an entire circuit as 1 project. In the past, we plan and execute work at a granular level. For example, we roll a truck to replace a single pole or just 1 switch. When we look at an entire circuit, we may find 100 poles that need to be replaced.  \n In Stockton, for example, we have 1 circuit with nearly 1,000 poles that will be completed this year. Bundling these pulls into a single project improve safety, the customer experience, quality, cost, delivery and coworker morale. Imagine assembly line style production, the potential for 1 permit for hundreds of poles rather than hundreds of separate permits as it is today, seeking multiple pole holes per day in a specific region, resulting in significant fuel savings and less hazardous drive time for our coworkers.  \n Framing hundreds of poles at a time using manufacturing style production off-site rather than one by one on-site. And customer outreach to entire neighborhoods, reduced outages and lane closures versus one job at a time. This approach also allows us to negotiate better contract pricing and reduced overhead costs.\n Overall, with mega bundling, we expect to see cost savings of at least 20% compared to historical all-in cost, which will result in at least $20 million of our customers' dollars saved just this year, freeing up resources to do even more safety and reliability work for our customers.\n When I joined PG&E, you may have heard one of my early observations. We're very good at engineering equipment, but we're not very good at engineering our work. Well, that's changing, thanks to our performance playbook. We are delivering improved performance every day, which serves both customers and investors.\n With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn to walk you through the financial details. \nCarolyn Burke: Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm looking forward to covering 4 topics with you: first, our quarterly results; second, our 5-year financing plan; third, our continued execution against our simple, affordable model; and fourth, an update on our regulatory process.\n Starting here with our first quarter walk on Slide 10. Our first quarter core earnings of $0.37 are up $0.08 over the first quarter last year. Remember, that our general rate case was approved in the fourth quarter when we booked the catch-up revenues for all of 2023.\n Adjusting first quarter 2023 for the GRC timing, our first quarter results are up $0.05 year-over-year. This improvement is primarily driven by an increase in customer capital investment. And our CPUC rate base now provides an equity return of 10.7% as approved through the adjusted cost of capital mechanism advice letter. \n As a reminder, we said that we were not counting on this increase to meet our earnings guidance but it does give us more flexibility to redeploy resources for the benefit of our customers. Other drivers include nonfuel O&M savings of $0.01 offset by $0.02 reinvested back into the business to fund more work, such as increased transmission system inspections and electric acid mapping. \n Also this quarter, we revised our estimate for the duration of the wildfire fund established under AB 1054. Based on all the data available to us, including the progress we've achieved in reducing physical wildfire risk on our system, the fund will provide coverage for 20 years, that's up from our previous estimate of 15 years. Another example of how AB 1054 is working as intended.  \n Turning to Slide 11. There are no changes to our CapEx or rate base guidance. Our plan includes $62 billion of customer investment over the next 5 years, and we still have at least another $5 billion to pull into the plan once we make it affordable for both our customers and our balance sheet. And please keep in mind that in 2024, 93% of our rate base has already been authorized with 90% authorized out in 2026.\n This is higher than most utilities given our 4-year GRC cycle, and we continue to pursue cost recovery to increase that percentage. As an example, we filed an application for our gas metering replacement program last month, seeking revenue requirement to support nearly $500 million in capital additions from 2023 through 2026. That's in addition to the request filed late last year for revenue requirement to support the capital costs associated with moving our headquarters from San Francisco to Oakland. \n Here on Slide 12. Again, no changes from what we shared with you on our year-end call. Our operating cash flow grew substantially from $5 billion last year to $8 billion this year. This reflects collection of both our 2023 GRC revenue increase and 2024 GRC revenues as well as the catch-up recoveries of our prior work, including interim rate relief. Our operating cash flow continues to rise through the plan period, reflecting our growing capital investment on behalf of customers. \n In total, we're forecasting $50 billion in operating cash flow from 2024 through 2028. \n Turning to Slide 13. With $50 billion as the starting point, we are pleased to share our 5-year financing plan to support our $62 billion of capital investment. As Patti mentioned, our financing plan does not include the proposed Pac Gen minority interest sale, which would further strengthen what we're showing here.\n Now for the highlights. First, we plan to grow our dividend over the next 5 years. Given our commitment to prioritize customer capital investment in the near term, we anticipate growing the dividend more slowly at the front end of our plan, with the payout stepping up more quickly in the later years. In the meantime, we are benefiting from nearly $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings this year, and we consider this a valuable source of internally generated equity. \n Second, we forecast incremental utility long-term debt needs of approximately $14 billion. Third, we continue with our plan to reduce our parent company debt by $2 billion by the end of 2026. \n finally, we are contemplating [indiscernible] over the 2025 to 2028 planning horizon, likely through a routine ATM program. This supports our $62 billion of customer capital investment and our consistent earnings guidance of at least 10% this year and at least 9% each and every year through 2028. Importantly, our commitment to no new equity in 2024 remains firm. \n In developing this plan, we had several key objectives in mind for our customers and our investors. One, funding the significant safety and reliability investments our customers deserve; two, keeping customer bills affordable, and we gain 2% to 4% assumed inflation; three, delivering on our premium earnings per share growth; and four, achieving solid investment-grade ratings. \n We want to reinforce that final objective here on Slide 14. We're targeting investment-grade ratings at the corporate level. And since 2020, our ratings have improved steadily with all 3 agencies. We're now just 1 notch below investment grade at both Moody's and Fitch and on positive outlook at both. The recent improvements in our ratings are a function of demonstrated financial and operational progress since 2020, especially mitigating wildfire risk. Our 5-year financing plan is designed to build on the progress we've made in all of these areas and reflect our laser focus on improving the balance sheet. \n And as a reminder, our operating cash flow increased $3 billion from $5 billion in 2023 to $8 billion in 2024 with continued growth through the planned period. This growing operating cash flow supports including credit metrics, including our mid-teens goal for FFO to debt. We also generate new investment dollars every year as we execute on our simple, affordable model, as shown here on Slide 15. I'll remind you that in 2023, we realized net cost gains of just over $500 million. mega bundling, which Patti discussed is just one more example of the wealth of opportunities we see here at PG&E to deliver more for our customers while keeping build growth in the 2% to 4% range. \n Moving to Slide 16. Our progress working with policymakers continues. Just during March, we saw a number of constructive regulatory decisions, which together, accelerate well over $1 billion of cash flow. On March 7, the CPUC approved interim rate release in the amount of $516 million, while our wildfire and gas safety cost application moves through the typical process. \n Next, on March 15, the commission's Executive Director approved our request to delay until 2025, $650 million of contributions to the customer credit trust established as part of our great neutral securitization. And finally, on March 20, the commission issued a proposed decision denying the petition for modification filed by joint rate payers to suspend the formulae cost of capital adjustment mechanism for 2024. The proposed decision finds that the mechanism operated as intended, it also offers strong regulatory support for our return on equity. \n In terms of Pac Gen, we continue to believe this transaction is highly beneficial for customers. It has clear potential to lower bill while accelerating our return to investment grade and bringing them a partner to invest in these assets, which are key to California's energy transition. We'd appreciate the commission wanted to take some time from additional time before making a final decision. \n Looking ahead, as you know, the California legislature has passed a series of constructive measures, which have the potential to add upside to our plan and important benefits to our customers. This legislation, including Senate Bill 410 and 84 continue to move through the regulatory implementation stages. Regarding SB 410, our proposed decision in Phase 2 of our general rate case, which we're now calling the capacity phase is scheduled for later this quarter. This would authorize CapEx to support energization incremental to what was approved in our GRC. \n Regarding SB 884 on March 7, the commission approved of resolution establishing CPUC guidelines for approving under-grounding plans. We remain prepared to file our 10-year under-grounding plans later this year when our safety regulator is ready to accept our submission. \n I'll end here on Slide 17, with a reminder of our value proposition: 9.5% great base growth through 2028, at least $5 billion of incremental investment opportunities, at least 10% core earnings per share growth in 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 through 2028. Growing momentum around credit ratings with 2 agencies, Moody's and Fitch now just 1 notch below investment grade and with positive outlook and the continued consistent execution of our simple affordable model, delivering both for our customers and you, our investors. \n With that, I'll hand it back to Patti. \nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Carolyn. As I reflect on the progress we've made over the last 3 years, just imagine our performance in the next [indiscernible]. With the wildfire-related legal and regulatory protections in place and with our physical and financial risk mitigation progress, well understood and managed, we look to the energy transition in front of us and see nothing but opportunities. \n The future California energy system calls on PG&E to deliver the clean electricity of the future. Growth will fuel the simple affordable model and California's economy. We can't wait to share more with you at the New York Stock Exchange for our investor update on June 12. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. \nShahriar Pourreza: Patti just running off on the new financing disclosures. Can we maybe elaborate sort of on the timing of equity needs and the levers to manage the equity needs over time. The $2.5 billion dividend use of funds implies kind of a big step up from the current levels. So is the timing and the amount of the dividend, kind of a lever to minimize dilutive equity? And do you assume -- have an assumption around getting to IG status at the parent as a potential headroom for the equity needs? \nPatricia Poppe: Sure, Carolyn. So I'm going to take that. So thanks for the question. There's a lot to unpack there. So let me just maybe start from the fact that we intentionally built a very reasonable -- potentially built our plan to assume a reasonable balance of utility debt, parent company debt, dividend growth and a routine equity financing. \n Importantly, the plan is consistent with our earnings guidance of 10% in 2024 and at least 90% in 2025 to 2028. We -- as we look at the plan, a couple of things, we will remain focused on accessing the most efficient finance decisions. The plan does introduce a routine ATM program. So in routine, I think that what you can expect from that is sort of a ratable program over the course of our plan. That's the assumption. \n And then on the dividend, we did give you a number of $2.5 billion. And what we said to expect from the dividends is that we will grow it more slowly in the front end of our 5-year plan and then it will ramp up over the course of the 5-year plan. So I think that's how we're thinking about the balance between all of those elements of the plan. \n On IG status, we continue to make good progress there and we can talk about that in detail in a bit. But yes, the plan assumes that we continue to make progress on our credit metrics. \nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just maybe just top level, and I appreciate that, Carolyn. Patti, on just -- do you have any sort of thoughts on kind of the [ Buffet ] letter on sector wildfire risk, I mean, obviously caused a bit of a stir, painted everyone kind of in that same brush. It hasn't arguably helped valuation levels for a lot of the West Coast Pacific Northwest names. I guess it's certainly -- just I guess any thoughts there on how we should be thinking about that because it's a question that we get a lot in [ bounce ]? \nCarolyn Burke: Yes. Shar, thank you for asking that question because frankly, I think [ Buffet ] got it wrong in California. California has done the hard work to mitigate both physical and financial risk. When I think about the physical risk reductions and the wildfire mitigation that we have in place, we reduced 94% of our wildfire risk, and that remaining 6% is protected with all of our situational awareness and the investments that the state has made and CAL FIRE's ability to respond. Our weather stations that have AI-enabled cameras that are often the first notification, the first responders. We used to have to wait for a citizen to notice smoke and call it in. \n Now we have technology that is the backbone of our wildfire mitigations and the incredible work that we're doing to rebuild our infrastructure to the new climate standards and to the new extreme weather is something we're very proud of. But then you combine that with AB 1054 in the financial risk mitigation. There is -- we -- investors are able to invest in California. The wildfire risk exposure for an investor is restricted to the $50 million deductible of our self-insurance. $50 million deductible of our self-insurance. It's important for investors to know that. And the wildfire fund with $21 billion of claim capacity, we just revealed today that we've extended the life of that fund for 20 years, up from 15 because AB 1054 and our physical risk reduction is working. \n So I can just share that, Shar, I think California is very much investable. And I think PG&E specifically has put us in a position, the citizens of California have never been safer from wildfire risk. And I think that investors will soon come to believe that and definitely should not be swayed by a broad brush about all Western states. California is notably unique. \nShahriar Pourreza: No for many of us, that's obvious, but for a lot of us, it may not be so. Thank you so much for the clarity. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. \nSteven Fleishman: On the -- just a clarification on the dividend comment. When you talk about slower kind of early and then ramping up, is that kind of more on a cents per share basis or a percent basis? Because obviously, the dividend's low -- a little bit of increased big percent. So just want to see if you can clarify that? \nCarolyn Burke: Yes. I mean I think our intent is to have a competitive payout ratio over the long term, right? And our financing here with the 5 years is that we intend to make meaningful progress towards having that competitive payout ratio. So when we think about it, you're right, yes, we're going to start slower.\n So we think about it in terms of percent or we really haven't revealed that or talked about that publicly. But I think the key is that we're going to go slower in current half of our 5-year plan because we're, again, committed to prioritizing customer capital investment. And then on the back end, it will go -- it will ramp up more quickly. \nPatricia Poppe: Yes. And Steve, when I think about that dividend payout, combined with our sector-leading EPS growth, we feel that's a pretty compelling investment thesis. So we look forward to layering that on top of our -- already forecast at least 9% EPS growth in '25 through '28. \nSteven Fleishman: Got it. And then a question on the FFO to debt in the mid-teens. With that operating cash flow improving, is it fair to say maybe mid-teens can be kind of a wide range? Is it fair to say you're kind of improving within the mid-teens ratio over the period? Yes. \nCarolyn Burke: Yes. I think that's fair. We've not changed our FFO. We haven't changed any of our guidance for 2024. So we remain on target with our capital investment and our lean O&M savings and our EPS growth and the FFO to debt. And as our operating cash flow increases and again, it increases $3 billion just from '23 to '24, but then you see it continuing to increase, we would -- this is what's driving our balance sheet health and improving our credit metrics over the plan period. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then one last question, just a topic to your data centers. And I know Santa Clara is one of the biggest current data center area. So just -- I think when you came out with your initial plan for low growth, data centers were probably not as front and center of that. But Patti, I'm curious just how you're thinking about that now? And just are you in a position to be able to kind of get them served, so to speak, with power on a timely basis? \nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Great question, Steve. And I'll share a couple of thoughts. One, I think we will definitely be one of the big ancillary winners of the demand growth for data centers as well as electric transportation given our state policies and electrification of the state, the decarbonizing of our energy system.\n But I do want to just tell a quick story. I was -- I had a visit to our [indiscernible], which is one of the critical substations, transmission substations across the nation. And we invited some customers to come. And when I got there, I was pleasantly surprised to see AWS, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Equinix, Cisco, Western Digital Semiconductors, Tesla, all in attendance. These are our customers that we serve who want us to serve more. \n And they were very clear that they would build where if we can provide. And so we're working on a plan that's going to be a big part of what we share in New York at Investor Day. We really want people to come out and see what the future looks like. I'm so proud of this team here at PG&E, who has been able to mitigate the near-term risk of physical and financial risk of wildfire so that we can now play our rightful position in the industry and in the nation as a leader in the clean energy transition. \n Our state has ambitious goals. We're going to be the energy provider to fuel those ambitious goals and data centers are a piece of the puzzle. \n I'll also just add 1 recent publication from CISO shared. CISO forecast an additional 120 gigawatts of clean electricity to be added in the next 20 years in California. That's 120 gigawatts on top of our 67 gigawatt system today. \n That is a 2x increase. And we are going to be the energy provider here in California, the transmission load that comes with that, we're in a position to win on the clean energy transition and so is California. And one last -- this data point I'll share with you, Steve. We forecast that as we decarbonize the economy and reduce carbon emissions by 70%, we forecast a reduction in household energy spend. \n In the neighborhood of 20% to 30%, household energy spend reduction as we decarbonize the economy because electricity is a more efficient fuel than gasoline. That is a win for citizens. That's a win for the planet. And certainly, that's a win for PCG investors. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. \nNicholas Campanella: Appreciate everything on the financing plan. I guess, can you talk about how this kind of takes into account your views on the authorized cap structure and the operating company, just knowing that you have that waiver through '25. Do you kind of continue to assume that you get back to that over time? Or how should we kind of think about that? \nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Nick, thanks for the question. So what's important about our plan is that it solves for 2 things. First is the $62 billion of customer capital but it also does solve for meeting our regulatory and balance sheet targets, including the 52% utility equity ratio by mid-2025, which is when the waiver expires. Does that answer your question? I think so. \nNicholas Campanella: It does. I appreciate that. And then I guess just on [indiscernible]. I think the liability is $1.6 billion, and I'm just thinking about your prepared remarks about AB 1054 framework. And maybe you can kind of walk us through the process of when you file up the administrator or the time line [indiscernible], if any? And how is your going to be thinking about funds potential against that liability? \nPatricia Poppe: Yes. So just to update you on the numbers. So at the end of Q1, we have paid out cash settlements of about $870 million we cannot tap the earthquake fund until we've actually cash settled $1 billion in settlements. We expect to hit that $1 billion over the course of the summer. And we've been having continued conversations with the earthquake authority to ensure that, that is as smooth of a claims process as possible.\n Yes, it's $1.6 billion. A couple of things other to note is that, one, the statute of limitations on Dixie runs out in October. And the earthquake authority actually booked a $600 million loss on their books for payout. And so it's just -- it's very -- we've been working very closely with them. I think we're expecting a very smooth process at this point in time. And I think I answered all your questions there, so I'd leave anything else. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. \nCarly Davenport: Maybe just on Pac Gen. Can you just refresh us on kind of the next steps to watch there? Obviously, you mentioned it got held at the last meeting until potentially May 9. So just what should we be watching on that front? \nPatricia Poppe: Yes. At this point, as you know, we did submit comments and we requested a supplemental phase. And as you stated, the PD is held until the -- at least the May 9 CPUC meeting. We don't know yet whether they're going to agree to our request to come forward with more information, including the identity of our minority partner. But we appreciate that the CPUC is taking more time to finalize this decision.\n And we're going to use that time, obviously, to advocate because we continue to believe that Pac Gen is highly beneficial for our customers. It brings affordability to the bills. It helps accelerate our return to investment grade. And importantly, it brings in a partner who's going to help us grow these assets that are critical to California's energy transition.\n So at this point in time, we're -- we believe Pac Gen is a good transaction. We're going to continue to advocate for it, and we are waiting for the final decision or an approval to do the second phase. I will just add that we provided our financing plan. Again, I'll note that it was without Pac Gen. But with Pac Gen, that current plan would certainly be strengthened. \nCarly Davenport: Got it. I appreciate that color. And then maybe just on the balance sheet, thanks for the commentary before on the FFO to debt levels. Just curious what your latest views are on sort of the milestones or the time line to get back to the IG rating? \nCarolyn Burke: Yes. Both -- thanks for the question. We're very proud of the progress that we've made there and rating agencies, both Moody's and Fitch have us just 1 notch below investment grade and have us on positive outlook. Both have indicated that they're continuing to look at the way we -- our wildfire risk mitigation. And as Patti has noted that we continue to make really good progress there. And so we would expect another action by both of them over the course of the next 12 months.\n And I think they're both looking at maybe another season and our financial metrics continue to improve, and they're continuing to watch those as well. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Securities. \nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to come back to the financing plan a little bit more, if I could, parsing through there. And just want to make sure I understood things right, think about the right way. If I think about the holdco debt, our understanding is it's more of a commitment to pay down as opposed to an obligation, which would seem to imply some flexibility there. And if that is the case, how do you weigh that versus, I guess, equity dilution or even capital deployment pace? Just wondering how this all kind of mixed together. It seems like that could be a lever to reduce [indiscernible] there, Pac Gen doesn't materialize as hoped. \nPatricia Poppe: Again, the plan assumes that does not include Pac Gen. Pac Gen would only strengthen the plan. That's number one. Number two, the plan does include paying down $2 billion of parent debt by the end of 2026. And so again, we are managing a couple of things in this plan. As you said, our capital investments. We have more capital than needs on the system than our plan of $62 billion.\n We are managing the equity -- the utility equity ratio of 52%. So -- but what's really important as we look at equity, I just -- again, we'll say that we will always look to access the most efficient financing alternatives, and we'll be very mindful of market conditions. And so I think those are the key points to be mindful about. Does that answer your question? \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Yes, just curious if I had the understanding of the holdco debt paydown being a commitment, not an obligation. \nPatricia Poppe: P That's right. It's a commitment. We're -- and as we said, we're very focused on our balance sheet health and reaching investment-grade status. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. And then maybe just kind of pivoting here, given continued national attention wildfires and everything that's happened as discussed on the call, could you talk to PCG's kind of leadership role in the industry engagement with peers to socialize best practices? Clearly, PCG has really advanced in this mitigation and wondering how you think about your role within the industry at this point? \nPatricia Poppe: Yes, Jeremy, thanks for asking the question. We feel compelled to play our part. We've learned a lot through some tough times. And so it would be a shame if we didn't share those learnings with others, just like other energy and utility providers have shared with us, and we have learned from them. So we do feel that we can play an important role nationally. \n I do think California can serve as an important model for how perhaps a regional or national solution might be able to be implemented. California has scale on its side so we can have a regulatory and financial protection that goes with our physical protections. But at some of our smaller states might benefit from a national solution. And we certainly will have a voice in that.\n I'm thankful for EEI as a good platform where we work together as an industry. It's one of the things I love about this industry that we share lessons with one another. We've been spending time together in the recent months, learning from each other and sharing best practices. And so we will continue to do that, and I do believe that PG&E and I intend to personally work hard to make sure that the nation learns the lessons that we've learned.\n We've taken a stand here at PG&E that catastrophic wildfire shall stop. And when we took that stance, some people thought we were a little overzealous, but I see that stand coming to life every day. And we didn't say in California or we didn't say California -- or catastrophic wildfire caused by PG&E's equipment, we think catastrophic wildfire shall stop, just like the nation learned to mitigate risk of earthquake and hurricanes, we can learn to mitigate the effects of drought that cause wildfire conditions.\n And so we certainly will be active nationally to help others know. And I'm just gratified by the people of California who have done the hard work to put in the mitigations that exist today here as we speak, that we don't have to wait for those mitigations to be in place. They exist here in California today, and they serve as a blueprint for the nation. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And just want to go a little bit more with that. I guess, on the national level, how do you think about the potential for some national policy here? Conversations really starting, moving in earnest or how do you think about the possibility of that over time? \nPatricia Poppe: Yes. I think there is a possibility. I think one of the things we lack at the national level is a national safety regulator for wildfire. Like we have FEMSA on the gas pipeline. FEMSA did a great job of bringing together all the parties and establishing safe practices that have then been implemented nationwide that regulators can look to and know that their utilities are not gold plating, but their utilities are doing the recommended safety standards.\n We need the same thing on the electric side. So I do think that's something that we're having a lot of conversation about who is that appropriate safety regulator and how do we establish standards because right now, plaintiff's attorneys are setting the standards and they use whatever the highest standard that someone else did, and that might not be the appropriate standard in certain states. And so we want to make sure that the safety standards are clear, and then some sort of national fund makes a lot of sense to us that mirrors the California fund that exists today. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. \nGregg Orrill: Just maybe a clarification, please, on the equity guidance of sort of up to $3 billion. What would change that? Or should we just think about the $3 billion? And then is there -- should we also sort of assume that the FFO to debt metrics continue to show improvement through the plan? Or is there a plateauing there? \nCarolyn Burke: Yes. I think let me just take the second one first, and then we can go back. I think on the FFO to debt, as we mentioned answering Steve's question. So yes, so our FFO to debt does is one, we -- one we're hitting our target for this year. And two, as you look at our operating cash flow, that's where I really draw your attention to. You can see that our operating cash flow continues to improve throughout the 5-year plan. And our FFO to debt is really improving across the plan as our operating cash flow improves.\n So you can see that. Now does it plateau? We haven't given you that information at this point in time. No, the $3 billion in equity is what's in our plan. That is the amount. And how you should think about that, as we've said, is that we will be very mindful of market conditions, and we will always be looking to access the most efficient financing alternatives available to us. And I think that's the bottom line. Is there any other question on that? \nSteven Fleishman: No. Understood. Got it. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. \nRyan Levine: In terms of cost-cutting initiatives, how much visibility do you have in achieving your goals? I know you've been making a lot of progress there, but trying to get a sense of how many quarters or years out you have line of sight to achieving these [indiscernible] goals? \nPatricia Poppe: Ryan, this is my favorite question. Thank you for asking it. We -- I swear, we have unlimited line of sight for places where we can continue to do more for customers at a lower unit cost. And I have the most gratifying visit this week to a place in Dublin, California, where we say we're reinventing inspections, where the team was completely data-driven and focused on how can we do the right inspections that predict the right failures and do the right repairs at a lower cost using technology and process design. \n And it was just unbelievable how fast this team is learning to embrace our lean operating system and our performance playbook our safety management system, combined with our lean operating place and our breakthrough thinking is unlocking extraordinary ideas from this team. And I am so proud of what I see them doing and I can see that we are just getting started. I have a lot of experience in this area, and it has long been my experience that no process is ever finished. That we will always find ways to improve what we do, do it smarter, do it for less, save customers' money while we're improving the service we deliver to them.\n And we are just unlocking that potential. We are in the first inning of unlocking that potential here at PG&E, and it has the opportunity to provide benefits for customers for decades to come. \nRyan Levine: Great. And then one on financing to the extent you're able to comment. So with the stated intention, correct me if I'm not hearing this correctly around a programmatic ATM starting in '25. To the extent that Pac Gen were to be monetized in some way or form. Would that -- is that viewed to be direct offset to equity? Or are there other considerations that we should take in mind? \nCarolyn Burke: Yes, I wouldn't necessarily assume that. I think, one, a Pac Gen approval certainly strengthens the plan. And so it's better for our balance sheet, and it's better for our customers. It's going to allow us to consider a number of different elements in the current plan, but particularly how much customer work we get done, because as we've said, we have more customer work than the $62 billion.\n And we'll also consider our debt financing assumptions. I think what's important, again, I go back to is that we will always look at the most efficient financing, and we'll be mindful of market conditions. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Arcaro: I was just -- maybe a bit of a follow-on that. As I'm thinking about the $5 billion in potential upside CapEx opportunities, how would you think about financing that in terms of potential equity needs incremental to the plan? \nPatricia Poppe: We're -- on the $5 billion. So thanks for the question. So what's important for us on the $5 billion is that it is affordable. It needs to be affordable both for our customers and fitting within our target of bill increases in line with inflation of the 2% to 4%. And then it needs to be affordable on our balance sheet. \n And so I go back to -- our plan has a reasonable balance of the debt, both utility debt and company debt and dividend and routine equity. And as we implement that plan, we will again be very mindful of market conditions and look for the most efficient financing for that $5 billion.\n And David, I'll just add that, keep in mind, things like, for example, a 1% reduction in O&M is $100 million of additional -- or additional cash flow. And so as we think about we continue to do more for less, that frees up cash flow to do more work and pull in additional capital and fund it through efficiencies through some of our more efficient financing. \n One of the things we wanted everyone to really hear today is this financing plan is a conservative plan. It's a good plan. And it can only improve from here. So this is a good starting point, a good baseline, and we're excited to share it with you today. \nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Yes, that's helpful. I was wondering, as we think about the load growth outlook and the potential for data centers, could you speak to maybe just how long it takes to connect a new large load to the system? And any initiatives that you're involved in that could reduce that time and increase the efficiency there? \nPatricia Poppe: Yes, it's a great question. I will say that I think there's a national challenge with the supply chain and being able to access some of the necessary equipment to build out that capacity as well as timely cash recoveries and cost recoveries for that investment.\n We've got the cost recoveries improvement here in flight in California with SB 410. We're looking forward to that process coming so that we can have certainty about the cash flow recovery associated with building out that new capacity. So that's been a delay for -- certainly for some people and certainly for us. But I'd say the biggest delay right now is the supply chain.\n And so we're doing something called a cluster study where we have brought together, that was one of the reasons we had all those customers at the [indiscernible] with us the other day is we're doing a study with them collectively so that they can understand there, instead of one project at a time, looking at a suite of these projects, really understanding their growth forecast, and we can get way further ahead in the planning for their ability -- their plans to build out and our ability to serve that load. \n So we're very excited about the transparency that's being created here with our big customers, so that we can better build out their large load demands. \nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now hand today's call over to Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. \nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Tamica for being our operator today. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're glad that you were with us. We hope that you appreciate the information that we shared.\n We're excited to see you in June 12 at the New York Stock Exchange. We are going to be sharing our latest wildfire mitigation technologies. You're going to meet some of our brightest and best who are closest to the improvements that have been made here, so you can have more and more confidence, both in the physical and the financial risks that have been mitigated here in California.\n And because of that success that we've experienced in the physical and financial risk mitigation of wildfire, we have the privilege of looking forward and planning for the energy system of the future for California. We are proud to be the providers of that clean energy and clean electricity that will fuel the decarbonizing of our nation and our state. And we are proud to serve the role and answer the call from California, and we'll be able to share more with you about our plans in that light and what the growth of PG&E looks like going forward.\n So we look forward to seeing you in New York. Thanks so much for tuning in today. Everybody, please be safe out there. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carolyn Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm looking forward to covering 4 topics with you: first, our quarterly results; second, our 5-year financing plan; third, our continued execution against our simple, affordable model; and fourth, an update on our regulatory process.\n Starting here with our first quarter walk on Slide 10. Our first quarter core earnings of $0.37 are up $0.08 over the first quarter last year. Remember, that our general rate case was approved in the fourth quarter when we booked the catch-up revenues for all of 2023.\n Adjusting first quarter 2023 for the GRC timing, our first quarter results are up $0.05 year-over-year. This improvement is primarily driven by an increase in customer capital investment. And our CPUC rate base now provides an equity return of 10.7% as approved through the adjusted cost of capital mechanism advice letter. \n As a reminder, we said that we were not counting on this increase to meet our earnings guidance but it does give us more flexibility to redeploy resources for the benefit of our customers. Other drivers include nonfuel O&M savings of $0.01 offset by $0.02 reinvested back into the business to fund more work, such as increased transmission system inspections and electric acid mapping. \n Also this quarter, we revised our estimate for the duration of the wildfire fund established under AB 1054. Based on all the data available to us, including the progress we've achieved in reducing physical wildfire risk on our system, the fund will provide coverage for 20 years, that's up from our previous estimate of 15 years. Another example of how AB 1054 is working as intended.  \n Turning to Slide 11. There are no changes to our CapEx or rate base guidance. Our plan includes $62 billion of customer investment over the next 5 years, and we still have at least another $5 billion to pull into the plan once we make it affordable for both our customers and our balance sheet. And please keep in mind that in 2024, 93% of our rate base has already been authorized with 90% authorized out in 2026.\n This is higher than most utilities given our 4-year GRC cycle, and we continue to pursue cost recovery to increase that percentage. As an example, we filed an application for our gas metering replacement program last month, seeking revenue requirement to support nearly $500 million in capital additions from 2023 through 2026. That's in addition to the request filed late last year for revenue requirement to support the capital costs associated with moving our headquarters from San Francisco to Oakland. \n Here on Slide 12. Again, no changes from what we shared with you on our year-end call. Our operating cash flow grew substantially from $5 billion last year to $8 billion this year. This reflects collection of both our 2023 GRC revenue increase and 2024 GRC revenues as well as the catch-up recoveries of our prior work, including interim rate relief. Our operating cash flow continues to rise through the plan period, reflecting our growing capital investment on behalf of customers. \n In total, we're forecasting $50 billion in operating cash flow from 2024 through 2028. \n Turning to Slide 13. With $50 billion as the starting point, we are pleased to share our 5-year financing plan to support our $62 billion of capital investment. As Patti mentioned, our financing plan does not include the proposed Pac Gen minority interest sale, which would further strengthen what we're showing here.\n Now for the highlights. First, we plan to grow our dividend over the next 5 years. Given our commitment to prioritize customer capital investment in the near term, we anticipate growing the dividend more slowly at the front end of our plan, with the payout stepping up more quickly in the later years. In the meantime, we are benefiting from nearly $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings this year, and we consider this a valuable source of internally generated equity. \n Second, we forecast incremental utility long-term debt needs of approximately $14 billion. Third, we continue with our plan to reduce our parent company debt by $2 billion by the end of 2026. \n finally, we are contemplating [indiscernible] over the 2025 to 2028 planning horizon, likely through a routine ATM program. This supports our $62 billion of customer capital investment and our consistent earnings guidance of at least 10% this year and at least 9% each and every year through 2028. Importantly, our commitment to no new equity in 2024 remains firm. \n In developing this plan, we had several key objectives in mind for our customers and our investors. One, funding the significant safety and reliability investments our customers deserve; two, keeping customer bills affordable, and we gain 2% to 4% assumed inflation; three, delivering on our premium earnings per share growth; and four, achieving solid investment-grade ratings. \n We want to reinforce that final objective here on Slide 14. We're targeting investment-grade ratings at the corporate level. And since 2020, our ratings have improved steadily with all 3 agencies. We're now just 1 notch below investment grade at both Moody's and Fitch and on positive outlook at both. The recent improvements in our ratings are a function of demonstrated financial and operational progress since 2020, especially mitigating wildfire risk. Our 5-year financing plan is designed to build on the progress we've made in all of these areas and reflect our laser focus on improving the balance sheet. \n And as a reminder, our operating cash flow increased $3 billion from $5 billion in 2023 to $8 billion in 2024 with continued growth through the planned period. This growing operating cash flow supports including credit metrics, including our mid-teens goal for FFO to debt. We also generate new investment dollars every year as we execute on our simple, affordable model, as shown here on Slide 15. I'll remind you that in 2023, we realized net cost gains of just over $500 million. mega bundling, which Patti discussed is just one more example of the wealth of opportunities we see here at PG&E to deliver more for our customers while keeping build growth in the 2% to 4% range. \n Moving to Slide 16. Our progress working with policymakers continues. Just during March, we saw a number of constructive regulatory decisions, which together, accelerate well over $1 billion of cash flow. On March 7, the CPUC approved interim rate release in the amount of $516 million, while our wildfire and gas safety cost application moves through the typical process. \n Next, on March 15, the commission's Executive Director approved our request to delay until 2025, $650 million of contributions to the customer credit trust established as part of our great neutral securitization. And finally, on March 20, the commission issued a proposed decision denying the petition for modification filed by joint rate payers to suspend the formulae cost of capital adjustment mechanism for 2024. The proposed decision finds that the mechanism operated as intended, it also offers strong regulatory support for our return on equity. \n In terms of Pac Gen, we continue to believe this transaction is highly beneficial for customers. It has clear potential to lower bill while accelerating our return to investment grade and bringing them a partner to invest in these assets, which are key to California's energy transition. We'd appreciate the commission wanted to take some time from additional time before making a final decision. \n Looking ahead, as you know, the California legislature has passed a series of constructive measures, which have the potential to add upside to our plan and important benefits to our customers. This legislation, including Senate Bill 410 and 84 continue to move through the regulatory implementation stages. Regarding SB 410, our proposed decision in Phase 2 of our general rate case, which we're now calling the capacity phase is scheduled for later this quarter. This would authorize CapEx to support energization incremental to what was approved in our GRC. \n Regarding SB 884 on March 7, the commission approved of resolution establishing CPUC guidelines for approving under-grounding plans. We remain prepared to file our 10-year under-grounding plans later this year when our safety regulator is ready to accept our submission. \n I'll end here on Slide 17, with a reminder of our value proposition: 9.5% great base growth through 2028, at least $5 billion of incremental investment opportunities, at least 10% core earnings per share growth in 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 through 2028. Growing momentum around credit ratings with 2 agencies, Moody's and Fitch now just 1 notch below investment grade and with positive outlook and the continued consistent execution of our simple affordable model, delivering both for our customers and you, our investors. \n With that, I'll hand it back to Patti. Yes. Shar, thank you for asking that question because frankly, I think [ Buffet ] got it wrong in California. California has done the hard work to mitigate both physical and financial risk. When I think about the physical risk reductions and the wildfire mitigation that we have in place, we reduced 94% of our wildfire risk, and that remaining 6% is protected with all of our situational awareness and the investments that the state has made and CAL FIRE's ability to respond. Our weather stations that have AI-enabled cameras that are often the first notification, the first responders. We used to have to wait for a citizen to notice smoke and call it in. \n Now we have technology that is the backbone of our wildfire mitigations and the incredible work that we're doing to rebuild our infrastructure to the new climate standards and to the new extreme weather is something we're very proud of. But then you combine that with AB 1054 in the financial risk mitigation. There is -- we -- investors are able to invest in California. The wildfire risk exposure for an investor is restricted to the $50 million deductible of our self-insurance. $50 million deductible of our self-insurance. It's important for investors to know that. And the wildfire fund with $21 billion of claim capacity, we just revealed today that we've extended the life of that fund for 20 years, up from 15 because AB 1054 and our physical risk reduction is working. \n So I can just share that, Shar, I think California is very much investable. And I think PG&E specifically has put us in a position, the citizens of California have never been safer from wildfire risk. And I think that investors will soon come to believe that and definitely should not be swayed by a broad brush about all Western states. California is notably unique. Yes. I mean I think our intent is to have a competitive payout ratio over the long term, right? And our financing here with the 5 years is that we intend to make meaningful progress towards having that competitive payout ratio. So when we think about it, you're right, yes, we're going to start slower.\n So we think about it in terms of percent or we really haven't revealed that or talked about that publicly. But I think the key is that we're going to go slower in current half of our 5-year plan because we're, again, committed to prioritizing customer capital investment. And then on the back end, it will go -- it will ramp up more quickly. Yes. I think that's fair. We've not changed our FFO. We haven't changed any of our guidance for 2024. So we remain on target with our capital investment and our lean O&M savings and our EPS growth and the FFO to debt. And as our operating cash flow increases and again, it increases $3 billion just from '23 to '24, but then you see it continuing to increase, we would -- this is what's driving our balance sheet health and improving our credit metrics over the plan period. Yes. Both -- thanks for the question. We're very proud of the progress that we've made there and rating agencies, both Moody's and Fitch have us just 1 notch below investment grade and have us on positive outlook. Both have indicated that they're continuing to look at the way we -- our wildfire risk mitigation. And as Patti has noted that we continue to make really good progress there. And so we would expect another action by both of them over the course of the next 12 months.\n And I think they're both looking at maybe another season and our financial metrics continue to improve, and they're continuing to watch those as well. Yes. I think let me just take the second one first, and then we can go back. I think on the FFO to debt, as we mentioned answering Steve's question. So yes, so our FFO to debt does is one, we -- one we're hitting our target for this year. And two, as you look at our operating cash flow, that's where I really draw your attention to. You can see that our operating cash flow continues to improve throughout the 5-year plan. And our FFO to debt is really improving across the plan as our operating cash flow improves.\n So you can see that. Now does it plateau? We haven't given you that information at this point in time. No, the $3 billion in equity is what's in our plan. That is the amount. And how you should think about that, as we've said, is that we will be very mindful of market conditions, and we will always be looking to access the most efficient financing alternatives available to us. And I think that's the bottom line. Is there any other question on that? Yes, I wouldn't necessarily assume that. I think, one, a Pac Gen approval certainly strengthens the plan. And so it's better for our balance sheet, and it's better for our customers. It's going to allow us to consider a number of different elements in the current plan, but particularly how much customer work we get done, because as we've said, we have more customer work than the $62 billion.\n And we'll also consider our debt financing assumptions. I think what's important, again, I go back to is that we will always look at the most efficient financing, and we'll be mindful of market conditions."

            "name": "Patricia Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid progress with our core earnings per share for the first quarter coming in at $0.37. We're also reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $1.33 to $1.37, up at least 10% from 2023.\n And we're reaffirming our longer-term earnings per share growth of at least 9% each year starting in 2025 and continuing through 2028. In addition, we remain firm in our commitment to no new equity in 2024. We're also pleased to share with you our 5-year financing plan, which Carolyn will discuss in more detail. What I want to emphasize is that our financing plan does not include the proposed sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation.  \n As you may have seen, we continue to advocate for the Pac Gen sale with the CPUC. We see the minority sale as an efficient financing alternative while offering significant benefits to our customers, and it would further strengthen our plan. However, as you can come to expect, we plan conservatively, so the sale is not currently in the plan. The key takeaway is that we are comfortable reaffirming our earnings guidance and our $62 billion capital plan with or without Pac Gen. \n Our plan also enables us to grow our dividend payout to a level closer to our regulated utility peers with $2.5 billion included in the plan through 2028. Consistent with our conservative approach, the plan assumes up to $3 billion of equity starting in 2025, likely through a routine utility ATM program.  \n Moving to Slide 4. What I want to impress upon you is this. California and PG&E specifically have a favorable risk profile given significant changes made following catastrophic wildfire events we experienced in our state back in 2017 and 2018. California did the hard work to address challenges to the investor-owned utility model, policymakers passed key legislation. \n Assembly Bill 1054 provides access to liquidity through a wildfire insurance fund with $21 billion of claims paying capacity. Cost recovery under the presumption that the utility's conduct is reasonable with a valid safety certificate, and a cap on shareholder exposure if a portion of our requested cost recovery were to be disallowed by the CPUC. These protections afforded to PG&E under AB 1054 are further complemented by our self-insurance model, which limits shareholder exposure to a deductible of only $50 million, paired with our proven progress mitigating wildfire risk, and significant actions the state has taken to strengthen fire prevention and response in our communities.  \n California stands out as a model for all states that have wildfire risk, and PG&E's operating system delivers the physical risk reduction, which further differentiates our story. In fact, we've reduced our wildfire risk by 94% and are working every day to reduce that further.\n As one additional proof point of our wildfire risk mitigation efforts, I'll remind you here on Slide 5 that in 2023, we reduced ignitions by 68% compared to 2017. And through the end of the first quarter of 2024 on a rolling 12-month basis, our weather-normalized ignition rate remains at 0.93, more than a 70% reduction from 2017. \n As well as our differentiated wildfire risk reduction framework, we also have a differentiated approach for how we intend to grow our customer capital investments while keeping bills affordable. Here on Slide 6 is our simple affordable model. Since its introduction, we have exceeded our annual nonfuel O&M reduction target every year, reducing O&M by 3% in 2022 and 5.5% in 2023.  \n This is new for PG&E, and it will take repeated performance for our customers and policymakers to believe in the benefit of our new capability and what it delivers for customers. As I like to say, performance is power. When we perform, when we keep our commitments, we have the power to influence the perception of PG&E with our customers and investors. We are differentiated in our potential and our system to deliver on these annual nonfuel O&M savings. Time will prove this out.\n One exciting element of our simple affordable model is the opportunity for load growth in our service area. Our electric load growth opportunities are not just electric vehicles and data centers but an eventual and necessary decarbonization of our entire economy with clean electricity as the primary energy of the future.\n PG&E is vital to our state's ambition and the need to heal our planet. 1% to 3% load growth per year in the near term with upwards of 70% load growth over the next 20 years will be required as California moves to carbon neutrality by 2045. California is not afraid to set ambitious targets and has proven repeatedly that we will innovate our way to achieving them.\n Cost savings and loan growth, coupled with continued efficient financing options are how we can execute on our commitment here on Slide 7 to control average annual bill increases to 2% to 4%. We appreciate that near-term build pressure due to consolidated years of GRC recovery and catch-up recovery of wildfire mitigation expense is difficult for some of our customers, and I look forward to the day when we can announce that customers' prices are coming down.\n At the same time, we stand by the need for the near-term increase as this GRC is funding critical work, which is making our customers and communities safer than ever before. \n Here on Slide 8 are just a few examples of important safety and reliability work funded by our GRC. Installation of more than 10,000 devices for situational awareness, system hardening, automation and reliability, repair or replacement of over 175,000 units on our distribution lines.\n Inspection of $2 million and replacement of over 60,000 poles, replacement of more than 160 miles of gas distribution pipeline and under-grounding of 1,230 miles of distribution lines in high fire risk areas. As we perform this work, it is our responsibility to ensure every customer dollar is put to maximum use, which brings us to my story of the month here on Slide 9. \n You may recall that last year, I shared a story on work bundling. Specifically, I highlighted an example of cross-functional bundling where we planned and executed 12 jobs under 1 planned outage. I also left you with a little teaser saying, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Well, my coworkers are now rolling out our next generation of work bundling with something we refer to as mega bundles. \n Using breakthrough thinking and our lean operating system, we've identified over 9,000 individual scopes of work and converted them into 20 bundled projects. With mega bundling, we're looking at an entire circuit as 1 project. In the past, we plan and execute work at a granular level. For example, we roll a truck to replace a single pole or just 1 switch. When we look at an entire circuit, we may find 100 poles that need to be replaced.  \n In Stockton, for example, we have 1 circuit with nearly 1,000 poles that will be completed this year. Bundling these pulls into a single project improve safety, the customer experience, quality, cost, delivery and coworker morale. Imagine assembly line style production, the potential for 1 permit for hundreds of poles rather than hundreds of separate permits as it is today, seeking multiple pole holes per day in a specific region, resulting in significant fuel savings and less hazardous drive time for our coworkers.  \n Framing hundreds of poles at a time using manufacturing style production off-site rather than one by one on-site. And customer outreach to entire neighborhoods, reduced outages and lane closures versus one job at a time. This approach also allows us to negotiate better contract pricing and reduced overhead costs.\n Overall, with mega bundling, we expect to see cost savings of at least 20% compared to historical all-in cost, which will result in at least $20 million of our customers' dollars saved just this year, freeing up resources to do even more safety and reliability work for our customers.\n When I joined PG&E, you may have heard one of my early observations. We're very good at engineering equipment, but we're not very good at engineering our work. Well, that's changing, thanks to our performance playbook. We are delivering improved performance every day, which serves both customers and investors.\n With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn to walk you through the financial details. Thanks, Carolyn. As I reflect on the progress we've made over the last 3 years, just imagine our performance in the next [indiscernible]. With the wildfire-related legal and regulatory protections in place and with our physical and financial risk mitigation progress, well understood and managed, we look to the energy transition in front of us and see nothing but opportunities. \n The future California energy system calls on PG&E to deliver the clean electricity of the future. Growth will fuel the simple affordable model and California's economy. We can't wait to share more with you at the New York Stock Exchange for our investor update on June 12. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Sure, Carolyn. So I'm going to take that. So thanks for the question. There's a lot to unpack there. So let me just maybe start from the fact that we intentionally built a very reasonable -- potentially built our plan to assume a reasonable balance of utility debt, parent company debt, dividend growth and a routine equity financing. \n Importantly, the plan is consistent with our earnings guidance of 10% in 2024 and at least 90% in 2025 to 2028. We -- as we look at the plan, a couple of things, we will remain focused on accessing the most efficient finance decisions. The plan does introduce a routine ATM program. So in routine, I think that what you can expect from that is sort of a ratable program over the course of our plan. That's the assumption. \n And then on the dividend, we did give you a number of $2.5 billion. And what we said to expect from the dividends is that we will grow it more slowly in the front end of our 5-year plan and then it will ramp up over the course of the 5-year plan. So I think that's how we're thinking about the balance between all of those elements of the plan. \n On IG status, we continue to make good progress there and we can talk about that in detail in a bit. But yes, the plan assumes that we continue to make progress on our credit metrics. Yes. And Steve, when I think about that dividend payout, combined with our sector-leading EPS growth, we feel that's a pretty compelling investment thesis. So we look forward to layering that on top of our -- already forecast at least 9% EPS growth in '25 through '28. Yes. Great question, Steve. And I'll share a couple of thoughts. One, I think we will definitely be one of the big ancillary winners of the demand growth for data centers as well as electric transportation given our state policies and electrification of the state, the decarbonizing of our energy system.\n But I do want to just tell a quick story. I was -- I had a visit to our [indiscernible], which is one of the critical substations, transmission substations across the nation. And we invited some customers to come. And when I got there, I was pleasantly surprised to see AWS, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Equinix, Cisco, Western Digital Semiconductors, Tesla, all in attendance. These are our customers that we serve who want us to serve more. \n And they were very clear that they would build where if we can provide. And so we're working on a plan that's going to be a big part of what we share in New York at Investor Day. We really want people to come out and see what the future looks like. I'm so proud of this team here at PG&E, who has been able to mitigate the near-term risk of physical and financial risk of wildfire so that we can now play our rightful position in the industry and in the nation as a leader in the clean energy transition. \n Our state has ambitious goals. We're going to be the energy provider to fuel those ambitious goals and data centers are a piece of the puzzle. \n I'll also just add 1 recent publication from CISO shared. CISO forecast an additional 120 gigawatts of clean electricity to be added in the next 20 years in California. That's 120 gigawatts on top of our 67 gigawatt system today. \n That is a 2x increase. And we are going to be the energy provider here in California, the transmission load that comes with that, we're in a position to win on the clean energy transition and so is California. And one last -- this data point I'll share with you, Steve. We forecast that as we decarbonize the economy and reduce carbon emissions by 70%, we forecast a reduction in household energy spend. \n In the neighborhood of 20% to 30%, household energy spend reduction as we decarbonize the economy because electricity is a more efficient fuel than gasoline. That is a win for citizens. That's a win for the planet. And certainly, that's a win for PCG investors. Yes. Nick, thanks for the question. So what's important about our plan is that it solves for 2 things. First is the $62 billion of customer capital but it also does solve for meeting our regulatory and balance sheet targets, including the 52% utility equity ratio by mid-2025, which is when the waiver expires. Does that answer your question? I think so. Yes. So just to update you on the numbers. So at the end of Q1, we have paid out cash settlements of about $870 million we cannot tap the earthquake fund until we've actually cash settled $1 billion in settlements. We expect to hit that $1 billion over the course of the summer. And we've been having continued conversations with the earthquake authority to ensure that, that is as smooth of a claims process as possible.\n Yes, it's $1.6 billion. A couple of things other to note is that, one, the statute of limitations on Dixie runs out in October. And the earthquake authority actually booked a $600 million loss on their books for payout. And so it's just -- it's very -- we've been working very closely with them. I think we're expecting a very smooth process at this point in time. And I think I answered all your questions there, so I'd leave anything else. Yes. At this point, as you know, we did submit comments and we requested a supplemental phase. And as you stated, the PD is held until the -- at least the May 9 CPUC meeting. We don't know yet whether they're going to agree to our request to come forward with more information, including the identity of our minority partner. But we appreciate that the CPUC is taking more time to finalize this decision.\n And we're going to use that time, obviously, to advocate because we continue to believe that Pac Gen is highly beneficial for our customers. It brings affordability to the bills. It helps accelerate our return to investment grade. And importantly, it brings in a partner who's going to help us grow these assets that are critical to California's energy transition.\n So at this point in time, we're -- we believe Pac Gen is a good transaction. We're going to continue to advocate for it, and we are waiting for the final decision or an approval to do the second phase. I will just add that we provided our financing plan. Again, I'll note that it was without Pac Gen. But with Pac Gen, that current plan would certainly be strengthened. Again, the plan assumes that does not include Pac Gen. Pac Gen would only strengthen the plan. That's number one. Number two, the plan does include paying down $2 billion of parent debt by the end of 2026. And so again, we are managing a couple of things in this plan. As you said, our capital investments. We have more capital than needs on the system than our plan of $62 billion.\n We are managing the equity -- the utility equity ratio of 52%. So -- but what's really important as we look at equity, I just -- again, we'll say that we will always look to access the most efficient financing alternatives, and we'll be very mindful of market conditions. And so I think those are the key points to be mindful about. Does that answer your question? P That's right. It's a commitment. We're -- and as we said, we're very focused on our balance sheet health and reaching investment-grade status. Yes, Jeremy, thanks for asking the question. We feel compelled to play our part. We've learned a lot through some tough times. And so it would be a shame if we didn't share those learnings with others, just like other energy and utility providers have shared with us, and we have learned from them. So we do feel that we can play an important role nationally. \n I do think California can serve as an important model for how perhaps a regional or national solution might be able to be implemented. California has scale on its side so we can have a regulatory and financial protection that goes with our physical protections. But at some of our smaller states might benefit from a national solution. And we certainly will have a voice in that.\n I'm thankful for EEI as a good platform where we work together as an industry. It's one of the things I love about this industry that we share lessons with one another. We've been spending time together in the recent months, learning from each other and sharing best practices. And so we will continue to do that, and I do believe that PG&E and I intend to personally work hard to make sure that the nation learns the lessons that we've learned.\n We've taken a stand here at PG&E that catastrophic wildfire shall stop. And when we took that stance, some people thought we were a little overzealous, but I see that stand coming to life every day. And we didn't say in California or we didn't say California -- or catastrophic wildfire caused by PG&E's equipment, we think catastrophic wildfire shall stop, just like the nation learned to mitigate risk of earthquake and hurricanes, we can learn to mitigate the effects of drought that cause wildfire conditions.\n And so we certainly will be active nationally to help others know. And I'm just gratified by the people of California who have done the hard work to put in the mitigations that exist today here as we speak, that we don't have to wait for those mitigations to be in place. They exist here in California today, and they serve as a blueprint for the nation. Yes. I think there is a possibility. I think one of the things we lack at the national level is a national safety regulator for wildfire. Like we have FEMSA on the gas pipeline. FEMSA did a great job of bringing together all the parties and establishing safe practices that have then been implemented nationwide that regulators can look to and know that their utilities are not gold plating, but their utilities are doing the recommended safety standards.\n We need the same thing on the electric side. So I do think that's something that we're having a lot of conversation about who is that appropriate safety regulator and how do we establish standards because right now, plaintiff's attorneys are setting the standards and they use whatever the highest standard that someone else did, and that might not be the appropriate standard in certain states. And so we want to make sure that the safety standards are clear, and then some sort of national fund makes a lot of sense to us that mirrors the California fund that exists today. Ryan, this is my favorite question. Thank you for asking it. We -- I swear, we have unlimited line of sight for places where we can continue to do more for customers at a lower unit cost. And I have the most gratifying visit this week to a place in Dublin, California, where we say we're reinventing inspections, where the team was completely data-driven and focused on how can we do the right inspections that predict the right failures and do the right repairs at a lower cost using technology and process design. \n And it was just unbelievable how fast this team is learning to embrace our lean operating system and our performance playbook our safety management system, combined with our lean operating place and our breakthrough thinking is unlocking extraordinary ideas from this team. And I am so proud of what I see them doing and I can see that we are just getting started. I have a lot of experience in this area, and it has long been my experience that no process is ever finished. That we will always find ways to improve what we do, do it smarter, do it for less, save customers' money while we're improving the service we deliver to them.\n And we are just unlocking that potential. We are in the first inning of unlocking that potential here at PG&E, and it has the opportunity to provide benefits for customers for decades to come. We're -- on the $5 billion. So thanks for the question. So what's important for us on the $5 billion is that it is affordable. It needs to be affordable both for our customers and fitting within our target of bill increases in line with inflation of the 2% to 4%. And then it needs to be affordable on our balance sheet. \n And so I go back to -- our plan has a reasonable balance of the debt, both utility debt and company debt and dividend and routine equity. And as we implement that plan, we will again be very mindful of market conditions and look for the most efficient financing for that $5 billion.\n And David, I'll just add that, keep in mind, things like, for example, a 1% reduction in O&M is $100 million of additional -- or additional cash flow. And so as we think about we continue to do more for less, that frees up cash flow to do more work and pull in additional capital and fund it through efficiencies through some of our more efficient financing. \n One of the things we wanted everyone to really hear today is this financing plan is a conservative plan. It's a good plan. And it can only improve from here. So this is a good starting point, a good baseline, and we're excited to share it with you today. Yes, it's a great question. I will say that I think there's a national challenge with the supply chain and being able to access some of the necessary equipment to build out that capacity as well as timely cash recoveries and cost recoveries for that investment.\n We've got the cost recoveries improvement here in flight in California with SB 410. We're looking forward to that process coming so that we can have certainty about the cash flow recovery associated with building out that new capacity. So that's been a delay for -- certainly for some people and certainly for us. But I'd say the biggest delay right now is the supply chain.\n And so we're doing something called a cluster study where we have brought together, that was one of the reasons we had all those customers at the [indiscernible] with us the other day is we're doing a study with them collectively so that they can understand there, instead of one project at a time, looking at a suite of these projects, really understanding their growth forecast, and we can get way further ahead in the planning for their ability -- their plans to build out and our ability to serve that load. \n So we're very excited about the transparency that's being created here with our big customers, so that we can better build out their large load demands. Thanks, Tamica for being our operator today. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're glad that you were with us. We hope that you appreciate the information that we shared.\n We're excited to see you in June 12 at the New York Stock Exchange. We are going to be sharing our latest wildfire mitigation technologies. You're going to meet some of our brightest and best who are closest to the improvements that have been made here, so you can have more and more confidence, both in the physical and the financial risks that have been mitigated here in California.\n And because of that success that we've experienced in the physical and financial risk mitigation of wildfire, we have the privilege of looking forward and planning for the energy system of the future for California. We are proud to be the providers of that clean energy and clean electricity that will fuel the decarbonizing of our nation and our state. And we are proud to serve the role and answer the call from California, and we'll be able to share more with you about our plans in that light and what the growth of PG&E looks like going forward.\n So we look forward to seeing you in New York. Thanks so much for tuning in today. Everybody, please be safe out there."
