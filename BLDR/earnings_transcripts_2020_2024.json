Michael Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource will now provide the company's opening remarks.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. I hope you and your families continue to remain safe and well. With me on the call are Chad Crow, CEO; Dave Flitman, President; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will provide an overview of our record fourth quarter results and full year performance, discuss merger and integration highlights as Builders FirstSource and BMC come together as one culture and company and how we are positioning the company for continued success in 2021 and beyond. Since we closed the BMC merger on January 1, 2021, the results reported today reflect standalone BFS' record results for both the fourth quarter and full year. On the last page of the earnings release, we have provided select pro forma financial information to show the record results for the combined company as though they operated as one entity in 2020. A slide deck and this morning's press release are all available on our website at investors.bldr.com. The results discussed during the call will include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they are useful to investors can be found at the back of the press release and in the slide presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chad.\nChad Crow: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I wanted to start by saying our thoughts remain with all those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain diligent in keeping our associates, suppliers, customers and community safe. Safety will continue to guide our operating strategy. Our thoughts are also with our fellow Texans. It has been a challenging time over the past 2 weeks, and we wish everyone a fast recovery. BFS and BMC together had an incredible and transformational year in 2020. We cannot have done it without all our dedicated team members. They are a true testament of excellence to driving growth while still meeting the needs of our customers in an unprecedented environment. I want to congratulate and thank them for everything they accomplished last year. We closed our merger on January 1 and have formed the nation's premier supplier of building materials and services with tremendous opportunity for continued growth. The transaction allows us to expand our footprint and enhance our local relationships in many of the nation's largest and fastest-growing markets. We are well positioned for long-term growth underpinned by a resilient and expanding housing environment as well as a significant capital base for M&A.  We expect to deliver above-market growth through our shared commitment to growing our value-add offerings which allow us to closely partner and integrate with customers to streamline the construction process. In addition, this larger platform strengthens our ability to create and invest in best-in-class innovative solutions that deliver significant benefits to our customers. Our increased scale, combined with substantial synergies will help drive EPS accretion and robust cash generation, providing even greater resources to invest in innovation, technology and operational excellence. We expect this housing environment to fuel profitable growth and value creation for all stakeholders for the years to come. Over the past several months, Dave and I have traveled in many regions of the country to meet with team members while adhering to our safety protocols. We also held a socially distance town hall in our Dallas office and shared the video with all our team members. The feedback has been very positive. We are seeing firsthand that our former stand-alone organizations share a passion for partnering together to serve our customers, and now we share an excitement about our future opportunities as the new Builders FirstSource. Dave and Peter will discuss the merger, integration and specifics of the quarter and full year performance shortly. However, I would like to highlight the fact that legacy Builders FirstSource achieved top and bottom line results for the full year 2020. Net sales were $8.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $700 million, up 18% and 36% from the prior year, respectively. Before I turn the call over to Dave, I would like to thank everyone who supported me during my more than 20 years at Builders FirstSource. When I joined BFS in 1999, it was, of course, much smaller, having only made a few acquisitions at that time. I couldn't have dreamed that this company would be where it is today, an industry leader, but more importantly, such a special place to work, filled with incredible people and where I have developed lifelong friendships. To all our shareholders and analysts, thank you for supporting our team. I've enjoyed the time with you and hearing your perspectives. Builders FirstSource is in a very strong position, and it's the right time to pass it on. I have total confidence in Dave, Peter and the entire senior management team to leave this company into the next phase of growth and drive even stronger relationships with our valued customers. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Flitman: Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. This is truly a very exciting time for our combined company. And I want to start by thanking Chad for his dedication, guidance and support during this transition. It's been a real pleasure working with you, Chad. Although you'll be around for a few more weeks, I wish you all the best as you enter retirement and embark on your next journey. I will, however, keep your number handy. As Chad said, we continue to keep those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in our thoughts. The safety of our team members, suppliers and customers is our number 1 priority, and we remain vigilant in this regard. As a combined company, we started the year with strong momentum, closing out 2020 with record fourth quarter and full year results at both BFS and BMC. I want to personally thank all of our team members for their hard work and relentless determination during this unprecedented year, which led to those outstanding results. I'll cover 3 important topics on today's call that we believe will ensure that our already very strong performance continues well into the future. First, I'll provide an update on why we remain bullish on the macro backdrop in our industry and our even stronger position in the industry following the completion of our merger. Second, I'll share our new mission, vision and values, which are critical ingredients to our strong culture and I'll unveil the updated strategy of our combined company. Finally, I'll bring you up to speed on our integration efforts as well as the value capture opportunities we are seeing across the combined organization. The homebuilding market remains strong, resilient and growing. And an improved economic outlook for 2021 bodes well for our customers. We are bullish on the pent-up demand for housing amid what has been a long-term shortage of housing supply. Our analysis suggests coming into 2020, the industry has underbuilt since the last downturn by 2 million to 2.5 million units. In addition, the U.S. added roughly 950,000 households in 2020. We believe there continues to be a long runway of underbuilt and demographically fueled growth in front of us. Improving housing starts, historically low mortgage rates and a shift towards single family suburban living are all positive trends that continue to support demand for our products and services. Together, as a bigger, stronger competitor, we are well positioned to capture a greater share of the increased demand in the single family home market. As was the case with both legacy companies, we will remain disciplined in our pricing processes, and we will strike the right balance between profitability and volume growth, especially considering this highly constrained supply environment. We believe the strategic combination of our 2 great organizations is a transformational step forward for our teams, our customers and our suppliers. Together, we have more than $12 billion in revenues and in excess of $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Even with our combined size and scale, we estimate our share in core product categories is only about 10%, paving a long runway of organic and inorganic growth opportunities for us in our $120 billion addressable market.  We will benefit from our leading network of 550 distribution and manufacturing locations that span 40 states. That network includes 46 of the top 50 and 85 of the top 100 MSAs, covering most of the nation's fastest growing regions. We have significantly enhanced our ability to service key high-growth markets in our South, Southeast and West regions, which represent over 3/4 of U.S. single family housing starts and approximately 80% of our current combined revenues. We will leverage the power of both companies' operating systems to extend our competitive advantage of the market.  We expect our scale will yield continued productivity opportunities this year in addition to our deal synergies. We are still in the early innings of this important work in both legacy companies and we have meaningful opportunities to drive productivity and efficiency across the combined company. For those who don't know me, I am relentless when it comes to ensuring the safety of our team members. We have put many processes in place to protect our associates during the pandemic. And I'm also encouraged by the 12% reduction in recordable injury rates for the pro forma combined company in 2020. But to be clear, our goal is 0 reportable injuries, and we have more work ahead of us to accelerate our progress towards achieving that goal. For my second topic, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk with you about our updated mission, vision, values and strategy. A core team of leaders from both legacy companies work together to finalize the mission, vision, values and strategic pillars that will serve as our guidepost as we continue to grow our share of customers in the specialty building materials production and distribution space. On Page 8 of the investor deck, you can see that our mission is to be the best supplier of building materials and services by having a people-first culture that delivers exceptional customer service and innovative solutions to help build more efficiently while at the same time, creating superior value for our stakeholders. Also shown on Page 8 is our vision, which is to make the dream of homeownership more achievable for everyone, making Builders FirstSource the most valuable partner in the industry. And we rely on our values to guide our behaviors in achieving our mission and vision: safety, people, integrity, customers and excellence, or as we like to say internally spice, a blend of ingredients to produce a better outcome. Next, I'm excited to introduce the combined company strategy, which consists of 4 key pillars. The first is to expand our market penetration by leveraging and growing our portfolio of value-added products and services. Second, drive operational excellence to improve our profitability, invest in innovation and provide outstanding service to our customers. Our third strategic priority is to cultivate, build and empower a high performing culture. And the fourth, we will continue to pursue a disciplined approach to strategic acquisitions with many opportunities in our pipeline and one of the strongest balance sheets in our industry. The investor deck has a slide that highlights the details of our strategy on Page 9. Importantly, you should recognize that this strategic framework is similar to one shared by both legacy companies over the past several years, which just underscores my confidence that executing it well will result in strong and sustainable future comp and bottom line growth. We will leverage our significant free cash flow generation to drive growth while preserving a strong balance sheet, enhance our double-digit return on invested capital and return capital to shareholders. We have brought together 2 very strong companies with complementary capabilities and cultures. As we look ahead, I have no doubt that together, we will be able to accelerate profitable growth through our customer-centric service model. Finally, I'd like to briefly share with you how our important work on integration is proceeding. Back in September, we officially launched our integration management office, or IMO, a cross-functional team comprised of strong leaders from both organizations who are responsible for leading our integration efforts. In addition, executive sponsors were assigned to lead the 9 functional work streams responsible for developing detailed initiatives to integrate, optimize and transform the combined company once the merger was finalized. Back in October, we launched an organizational survey for both companies to better understand any culture related issues that might affect our success as a combined company. Encouragingly, the survey showed that the cultures of the 2 companies are remarkably similar. This, along with the fact that most of our associates have been through the integration process before, has given us a high level of confidence that our integration plan will be implemented successfully and on schedule. On day 1 post close, the teams came together to discuss growth opportunities and the many ways our combined company will create value from the merger.  As I said before and firmly believe at the heart of this merger is growth, expanding our geographic reach in a highly fragmented industry, enhancing and growing our suite of value-added offerings and our market position, pursuing strategic acquisitions and giving our people the resources needed to deliver results and grow their careers. Since we closed the transaction early last month, we have been seamlessly executing our plan. The integration is on track, and I feel even better today about our prospects for the future than I did in August when we announced the transaction. Over the next 3 years, I have complete confidence in our ability to deliver $130 million to $150 million of run rate cost synergies and we are on track to realize $60 million to $70 million of those cost synergies in our 2021 results. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I would like to highlight one of our many valued team members. [Beto Valdovinos], a trust production manager at our Colorado Springs location. [Beto] joined the company out of high school. And 19 years later, he is a top operator and a respected mentor. Thanks to his leadership, [Beto's] location earned one of the highest efficiency ratings of any trust plant at our company last year. [Beto] truly grew up in the trust world. His colleagues praise his success through his hard work, dedication and incredible attitude. He is also a leader in safety, taking great pains to ensure facilities are clean and that everyone is well versed in proper protocol. In large part, due to his guidance, the Colorado Springs location has been accident-free for nearly 10 months. Thank you, [Beto], and the many incredible associates who have made the first several weeks of our integration so smooth while continuing to maintain the superior quality of service that our customers expect from us.  It's an exciting time at Builders FirstSource as we execute our strategy and remain focused on serving our customers, growing our share, capturing synergies associated with our merger and driving shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to highlight our financial performance and our outlook for the year.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking our team for the incredible results and focused execution during this unprecedented time. I will cover 3 topics with you today. First, I'll review BFS' stand-alone fourth quarter results, then I'll discuss free cash flow, provide you with an update on our upsized revolving credit facility and discuss our pro forma leverage. And finally, I'll give you the roadmap for how we see the market and our outlook for 2021. Standalone Builders FirstSource had $2.5 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter, a 43.5% increase compared to a year ago. Core organic sales increased by 15%, while commodity price inflation added 26.5% to net sales. Our latest acquisitions completed during the year contributed to a net sales growth of 2%. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 10.8%, led by 16.9% growth in our manufactured products category and 5.3% growth in our windows, doors and millwork category. We continued to experience accelerated and stronger-than-expected demand across the country throughout the fourth quarter.  As a reminder, the fourth quarter is typically a slower part of the homebuilding season. Our gross profit of $669.2 million was an increase of 40% year-over-year. Gross margin of 26.4%, while slightly better than expected, decreased 60 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an inflation driven shift in product mix towards our lower-margin commodity products. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 480 basis points to 18% amidst cost leverage on commodity price inflation, higher core organic sales and continued strong expense control, which more than offset higher variable costs related to the increase in net sales. Adjusted EBITDA grew $147.8 million to a quarterly record of $257.1 million, an increase of 135%. The increase was primarily driven by organic sales growth across all 3 of our customer end markets and commodity inflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 10.2% of net sales compared to 6.2% in the same period a year ago. I'm extremely proud of our team for delivering these very strong results. Our continued focus on and efforts to improve our mix and carefully managed pricing levels supported our record gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income for the fourth quarter. Let's turn to our cash flow. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $260 million, while investing over $260 million in working capital. We also invested $104 million in capital expenditures, including 2 new greenfield trust manufacturing facilities among several growth initiatives. As well as refreshing vehicles and equipment and investing in technology and automation to support operational excellence and increased sales volume. On a pro forma basis, the combined company's operating cash flow was $468 million, less CapEx of $181 million. Last month, we amended and extended the maturity of our existing $900 million revolving credit facility. The amendment increased total commitments by $500 million, up to $1.4 billion in total, while extending the maturity by an additional 26 months. The increase and extension of this facility provides us with an improved capital base that better represents our larger reach and scale going forward. Earlier this month, we gave notice that on March 3, 2021, $82.5 million of the 2027 notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. At the end of the fourth quarter, our pro forma net debt was approximately 1.3x our LTM adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we have no long-term debt maturities due until 2027. Our strong stand-alone and combined results in 2020 demonstrate positive momentum for the new Builders FirstSource and the broader homebuilding industry where demand continues to outstrip supply. Turning to our outlook. We continue to see robust underlying demand in the single family and remodeling sectors. Most builders are seeing increased buyer traffic and new home orders. Our business momentum continued in January, reflecting another month of double-digit sales and organic growth as compared to prior year period on a pro forma basis. Although housing starts were strong in the fourth quarter of 2020, homebuilders continue to experience an extended construction cycle. This shifts the timing of a new start to our sales, as evidenced by houses under construction growth of approximately 17%. We expect this dynamic to continue throughout 2021 until homebuilders work through their elevated backlogs as we see these backlogs providing a strong foundation for our business and the industry throughout 2021 and into 2022. We, therefore, expect net sales for the full year 2021 to be in the range of $13.9 to $14.6 billion or an approximate 9% to 14% increase from our 2020 pro forma net sales of $12.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow 20% to 25% over our 2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA.  As Dave mentioned, we expect to realize $60 million to $70 million of the cost synergies this year. The dimensional lumber index averaged 676 -- $676 per thousand in the fourth quarter and hit 2 quarterly all-time highs during 2020. We have seen commodity costs to remain at elevated levels in January and February, and futures have even reached new all-time highs. Despite elevated levels in 2021, we do anticipate commodity prices to normalize in the back half of the year. As in the past, we remain highly confident that we will successfully manage through the inflationary and deflationary environments and will exceed the guidance if commodity prices stay at elevated levels. Our outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release, including growth in single family starts across our geographies in the high single digits. While demand for single family starts remains extremely high, we believe actual starts will be constrained by material and labor availability. Multifamily starts declined in the low single-digits and R&R growth in the low single-digits. Our free cash flow is projected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million this year. Our significant cash generation and low leverage gives us the ability to invest in growth initiatives and deploy value-creating capital.  Our capital allocation plan includes reinvesting in the business in both growth and maintenance capital expenditures. We also have a solid pipeline of M&A candidates. As you heard from Dave, we believe the long-term underlying industry fundamentals remain very healthy, as evidenced by strong homebuyer demand and continued adoption of value-added products. The factors under our control further support our ability to drive results in this environment. These include continued expense management, delivering deal driven cost synergies and ongoing operational excellence initiatives. With our strong flexible balance sheet position, we have a significant opportunity ahead of us to continue to be a consolidator within our $120 billion addressable market. Overall, the new Builders FirstSource entered 2021 on exceptionally strong footing, and we are excited to deliver another year of record results. So with that, operator, let's open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Dahl: First question is really around -- I am thinking through capital allocation, just given -- it sounds like the integration so far progressing smoothly albeit early days between the combined balance sheet, already having relatively low leverage and then the cash flow guide you're providing, from the slides in here your commentary make it seem like, yes, there's obviously still a long runway for growth via M&A. And in some ways, maybe even more programmatic than it has been in the past. So I guess I'm just thinking about how we should view kind of cadence of tuck-in M&A while you're integrating these 2 companies and then also, given the excess cash flow, how you think about returning capital to shareholders?\nDave Flitman: Great question, Mike. This is Dave. We're excited about the balance sheet, as you point out. And as you heard Peter say, we have a lot of opportunities to invest capital inside the company to support our growth. I love a lot of things about the culture of the 2 companies. The millwork business that we have combined, the trust and offsite component manufacturing. Both companies were investing heavily in those. We will continue to do that, including automation of our facilities. You'd heard me talk at BMC about that over time. Chad and Peter had also talked about that. So a very good alignment around that. And as you think about just from a legacy BMC standpoint, the 150 locations, which are now 550, I get excited about that. I get excited about things like READY-FRAME penetration. And the opportunity to take that across the country and 3 times the number of facilities that we have. So a lot of exciting internal investment opportunities. To your point around M&A, we've got one of the strongest balance sheet here inside the industry. And that wasn't by accident, as you know, from both legacy companies' perspective. And you heard me say in my comments, as excited as I am about our platform and our growth potential, we still have a relatively small share. And this, this industry remains highly fragmented. As Peter said, we've got a strong M&A pipeline. And we're 57 days into the integration. So we've got a lot of work ahead of us here. But you will see us continue to be an aggregator in this industry over time because there's a lot of opportunities to do so, and we're well positioned for that.\nMichael Dahl: Okay. And the second question or kind of a two parter on the lumber environment. First, I guess I'm curious, your margin performance, the margin guide, it's very strong and clearly a number of things playing into that. But I'm wondering, just given the tightness in the lumber supply chain as well as the backlog that these builders are trying to work through. Has the relationship between commodity inflation and margin changed in a way that even in a more inflationary environment, you're able to achieve higher margins than you'd normally expect just given the bottlenecks and kind of the urgency from the customers to get product on the job sites. The second part is just a clarification when you talked about normalization. I think there's a lot of different views on what normal may or may not be, given what's transpired. So any sense of just when you say normal, is that true long-term trend line price? Or how do you think about what that normalization looks like in the second half?\nDave Flitman: Yes. Another great question, Mike. I'll put it to Peter here in a minute, but let me just say, as you've watched both legacy companies execute in what was a high inflationary environment and in '18 and then that deflation in '19 and just unprecedented inflation and supply constraints in 2020. We're -- we've got a lot of expertise around that. And I have the utmost confidence that whatever the market brings our way in terms of the inflation and deflation that we're going to do a great job of managing through that. And I think because of those challenges in the market over the past couple of years, I think we've sharpened our toolkit, and we've got even better at doing that, which is what you see represented in the way we've executed on a margin basis here over the last couple of years. Peter?\nPeter Jackson: And exactly right, the work that we've been talking about over the past few years on pricing management and training within the organization. I think it was true in BMC, just like it was for BFS. It really has come into play as you've seen such dramatic increases in the price of commodities, right? Our ability to react has gotten better. Our disciplines around the management of that has gotten better. And I think you've seen that in the gross margin results. I would also say that there's some truth to the idea that a move that dramatic has forced everyone in the industry to take stock of pricing more aggressively, right? I mean you're -- this isn't something you could ever hope to protect your customer from when you're up 100-plus percent in some products. So certainly a respect for the need to change pricing quickly and we participated in that. And I think we did, as you mentioned, far better than usual as a combination of those 2 factors. As for the long-term estimate, you're right on. We did revert to a long-term average. There's certainly a lot of debate about whether or not there's going to be a new normal. I think that's fair. There are some legitimate questions out there. But at the end of the day, the game of prognosticating commodity prices is not one we really like to participate in. We've proven an ability to make money on the way up. We've proven an ability to make money on the way down. And for us, we think, a modest forecast on normalization in the back half of the year is just a smart and prudent way to communicate the business. And we're just excited about the core, but we think we've got a great platform here and the growth we have for the year looks really fantastic.\nOperator: So we'll take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: I'd like to offer my congratulations to everyone. And to Chad as well in retirement. So I guess, first question, the -- I guess, on the guide, the core organic outlook. It seems like based on all the pieces you've given, you're implying kind of mid- single-digit organic growth within the 9% to 14% total. Peter, you mentioned completions and units under construction, really ramping. I think you said 17%. And you even gave a little bit of view into '22, just in terms of confidence of having some builder backlogs driving that. So I'm just trying to reconcile that versus the mid-single-digits. And is the expectation, I guess, cadence wise that the growth should be sort of flat or even down into the second half of the year?\nDave Flitman: Great question, Matt. And I'll just say to Peter's comments earlier during the prepared remarks, there's been an increasing challenge here to go from start to completion based on what's been going on in the supply chain. As you look at lumber, we just talked about lumber, OSB is as tight as it's ever been, even getting windows and doors, and we've all talked about a lot of those challenges in the past. And the result of that has been just extension of the time from start to completion of the home.  Now having said that, we're projecting starts in the mid upper single-digits. We are going to capture absolutely as much of the core organic growth that can possibly be had here. We're well positioned for it. Our customers have large backlogs, which underscores the confidence that Peter outlined in terms of our performance throughout 2021 and even into 2022, given the reality of where we are in the market. And many of these product categories not improving from a capacity standpoint anytime soon. So we've got a lot of confidence in our performance. As you've seen, you heard Peter talk about double-digit core organic growth here to start 2021. And we're going to outperform the market regardless of what's going on.\nPeter Jackson: And like you said, the comps do get more challenging in the back half of the year, but I just want to reiterate, our assumptions around both commodities and single family starts are but our attempt to give you a modest and reasonable, a thoughtful look at what we think the market can do, given the dynamics at play. If the market does better than that, we're going to do better than that. No hesitation in saying that. We're just trying to give you what we think is a thoughtful view. We're certainly very bullish on the overall strength of demand. This is not a demand commentary. We think consumers are strong. Trends are solid. We like what we're seeing, and that's sort of the hint you saw for 2022. The inability to deliver on the products that demand is asking for. Is really just an extension of the build cycle, and we think that bodes very well for us and for the industry.\nMatthew Bouley: Perfect. No. And I appreciate the assumption there around normalization and commodity and even the market as well as potentially leaving some room for upside if things stay elevated. So that is helpful. I guess the second question is on value-added and manufactured products, in particular, you talked about the really strong organic results there. It did accelerate after the past couple of quarters. And then Dave, you even just mentioned the expansion of READY-FRAME across the BLDR footprint. So I guess the question is just kind of linking those together. What's -- what are you seeing in manufactured products today? And then now that you've hit the gas pedal on the integration, what are some of the things we should look for in terms of expanding products nationally?\nDave Flitman: A great question. I'm excited about it. As you watch both legacy companies performed here over the last couple of years, you saw continued penetration in leading the market down the value-added path. And I think in large part, driven by the needs of our customers. They're continuing to look for ways to get more efficient and productive, and that plays perfectly into our value-added offerings. And I think that was only exasperated here in the past 6 to 9 months based on the strength of the market, some of the supply chain challenges. So these builders need to get more effective of what they do, and we're pleased to have the offerings that we do. So we expect continued strong organic growth and penetration of the markets and especially in markets that haven't historically been a component market. We think the time is right now, labor constraints are still very real, and I think we'll continue to fight those sort of challenges. And to your question around what to expect going forward, I think we've talked about our first priority here going forward is to invest in the strong growth opportunities that we have inside the company. And I'm not any more excited about any of that than on our value-added offerings, including READY-FRAME. And so that's what I think you can expect going forward, which is a lot more of the same and the wherewithal to continue to accelerate that growth.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: Congrats on a strong start. Maybe just coming back to READY-FRAME. Is there a way to kind of -- and I'm not looking for exact numbers, but is there a way to kind of size what kind of opportunity you have there to grow. And would that require any additional investments from your side to be able to capture that growth?\nDave Flitman: Yes, great question. And I can talk about READY-FRAME for a long time because in legacy BMC we were continuing to invest in it, and we're excited about the growth, which, as we've talked about over the past couple of years have been from a house penetration standpoint in the double-digit growth arena. I would just tell you, in legacy BMC in the fourth quarter, that house penetration was nearly 20% as we continue to grow strength and momentum. And really exciting part about READY-FRAME and that investment to your question is it's a relatively minor investment. We're talking about saws and some computer aided design and capability. But it's a relatively minor investment to extend that across the markets. And it is in large part driven by the know-how of our people, right, to not only design the homes and put that in a READY-FRAME model, but also how we deliver it to job sites and unload it in a way that's very effective for the framer, so they can do their work most efficiently. So a minor investment as we expanded to new markets, and we will continue to be aggressive at doing that.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe can you talk about sort of any disruptions from some of the recent storms that you've had in Texas? How you are kind of managing, given what has happened?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. No, that's a great question. It's been a difficult time, obviously, not just for us, for the whole state. We had some interruption. As you might imagine, we had some shutdowns. The initial read is that it's probably around $40 million in sales that were delayed as a result of those shutdowns. We'll see how it plays out through the rest of the quarter. For a company of our scale, obviously, that's not material, but it's impactful to the folks in the state. So we've done some work with our employees to make sure we're supporting them and those that were impacted, and we're continuing to bring all of our facilities back up and candidly, they're running quite well. Now as you can imagine, there's a lot of pent-up demand. There was any way in a very, very busy market and they're rolling hot right now. It's fun.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. Understood. I'll turn it over. Good luck through 2021.\nDave Flitman: Do we think it's going to last through 2021? Is that your question?\nKetan Mamtora: All I said was good luck as we move through the year.\nDave Flitman: Oh, good luck. I apologize. Yes, thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: So we are guiding to approximately $135 million in total quarterly depreciation and amortization. I assume that most of that resides in SG&A in your combined P&L. Is there a piece of that depreciation that resides in cost of goods sold first off?\nPeter Jackson: There is a little bit, yes, attributable to the manufacturing facilities.\nDavid Manthey: And breaking their bread box, less than 10% of it?\nPeter Jackson: That's a great question. I don't know we've ever broken that out before. I don't have it handy on me.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And what I'm getting at here is, I'm thinking about total SG&A with or without D&A as a fixed component of your operating expenses, could you remind us what percent of the combined company SG&A is fixed versus variable in the very short-term?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I mean we generally talk about it is about 70% variable. So most of that cost moves with the increasing and decreasing volumes. It's a bit less than that when we talk about the commodity influence component of growth, but certainly, the bulk of what we do is moved by the volumes.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And D&A would be a portion of that 30%?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, yes. And as we finish the purchase accounting, we'll have some updates for you on sort of what the dollars are going to be in those buckets. But as it stands, that's still a work in progress.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. We're just trying to work through the pro forma this year. And then in terms of working capital, is your goal still to remain in that 12% to 13% of sales range? And here, too, just to be clear, could you give us how you define working capital for that calculation?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So that 12% to 13% is not familiar to me. Maybe that was on the BMC side. The number we've used in the past is closer to 8% to 9%. That's a number that includes the receivables, inventory and payables amounts. Now obviously, that's gone down over time. And we'll move as we look at the valuation of commodities in the current numbers. But just as a rule of thumb, that 8% to 9% as an incremental percentage vis-\u00e0-vis sales is the right way to think about it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies.\nCollin Verron: So I just wanted to start on the EBITDA margin expansion. The guidance implies about 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. I was just hoping you can walk us through how this might show up on your P&L, gross profit or SG&A? And just given where lumber is now and the capturing of synergies, can you just talk about the cadence of this improvement throughout the year?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yes. So the -- generally speaking, we talk about the fall-through on our incremental sales in that 12% to 15% range. Obviously, you'll see certain movements that will go above or below that. But there's a good rule of thumb for how our business grows over time. So that fall through, as you see the expansion, both in the underlying volume and in the commodities throughout the year, this year will fall through, and you'll see that gross margin then translate as we talk about the volume -- impact on SG&A will translate down into that EBITDA number. So to think about it more broadly, we like high prices. As a distributor, this is certainly a very good season for us, if you will, in terms of the prices we're seeing and the growth, the leverage of our business is quite strong, as you can imagine. So that's the reason that's driving that fall-through to those very high numbers. We also do expect to see an increasing generation of synergies throughout the year as well as an increase in generation of productivity savings and improvements throughout the year. I don't know if I would say it's a straight-line increase, but for the purposes of this discussion, that's a reasonable way to look at it.\nCollin Verron: Okay. Great. And just on the lumber prices being at all-time highs, there's been a lot of headlines just about the impact on home prices and the ability of buyers to get appraisals. It doesn't seem to have an impact in the near term, but have you heard from any of your customers that things could slow down as we start to look out like 6 months to a year if lumber prices don't normalize? Or do they just think that the low interest rates and the underlying fundamentals in the industry from a demographic standpoint can really sustain this even in this high lumber price environment?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I think it's far more the latter. The demand is so strong. The problem is our ability to build the homes that people want as an industry. So while there could be on the edges, some headwinds, but framing really isn't anywhere near an important part -- an important part of the cost of the home as many other factors. So sure, there's a component there is inflation in a couple of other areas that in the long term, may drive demand down. But at this stage, I'm not sure we're going to be able to see it and as time passes, I think we'll be able to fix some of the constraints in the industry that will normalize that as well, which I think will then feed back into a stronger demand profile as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist.\nKeith Hughes: On the D&A estimate you have for the year, the $540 million to $550 million, how much of that is deal amortization? How much of it is just more traditional depreciation?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Well, I mean, like I mentioned, it's still a work in progress, but a pretty substantial step-up on the purchase accounting, as you can imagine, right? That will burn off over a few years. But as it relates to the valuations that we'll do as part of that purchase accounting, we'll see a pretty substantial step up.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. And the -- this was sorted out earlier, but I just wanted to bear down a little bit more. With the EBITDA expansion you have versus the pro forma numbers projected here for '21. Do you expect to see EBITDA margins up in every quarter? Or were there -- the comp in the fourth quarter so tough that we might see some degradation there?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. You know what, that's a fair question. We do anticipate seeing increasingly difficult comparisons as you get through the year, right? You're looking at the beginning of the year last year, pretty modest numbers across the board. And by the end of the year, looking at record commodities, record starts, a lot of records in there, which have been pretty fun, I could admit. But yes, the comps will get harder in the back half of the year. The real question is what happens with commodities and starts. There's the numbers that we've got laid out here would indicate some tough comps, but if things stay elevated, it will stay good. But overall, the year looks great, a lot of confidence in both the overall industry and our performance.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: And congrats to everybody on getting the deal done and Chad, on your retirement and best of -- best of luck to you. So on the first question that I have is, I know your guidance hasn't included, historically hasn't included any sales synergies between the 2 companies. But like the rollout of READY-FRAME to more branches, more of the Builders FirstSource branches. Examples like that, where do you see potential opportunity for some benefits to the top line, sales synergies or whatever you want to call them, where you can benefit from the combined company. Just areas. If I like to say, I know it doesn't -- you're not including it in the guide or in the synergy guide, but it seems like there could be some opportunities. If you could just maybe update us on where you think there might be some low-hanging fruit?\nDave Flitman: Yes. Thanks, Keith. And as I mentioned, we've got -- -- Trey, sorry about that. We've got 9 work streams on our transaction here focused on integration. And one of those is growth, as you might expect. And we talked about READY-FRAME, that we're seeing a lot of opportunities. And as we talked about when we announced the deal, one of the exciting parts about the deal is the fact that we will have a broader offering. And even in the local markets where we're individually very strong, one of the other legacy companies might have been stronger in millwork versus components. And as we brought this thing together, we're very excited about half in that full breadth of offering across the footprint. So we're seeing a lot of opportunities like that in terms of growth potential across our value-added segments with several others. But it's early days. The team is working hard on it, and we're very excited about it.\nTrey Grooms: Thanks, Dave. And then last one for me is there's -- you mentioned earlier in the comments that there could be some inflation in some other areas. And of course, there's tightness in a lot of the different products out there outside of lumber. And a lot of manufacturers of these products are out with price increases from wallboard to interior doors and roofing and insulation. How are you guys looking at the inflation outside of lumber for this year relative to what we've seen in the last couple -- do you expect that to accelerate? Just what are you baking in there?\nDave Flitman: Yes, we do. There's certainly been enough increases across the board from different vendors that I think to think otherwise would be misinformed. There are a lot of reasons for it. Some of it is inputs. Some of it is cost of doing business. The other is, I think, just the recognition that we're chasing a nice strong number and capacity in the market is struggling to keep up, so people are trying to balance that price capacity, that price volume metric. But it's certainly something that we -- I won't say we're happy about, it's part of what we do. We perform well in markets with strong pricing. So we are participating in that. We're making sure we stay disciplined about it, communicating with our vendors where we think it's maybe out of line. But for the most part, trying to be supportive to make sure we have an industry that can grow and continue to respond to the demand.\nTrey Grooms: And then last one. Sorry, I said last one earlier, but actually did want to sneak one more in. You guys talk about commodity normalizing in the back half. And you've got a range here with your EBITDA range with the margins there. How would that look? This commodity has surprised everybody, I\u2019d say, well, maybe not everybody, but most folks, the way that it's as resilient stayed up as high as it has through the winter and then has accelerated. So if we don't see -- if the commodity doesn't normalize in the back half, how does that change your outlook?\nDave Flitman: Hey, Trey, good and important question. Let me start, and then I'll flip it over to Peter. But I think for a number of reasons, I think the lumber questions here are starting to become less and less important, especially in our combined company. First of all, as we've talked about, we're both expert in managing through this cycle. And as you heard us say earlier, we're real confident in our ability to do that regardless of what the market throws at us. And a lot of the things that we talked about that we're excited about here being -- having the largest footprint in our industry. Here a broadest portfolio of products. The geographical reach with 550 locations, 85 of the top 100 MSAs and importantly, as you look at our millwork and components business, that's more than $5 billion of the combined company revenues right now, and they're the fastest-growing in the company. So linked back to our strategy, growing those value-added components will be an important part of how we grow the company and how we continue to improve profitability, not that lumber won't be an important part of what we do, and it always will be. But it's going to have less and less of an impact than what we do over time, right? And so I just want to get everybody's head calibrated. That's one of the most exciting parts about this merger. And I would just say, we've got to stop thinking about what we're building here as a lumber distributor, right? We are a growth company and a fast-growing one at that. And I think time will prove that out as we go forward and drive this growth in areas that are non-commodity related. But Peter, go ahead.\nPeter Jackson: Yes, no, great point. And we're -- we do pretty well at lumber too which is, I think the right way to think about it, right, maybe will be the core of where we're headed, but we do well at it. And the short answer to your question, Trey, is you're right on. It is going to be a really nice tailwind if it stays high, based on the guide that you would get because the math will show, right? You got a first half growth, second half headwind. If you look at just the math of the commodities, I mean, you take away the second half headwind, that's a great story. We'll look forward to enjoy that business, if you're right.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Reuben Garner with Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner: Most of my questions have been answered. I guess just one kind of more macro level picture. In the past, BMC has been one to highlight the kind of falling footprint and the size of homes that are being built whether it's because of new entry homes or just smaller homes in general. And I think there have been some signs, but that might be reversing. Are you guys seeing anything there? What's kind of baked in your guidance if I missed it, apologies, but any color you could give on that, that would be great?\nDave Flitman: Yes, we can tag the team. I mean as you point out, that Reuben, I mean the average square foot of the home has continued to fall. And I think that's accelerated over the past couple of years just based on the entry-level or first time step up buyers. I think we're somewhere around 2,300 square feet at this point for the average home size. But as you've heard me say in legacy BMC, I don't really get concerned about the size of the home as long as it continues to fuel growth, right, in the industry. And I haven't met a start. I don't like yet at this point. So as long as that holds up and continues to fuel growth, we're going to continue to penetrate with our value-added offerings.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. And I think what you might be alluding to is the rumor and the rumblings that people are -- that might turn, right? We're seeing folks that are more committed to the homes that they're sort of stuck in, right. So they like it a little bit bigger, they want that office where they can close the door, for example. So there's, I think, reason to believe that we may see the end of that shrinking of the home. I've seen no data yet, but I think it's reasonable to think that's a real thing. And that will just sort of take away one of the little headwinds we were seeing in the industry and be a stabilizing factor. To Dave's point, though, we could still see an average decline just because I think the growth of the single-family starter home has been so strong, which is great for us, right? It's just a win for everybody.\nReuben Garner: Perfect. And then actually, I might sneak one more in. The cash flow that you're generating is obviously very strong, and the balance sheet is in great shape. I think you kind of touched on this earlier, but can you just maybe emphasize what -- if you're not able to get enough deals done, I guess, as a use of cash, what you might do with the excess as you move forward, do you continue to build a fortress? Or do you think you'll get more aggressive in other ways to either return cash to shareholders or invest in the business?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. We've got a really nice position, like you said. Our debt, as the leverage ratio based metric is quite low. We feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and tend to maintain that as a priority. Moving into the investment opportunities, Dave alluded to it, and I think we all feel good about it. As we get to the cash generation point in our year we\u2019ll have gotten through a lot of the initial stress of the integration and be in a stronger position to really be aggressive on some of those M&A opportunities that are out there, we really like the portfolio. I think we have a lot of runway in front of us to consolidate the industry. And the short answer, if for whatever reason, all of those things don't use up the cash. Sure, the options are open, right? You've seen both companies buy back shares in the past, and we'll look at it. But right now, we feel like we've got -- the sites are full with great targets.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless : And Chad, all the best, enjoy your retirement. Peter, on the lumber guidance. I'm just wondering, are you guys thinking that revenues -- total revenues first half may actually be a little bit higher this year than revenues in the second half as lumber prices start to fall back down? And then also, are you hearing or seeing capacity increases or, I guess, capacity utilization getting better at your suppliers to have that kind of confidence for lumber just to be up 0% to 10% this year?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, I don't think the commodity is strong enough to skew sales from second half to first half. I think, I mean, second half is historically stronger, so I think we should continue to see that. I mean the answer on the commodity capacity question, it's a good one. I mean, I'm up 2 minds, right? On one hand, some capacity coming online doesn't appear to be enough to pull the rug out from under it. But the counter to that argument of sort of bullishness on prices is that historically, this is not an industry that's held price. Just isn't. So I don't know that I want to be the guy to put my foot down and say, yes, this time, it's different. I haven't seen any evidence to prove that. So we're going to continue to put that sort of modest sort of reasonable number out there. And if it's better, then it will be good.\nJay McCanless: Got it. And then another question I had, very strong results in multifamily in the fourth quarter, but then you're calling for multifamily to be down in '21. Is what we saw this quarter, just kind of finishing out some of those larger projects that were started in '19, and that project activity is going to flow from here?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I mean, in context, multifamily is about 6% of our business. So it's pretty specifically focused on certain geographies and certain projects. There is a bit of exactly what you described, projects that sort of are concluding, and the pipeline will still good. Looks to be maybe not as much of a positive a contributor as it was last year where the team really sort of did a really nice job of expanding our capacity, that gets a little harder in this environment. I think we've all seen multifamily struggle a bit. We feel good about the business. We think there's still a growth opportunity there, but just sort of line of sight thinking it\u2019s going to moderate a bit.\nOperator: We'll go next to Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.\nAlex Rygiel: Real quick question. As it relates to your free cash flow forecast, which is fantastic, how should we think about working capital changes relative to the anticipation of commodity prices coming back down to sort of normalized levels. I guess the question here is, how much did that free cash flow forecast vary depending on commodity prices?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. You nailed it, that's a great question. The short answer is our business being distribution based is going to generate a tremendous amount of cash as sales decline, and that includes the value of commodities and any sales decline associated with that. So certainly do expect, given our stated belief or stated forecast, rather, that the commodity prices are going to come down. There is a component in there. It's unfortunately, it's a little bit hard to put your finger on it. But to put it in context, we talked about the increase in working capital usage in 2020. And being about $260 million in our prepared remarks. So just to kind of put it in context that, that's directionally the types of numbers you'd expect to see when extrapolating that to the larger entity for a full switch back to sort of historical.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.\nKurt Yinger: Just one quick one on the capital spending side. Could you talk about any kind of notable projects you have slated for 2021 here? And as you think about your capacity at present, particularly on the manufactured product side, how do you feel about your ability to supply increasing levels of demand as the market grows and perhaps those products continue to gain adoption?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. You -- I think you've been peaking into my ops reviews. So that's a good one there. We've got obviously a lot of facilities around the country right now that are focused on meeting the increased demand. A couple of factors there, obviously, hiring, being an important one, making sure we're running all the ships we can, utilizing equipment fully and in markets where even that's not enough, making sure we're bringing in the increased capacity on the equipment side that we need. So we talked a little bit earlier about the ability and the willingness and the desire to invest in organic growth for the company. That's the sort of tip of the spear, right? It's how do you react to make sure you've got the right trust equipment, door machines, saws, computer equipment to be able to chase that expanding use of value-add while continuing to invest in the trucks and the core operations that we need. But you're absolutely right. We're focused on making sure we're reacting in those markets that are white hot to have the capacity that we need. And it's a high-quality challenge, right, a high quality problem.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsey: Quick question on the margin guide, maybe a misunderstanding. It looks like the high end implies margins not stepping up with increased sales. If we're matching the high end of both sales and EBITDA guidance, new to lumber, are there any other factors there driving that?\nPeter Jackson: I don't know if I can point to a specific driver. I think you might be just seeing the impact of multiple variables and low end of the range. Commodity is absolutely growth in various regions and the variables we put around that. So I don't know that I have a hard answer for you.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay. Great. And then one other thing. Not trying to get into specific guidance, but just qualitatively, starts time extending between starts to completion. Is it factored into revenue generation for 2021, but maybe help support demand out into 2022 if this dynamic continues through the year?\nPeter Jackson: That's right. Yes. We generally tell everyone that the best proxy for our long-term growth is that single-family starts metric, and it's true. The challenges with an extension of that build cycle, you start to get a little bit of wiggle, right, that look is coming and it\u2019s a little harder to draw the line. So we just wanted to point that out everybody to say it's still the right number, but it will extend the time that we'll be able to enjoy the upside if that expansion of homes under construction continues out for a while, we think that that\u2019s going to happen. So '21 into '22 and then as things -- as we expect, continue to be strong, that gives us a nice runway. So yes, you're right.\nOperator: Our final questions from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.\nRyan Gilbert: First question, Dave, I really appreciate your comments earlier about, over time, lumber being no less important component of BFS' story as the value-add piece of the business grows. But for the -- I think for the time being, it's still a relatively important piece of the story. So my first question is on lumber. And just given the strength of demand that we've seen from homebuilders as you're writing fixed-price contracts with the builders, are you noticing the length of time, that you're fixing lumber prices compressing in the fourth quarter and so far in '21?\nPeter Jackson: So one of the things that has been a discussion in both fixed-price contracts and the appropriateness of them in light of the market and the market dynamics. Our observation is those appear to be falling as a percentage of the total, just given the way the market has evolved over the years. There's certainly something that, as you can imagine, we manage very closely to make sure people are living up to their commitments. We live up to ours as a partner in this industry. We've got the financial wherewithal to do what is right, no matter what, but also making sure that both sides are living up to it. So that's something we're careful with. But more broadly, it's about the relationship with the customer and working with them in a way that's obviously good for the end customer and mutually beneficial and watching the evolution of the industry, it appears that, that is something that's declining overall, but still an important material part of our business.\nRyan Gilbert: Second question is just digging into sales synergies a little more. I guess, one dynamic that I've noticed in the field is that a builder would buy like a wall package from BMC or BLDR and buy trusses from a different distributor. And with the combined company, have you seen an ability, are you able to take advantage of, or are you going after I guess, your new ability to sell both framing packages and trusses to homebuilders? Or do you think that's a future opportunity for the combined company?\nDave Flitman: Well, as you rightfully point out, I mean it's early days, right? But as we talk about that growth work stream earlier, we're excited about it. We see nothing as a deterrent in that. We've not had pushback. And in fact, our customers are equally excited about our combined offering in a lot of these markets. And so time will play out. But we're excited, see no roadblocks, and we think the future is very bright to continue to penetrate those markets with our offerings.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Chad Crow for any additional or closing remarks.\nChad Crow: Thank you. We appreciate everyone joining the call today and for the continued support of our company. I'm personally looking forward to watching what this new management team and all of our incredible team members will accomplish in the years ahead. As you heard throughout the call today, there is a lot of excitement around the future of our company. I certainly share that excitement and truly believe BFS is in the strongest position it has ever been. I am proud to have been a part of this amazing journey over the past 2 decades. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Peter or Mike. Thank you. Stay safe, and adios.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. This is truly a very exciting time for our combined company. And I want to start by thanking Chad for his dedication, guidance and support during this transition. It's been a real pleasure working with you, Chad. Although you'll be around for a few more weeks, I wish you all the best as you enter retirement and embark on your next journey. I will, however, keep your number handy. As Chad said, we continue to keep those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in our thoughts. The safety of our team members, suppliers and customers is our number 1 priority, and we remain vigilant in this regard. As a combined company, we started the year with strong momentum, closing out 2020 with record fourth quarter and full year results at both BFS and BMC. I want to personally thank all of our team members for their hard work and relentless determination during this unprecedented year, which led to those outstanding results. I'll cover 3 important topics on today's call that we believe will ensure that our already very strong performance continues well into the future. First, I'll provide an update on why we remain bullish on the macro backdrop in our industry and our even stronger position in the industry following the completion of our merger. Second, I'll share our new mission, vision and values, which are critical ingredients to our strong culture and I'll unveil the updated strategy of our combined company. Finally, I'll bring you up to speed on our integration efforts as well as the value capture opportunities we are seeing across the combined organization. The homebuilding market remains strong, resilient and growing. And an improved economic outlook for 2021 bodes well for our customers. We are bullish on the pent-up demand for housing amid what has been a long-term shortage of housing supply. Our analysis suggests coming into 2020, the industry has underbuilt since the last downturn by 2 million to 2.5 million units. In addition, the U.S. added roughly 950,000 households in 2020. We believe there continues to be a long runway of underbuilt and demographically fueled growth in front of us. Improving housing starts, historically low mortgage rates and a shift towards single family suburban living are all positive trends that continue to support demand for our products and services. Together, as a bigger, stronger competitor, we are well positioned to capture a greater share of the increased demand in the single family home market. As was the case with both legacy companies, we will remain disciplined in our pricing processes, and we will strike the right balance between profitability and volume growth, especially considering this highly constrained supply environment. We believe the strategic combination of our 2 great organizations is a transformational step forward for our teams, our customers and our suppliers. Together, we have more than $12 billion in revenues and in excess of $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Even with our combined size and scale, we estimate our share in core product categories is only about 10%, paving a long runway of organic and inorganic growth opportunities for us in our $120 billion addressable market.  We will benefit from our leading network of 550 distribution and manufacturing locations that span 40 states. That network includes 46 of the top 50 and 85 of the top 100 MSAs, covering most of the nation's fastest growing regions. We have significantly enhanced our ability to service key high-growth markets in our South, Southeast and West regions, which represent over 3/4 of U.S. single family housing starts and approximately 80% of our current combined revenues. We will leverage the power of both companies' operating systems to extend our competitive advantage of the market.  We expect our scale will yield continued productivity opportunities this year in addition to our deal synergies. We are still in the early innings of this important work in both legacy companies and we have meaningful opportunities to drive productivity and efficiency across the combined company. For those who don't know me, I am relentless when it comes to ensuring the safety of our team members. We have put many processes in place to protect our associates during the pandemic. And I'm also encouraged by the 12% reduction in recordable injury rates for the pro forma combined company in 2020. But to be clear, our goal is 0 reportable injuries, and we have more work ahead of us to accelerate our progress towards achieving that goal. For my second topic, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk with you about our updated mission, vision, values and strategy. A core team of leaders from both legacy companies work together to finalize the mission, vision, values and strategic pillars that will serve as our guidepost as we continue to grow our share of customers in the specialty building materials production and distribution space. On Page 8 of the investor deck, you can see that our mission is to be the best supplier of building materials and services by having a people-first culture that delivers exceptional customer service and innovative solutions to help build more efficiently while at the same time, creating superior value for our stakeholders. Also shown on Page 8 is our vision, which is to make the dream of homeownership more achievable for everyone, making Builders FirstSource the most valuable partner in the industry. And we rely on our values to guide our behaviors in achieving our mission and vision: safety, people, integrity, customers and excellence, or as we like to say internally spice, a blend of ingredients to produce a better outcome. Next, I'm excited to introduce the combined company strategy, which consists of 4 key pillars. The first is to expand our market penetration by leveraging and growing our portfolio of value-added products and services. Second, drive operational excellence to improve our profitability, invest in innovation and provide outstanding service to our customers. Our third strategic priority is to cultivate, build and empower a high performing culture. And the fourth, we will continue to pursue a disciplined approach to strategic acquisitions with many opportunities in our pipeline and one of the strongest balance sheets in our industry. The investor deck has a slide that highlights the details of our strategy on Page 9. Importantly, you should recognize that this strategic framework is similar to one shared by both legacy companies over the past several years, which just underscores my confidence that executing it well will result in strong and sustainable future comp and bottom line growth. We will leverage our significant free cash flow generation to drive growth while preserving a strong balance sheet, enhance our double-digit return on invested capital and return capital to shareholders. We have brought together 2 very strong companies with complementary capabilities and cultures. As we look ahead, I have no doubt that together, we will be able to accelerate profitable growth through our customer-centric service model. Finally, I'd like to briefly share with you how our important work on integration is proceeding. Back in September, we officially launched our integration management office, or IMO, a cross-functional team comprised of strong leaders from both organizations who are responsible for leading our integration efforts. In addition, executive sponsors were assigned to lead the 9 functional work streams responsible for developing detailed initiatives to integrate, optimize and transform the combined company once the merger was finalized. Back in October, we launched an organizational survey for both companies to better understand any culture related issues that might affect our success as a combined company. Encouragingly, the survey showed that the cultures of the 2 companies are remarkably similar. This, along with the fact that most of our associates have been through the integration process before, has given us a high level of confidence that our integration plan will be implemented successfully and on schedule. On day 1 post close, the teams came together to discuss growth opportunities and the many ways our combined company will create value from the merger.  As I said before and firmly believe at the heart of this merger is growth, expanding our geographic reach in a highly fragmented industry, enhancing and growing our suite of value-added offerings and our market position, pursuing strategic acquisitions and giving our people the resources needed to deliver results and grow their careers. Since we closed the transaction early last month, we have been seamlessly executing our plan. The integration is on track, and I feel even better today about our prospects for the future than I did in August when we announced the transaction. Over the next 3 years, I have complete confidence in our ability to deliver $130 million to $150 million of run rate cost synergies and we are on track to realize $60 million to $70 million of those cost synergies in our 2021 results. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I would like to highlight one of our many valued team members. [Beto Valdovinos], a trust production manager at our Colorado Springs location. [Beto] joined the company out of high school. And 19 years later, he is a top operator and a respected mentor. Thanks to his leadership, [Beto's] location earned one of the highest efficiency ratings of any trust plant at our company last year. [Beto] truly grew up in the trust world. His colleagues praise his success through his hard work, dedication and incredible attitude. He is also a leader in safety, taking great pains to ensure facilities are clean and that everyone is well versed in proper protocol. In large part, due to his guidance, the Colorado Springs location has been accident-free for nearly 10 months. Thank you, [Beto], and the many incredible associates who have made the first several weeks of our integration so smooth while continuing to maintain the superior quality of service that our customers expect from us.  It's an exciting time at Builders FirstSource as we execute our strategy and remain focused on serving our customers, growing our share, capturing synergies associated with our merger and driving shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to highlight our financial performance and our outlook for the year. Great question, Mike. This is Dave. We're excited about the balance sheet, as you point out. And as you heard Peter say, we have a lot of opportunities to invest capital inside the company to support our growth. I love a lot of things about the culture of the 2 companies. The millwork business that we have combined, the trust and offsite component manufacturing. Both companies were investing heavily in those. We will continue to do that, including automation of our facilities. You'd heard me talk at BMC about that over time. Chad and Peter had also talked about that. So a very good alignment around that. And as you think about just from a legacy BMC standpoint, the 150 locations, which are now 550, I get excited about that. I get excited about things like READY-FRAME penetration. And the opportunity to take that across the country and 3 times the number of facilities that we have. So a lot of exciting internal investment opportunities. To your point around M&A, we've got one of the strongest balance sheet here inside the industry. And that wasn't by accident, as you know, from both legacy companies' perspective. And you heard me say in my comments, as excited as I am about our platform and our growth potential, we still have a relatively small share. And this, this industry remains highly fragmented. As Peter said, we've got a strong M&A pipeline. And we're 57 days into the integration. So we've got a lot of work ahead of us here. But you will see us continue to be an aggregator in this industry over time because there's a lot of opportunities to do so, and we're well positioned for that. Yes. Another great question, Mike. I'll put it to Peter here in a minute, but let me just say, as you've watched both legacy companies execute in what was a high inflationary environment and in '18 and then that deflation in '19 and just unprecedented inflation and supply constraints in 2020. We're -- we've got a lot of expertise around that. And I have the utmost confidence that whatever the market brings our way in terms of the inflation and deflation that we're going to do a great job of managing through that. And I think because of those challenges in the market over the past couple of years, I think we've sharpened our toolkit, and we've got even better at doing that, which is what you see represented in the way we've executed on a margin basis here over the last couple of years. Peter? Great question, Matt. And I'll just say to Peter's comments earlier during the prepared remarks, there's been an increasing challenge here to go from start to completion based on what's been going on in the supply chain. As you look at lumber, we just talked about lumber, OSB is as tight as it's ever been, even getting windows and doors, and we've all talked about a lot of those challenges in the past. And the result of that has been just extension of the time from start to completion of the home.  Now having said that, we're projecting starts in the mid upper single-digits. We are going to capture absolutely as much of the core organic growth that can possibly be had here. We're well positioned for it. Our customers have large backlogs, which underscores the confidence that Peter outlined in terms of our performance throughout 2021 and even into 2022, given the reality of where we are in the market. And many of these product categories not improving from a capacity standpoint anytime soon. So we've got a lot of confidence in our performance. As you've seen, you heard Peter talk about double-digit core organic growth here to start 2021. And we're going to outperform the market regardless of what's going on. A great question. I'm excited about it. As you watch both legacy companies performed here over the last couple of years, you saw continued penetration in leading the market down the value-added path. And I think in large part, driven by the needs of our customers. They're continuing to look for ways to get more efficient and productive, and that plays perfectly into our value-added offerings. And I think that was only exasperated here in the past 6 to 9 months based on the strength of the market, some of the supply chain challenges. So these builders need to get more effective of what they do, and we're pleased to have the offerings that we do. So we expect continued strong organic growth and penetration of the markets and especially in markets that haven't historically been a component market. We think the time is right now, labor constraints are still very real, and I think we'll continue to fight those sort of challenges. And to your question around what to expect going forward, I think we've talked about our first priority here going forward is to invest in the strong growth opportunities that we have inside the company. And I'm not any more excited about any of that than on our value-added offerings, including READY-FRAME. And so that's what I think you can expect going forward, which is a lot more of the same and the wherewithal to continue to accelerate that growth. Yes, great question. And I can talk about READY-FRAME for a long time because in legacy BMC we were continuing to invest in it, and we're excited about the growth, which, as we've talked about over the past couple of years have been from a house penetration standpoint in the double-digit growth arena. I would just tell you, in legacy BMC in the fourth quarter, that house penetration was nearly 20% as we continue to grow strength and momentum. And really exciting part about READY-FRAME and that investment to your question is it's a relatively minor investment. We're talking about saws and some computer aided design and capability. But it's a relatively minor investment to extend that across the markets. And it is in large part driven by the know-how of our people, right, to not only design the homes and put that in a READY-FRAME model, but also how we deliver it to job sites and unload it in a way that's very effective for the framer, so they can do their work most efficiently. So a minor investment as we expanded to new markets, and we will continue to be aggressive at doing that. Do we think it's going to last through 2021? Is that your question? Oh, good luck. I apologize. Yes, thank you so much. Yes. Thanks, Keith. And as I mentioned, we've got -- -- Trey, sorry about that. We've got 9 work streams on our transaction here focused on integration. And one of those is growth, as you might expect. And we talked about READY-FRAME, that we're seeing a lot of opportunities. And as we talked about when we announced the deal, one of the exciting parts about the deal is the fact that we will have a broader offering. And even in the local markets where we're individually very strong, one of the other legacy companies might have been stronger in millwork versus components. And as we brought this thing together, we're very excited about half in that full breadth of offering across the footprint. So we're seeing a lot of opportunities like that in terms of growth potential across our value-added segments with several others. But it's early days. The team is working hard on it, and we're very excited about it. Yes, we do. There's certainly been enough increases across the board from different vendors that I think to think otherwise would be misinformed. There are a lot of reasons for it. Some of it is inputs. Some of it is cost of doing business. The other is, I think, just the recognition that we're chasing a nice strong number and capacity in the market is struggling to keep up, so people are trying to balance that price capacity, that price volume metric. But it's certainly something that we -- I won't say we're happy about, it's part of what we do. We perform well in markets with strong pricing. So we are participating in that. We're making sure we stay disciplined about it, communicating with our vendors where we think it's maybe out of line. But for the most part, trying to be supportive to make sure we have an industry that can grow and continue to respond to the demand. Hey, Trey, good and important question. Let me start, and then I'll flip it over to Peter. But I think for a number of reasons, I think the lumber questions here are starting to become less and less important, especially in our combined company. First of all, as we've talked about, we're both expert in managing through this cycle. And as you heard us say earlier, we're real confident in our ability to do that regardless of what the market throws at us. And a lot of the things that we talked about that we're excited about here being -- having the largest footprint in our industry. Here a broadest portfolio of products. The geographical reach with 550 locations, 85 of the top 100 MSAs and importantly, as you look at our millwork and components business, that's more than $5 billion of the combined company revenues right now, and they're the fastest-growing in the company. So linked back to our strategy, growing those value-added components will be an important part of how we grow the company and how we continue to improve profitability, not that lumber won't be an important part of what we do, and it always will be. But it's going to have less and less of an impact than what we do over time, right? And so I just want to get everybody's head calibrated. That's one of the most exciting parts about this merger. And I would just say, we've got to stop thinking about what we're building here as a lumber distributor, right? We are a growth company and a fast-growing one at that. And I think time will prove that out as we go forward and drive this growth in areas that are non-commodity related. But Peter, go ahead. Yes, we can tag the team. I mean as you point out, that Reuben, I mean the average square foot of the home has continued to fall. And I think that's accelerated over the past couple of years just based on the entry-level or first time step up buyers. I think we're somewhere around 2,300 square feet at this point for the average home size. But as you've heard me say in legacy BMC, I don't really get concerned about the size of the home as long as it continues to fuel growth, right, in the industry. And I haven't met a start. I don't like yet at this point. So as long as that holds up and continues to fuel growth, we're going to continue to penetrate with our value-added offerings. Well, as you rightfully point out, I mean it's early days, right? But as we talk about that growth work stream earlier, we're excited about it. We see nothing as a deterrent in that. We've not had pushback. And in fact, our customers are equally excited about our combined offering in a lot of these markets. And so time will play out. But we're excited, see no roadblocks, and we think the future is very bright to continue to penetrate those markets with our offerings."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I wanted to start by saying our thoughts remain with all those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain diligent in keeping our associates, suppliers, customers and community safe. Safety will continue to guide our operating strategy. Our thoughts are also with our fellow Texans. It has been a challenging time over the past 2 weeks, and we wish everyone a fast recovery. BFS and BMC together had an incredible and transformational year in 2020. We cannot have done it without all our dedicated team members. They are a true testament of excellence to driving growth while still meeting the needs of our customers in an unprecedented environment. I want to congratulate and thank them for everything they accomplished last year. We closed our merger on January 1 and have formed the nation's premier supplier of building materials and services with tremendous opportunity for continued growth. The transaction allows us to expand our footprint and enhance our local relationships in many of the nation's largest and fastest-growing markets. We are well positioned for long-term growth underpinned by a resilient and expanding housing environment as well as a significant capital base for M&A.  We expect to deliver above-market growth through our shared commitment to growing our value-add offerings which allow us to closely partner and integrate with customers to streamline the construction process. In addition, this larger platform strengthens our ability to create and invest in best-in-class innovative solutions that deliver significant benefits to our customers. Our increased scale, combined with substantial synergies will help drive EPS accretion and robust cash generation, providing even greater resources to invest in innovation, technology and operational excellence. We expect this housing environment to fuel profitable growth and value creation for all stakeholders for the years to come. Over the past several months, Dave and I have traveled in many regions of the country to meet with team members while adhering to our safety protocols. We also held a socially distance town hall in our Dallas office and shared the video with all our team members. The feedback has been very positive. We are seeing firsthand that our former stand-alone organizations share a passion for partnering together to serve our customers, and now we share an excitement about our future opportunities as the new Builders FirstSource. Dave and Peter will discuss the merger, integration and specifics of the quarter and full year performance shortly. However, I would like to highlight the fact that legacy Builders FirstSource achieved top and bottom line results for the full year 2020. Net sales were $8.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $700 million, up 18% and 36% from the prior year, respectively. Before I turn the call over to Dave, I would like to thank everyone who supported me during my more than 20 years at Builders FirstSource. When I joined BFS in 1999, it was, of course, much smaller, having only made a few acquisitions at that time. I couldn't have dreamed that this company would be where it is today, an industry leader, but more importantly, such a special place to work, filled with incredible people and where I have developed lifelong friendships. To all our shareholders and analysts, thank you for supporting our team. I've enjoyed the time with you and hearing your perspectives. Builders FirstSource is in a very strong position, and it's the right time to pass it on. I have total confidence in Dave, Peter and the entire senior management team to leave this company into the next phase of growth and drive even stronger relationships with our valued customers. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Thank you. We appreciate everyone joining the call today and for the continued support of our company. I'm personally looking forward to watching what this new management team and all of our incredible team members will accomplish in the years ahead. As you heard throughout the call today, there is a lot of excitement around the future of our company. I certainly share that excitement and truly believe BFS is in the strongest position it has ever been. I am proud to have been a part of this amazing journey over the past 2 decades. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Peter or Mike. Thank you. Stay safe, and adios."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking our team for the incredible results and focused execution during this unprecedented time. I will cover 3 topics with you today. First, I'll review BFS' stand-alone fourth quarter results, then I'll discuss free cash flow, provide you with an update on our upsized revolving credit facility and discuss our pro forma leverage. And finally, I'll give you the roadmap for how we see the market and our outlook for 2021. Standalone Builders FirstSource had $2.5 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter, a 43.5% increase compared to a year ago. Core organic sales increased by 15%, while commodity price inflation added 26.5% to net sales. Our latest acquisitions completed during the year contributed to a net sales growth of 2%. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 10.8%, led by 16.9% growth in our manufactured products category and 5.3% growth in our windows, doors and millwork category. We continued to experience accelerated and stronger-than-expected demand across the country throughout the fourth quarter.  As a reminder, the fourth quarter is typically a slower part of the homebuilding season. Our gross profit of $669.2 million was an increase of 40% year-over-year. Gross margin of 26.4%, while slightly better than expected, decreased 60 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an inflation driven shift in product mix towards our lower-margin commodity products. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 480 basis points to 18% amidst cost leverage on commodity price inflation, higher core organic sales and continued strong expense control, which more than offset higher variable costs related to the increase in net sales. Adjusted EBITDA grew $147.8 million to a quarterly record of $257.1 million, an increase of 135%. The increase was primarily driven by organic sales growth across all 3 of our customer end markets and commodity inflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 10.2% of net sales compared to 6.2% in the same period a year ago. I'm extremely proud of our team for delivering these very strong results. Our continued focus on and efforts to improve our mix and carefully managed pricing levels supported our record gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income for the fourth quarter. Let's turn to our cash flow. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $260 million, while investing over $260 million in working capital. We also invested $104 million in capital expenditures, including 2 new greenfield trust manufacturing facilities among several growth initiatives. As well as refreshing vehicles and equipment and investing in technology and automation to support operational excellence and increased sales volume. On a pro forma basis, the combined company's operating cash flow was $468 million, less CapEx of $181 million. Last month, we amended and extended the maturity of our existing $900 million revolving credit facility. The amendment increased total commitments by $500 million, up to $1.4 billion in total, while extending the maturity by an additional 26 months. The increase and extension of this facility provides us with an improved capital base that better represents our larger reach and scale going forward. Earlier this month, we gave notice that on March 3, 2021, $82.5 million of the 2027 notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. At the end of the fourth quarter, our pro forma net debt was approximately 1.3x our LTM adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we have no long-term debt maturities due until 2027. Our strong stand-alone and combined results in 2020 demonstrate positive momentum for the new Builders FirstSource and the broader homebuilding industry where demand continues to outstrip supply. Turning to our outlook. We continue to see robust underlying demand in the single family and remodeling sectors. Most builders are seeing increased buyer traffic and new home orders. Our business momentum continued in January, reflecting another month of double-digit sales and organic growth as compared to prior year period on a pro forma basis. Although housing starts were strong in the fourth quarter of 2020, homebuilders continue to experience an extended construction cycle. This shifts the timing of a new start to our sales, as evidenced by houses under construction growth of approximately 17%. We expect this dynamic to continue throughout 2021 until homebuilders work through their elevated backlogs as we see these backlogs providing a strong foundation for our business and the industry throughout 2021 and into 2022. We, therefore, expect net sales for the full year 2021 to be in the range of $13.9 to $14.6 billion or an approximate 9% to 14% increase from our 2020 pro forma net sales of $12.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow 20% to 25% over our 2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA.  As Dave mentioned, we expect to realize $60 million to $70 million of the cost synergies this year. The dimensional lumber index averaged 676 -- $676 per thousand in the fourth quarter and hit 2 quarterly all-time highs during 2020. We have seen commodity costs to remain at elevated levels in January and February, and futures have even reached new all-time highs. Despite elevated levels in 2021, we do anticipate commodity prices to normalize in the back half of the year. As in the past, we remain highly confident that we will successfully manage through the inflationary and deflationary environments and will exceed the guidance if commodity prices stay at elevated levels. Our outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release, including growth in single family starts across our geographies in the high single digits. While demand for single family starts remains extremely high, we believe actual starts will be constrained by material and labor availability. Multifamily starts declined in the low single-digits and R&R growth in the low single-digits. Our free cash flow is projected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million this year. Our significant cash generation and low leverage gives us the ability to invest in growth initiatives and deploy value-creating capital.  Our capital allocation plan includes reinvesting in the business in both growth and maintenance capital expenditures. We also have a solid pipeline of M&A candidates. As you heard from Dave, we believe the long-term underlying industry fundamentals remain very healthy, as evidenced by strong homebuyer demand and continued adoption of value-added products. The factors under our control further support our ability to drive results in this environment. These include continued expense management, delivering deal driven cost synergies and ongoing operational excellence initiatives. With our strong flexible balance sheet position, we have a significant opportunity ahead of us to continue to be a consolidator within our $120 billion addressable market. Overall, the new Builders FirstSource entered 2021 on exceptionally strong footing, and we are excited to deliver another year of record results. So with that, operator, let's open the call to questions. And exactly right, the work that we've been talking about over the past few years on pricing management and training within the organization. I think it was true in BMC, just like it was for BFS. It really has come into play as you've seen such dramatic increases in the price of commodities, right? Our ability to react has gotten better. Our disciplines around the management of that has gotten better. And I think you've seen that in the gross margin results. I would also say that there's some truth to the idea that a move that dramatic has forced everyone in the industry to take stock of pricing more aggressively, right? I mean you're -- this isn't something you could ever hope to protect your customer from when you're up 100-plus percent in some products. So certainly a respect for the need to change pricing quickly and we participated in that. And I think we did, as you mentioned, far better than usual as a combination of those 2 factors. As for the long-term estimate, you're right on. We did revert to a long-term average. There's certainly a lot of debate about whether or not there's going to be a new normal. I think that's fair. There are some legitimate questions out there. But at the end of the day, the game of prognosticating commodity prices is not one we really like to participate in. We've proven an ability to make money on the way up. We've proven an ability to make money on the way down. And for us, we think, a modest forecast on normalization in the back half of the year is just a smart and prudent way to communicate the business. And we're just excited about the core, but we think we've got a great platform here and the growth we have for the year looks really fantastic. And like you said, the comps do get more challenging in the back half of the year, but I just want to reiterate, our assumptions around both commodities and single family starts are but our attempt to give you a modest and reasonable, a thoughtful look at what we think the market can do, given the dynamics at play. If the market does better than that, we're going to do better than that. No hesitation in saying that. We're just trying to give you what we think is a thoughtful view. We're certainly very bullish on the overall strength of demand. This is not a demand commentary. We think consumers are strong. Trends are solid. We like what we're seeing, and that's sort of the hint you saw for 2022. The inability to deliver on the products that demand is asking for. Is really just an extension of the build cycle, and we think that bodes very well for us and for the industry. Yes. No, that's a great question. It's been a difficult time, obviously, not just for us, for the whole state. We had some interruption. As you might imagine, we had some shutdowns. The initial read is that it's probably around $40 million in sales that were delayed as a result of those shutdowns. We'll see how it plays out through the rest of the quarter. For a company of our scale, obviously, that's not material, but it's impactful to the folks in the state. So we've done some work with our employees to make sure we're supporting them and those that were impacted, and we're continuing to bring all of our facilities back up and candidly, they're running quite well. Now as you can imagine, there's a lot of pent-up demand. There was any way in a very, very busy market and they're rolling hot right now. It's fun. There is a little bit, yes, attributable to the manufacturing facilities. That's a great question. I don't know we've ever broken that out before. I don't have it handy on me. Yes. I mean we generally talk about it is about 70% variable. So most of that cost moves with the increasing and decreasing volumes. It's a bit less than that when we talk about the commodity influence component of growth, but certainly, the bulk of what we do is moved by the volumes. Yes, yes. And as we finish the purchase accounting, we'll have some updates for you on sort of what the dollars are going to be in those buckets. But as it stands, that's still a work in progress. Yes. So that 12% to 13% is not familiar to me. Maybe that was on the BMC side. The number we've used in the past is closer to 8% to 9%. That's a number that includes the receivables, inventory and payables amounts. Now obviously, that's gone down over time. And we'll move as we look at the valuation of commodities in the current numbers. But just as a rule of thumb, that 8% to 9% as an incremental percentage vis-a\u0300-vis sales is the right way to think about it. Sure. Yes. So the -- generally speaking, we talk about the fall-through on our incremental sales in that 12% to 15% range. Obviously, you'll see certain movements that will go above or below that. But there's a good rule of thumb for how our business grows over time. So that fall through, as you see the expansion, both in the underlying volume and in the commodities throughout the year, this year will fall through, and you'll see that gross margin then translate as we talk about the volume -- impact on SG&A will translate down into that EBITDA number. So to think about it more broadly, we like high prices. As a distributor, this is certainly a very good season for us, if you will, in terms of the prices we're seeing and the growth, the leverage of our business is quite strong, as you can imagine. So that's the reason that's driving that fall-through to those very high numbers. We also do expect to see an increasing generation of synergies throughout the year as well as an increase in generation of productivity savings and improvements throughout the year. I don't know if I would say it's a straight-line increase, but for the purposes of this discussion, that's a reasonable way to look at it. Yes. I think it's far more the latter. The demand is so strong. The problem is our ability to build the homes that people want as an industry. So while there could be on the edges, some headwinds, but framing really isn't anywhere near an important part -- an important part of the cost of the home as many other factors. So sure, there's a component there is inflation in a couple of other areas that in the long term, may drive demand down. But at this stage, I'm not sure we're going to be able to see it and as time passes, I think we'll be able to fix some of the constraints in the industry that will normalize that as well, which I think will then feed back into a stronger demand profile as well. Yes. Well, I mean, like I mentioned, it's still a work in progress, but a pretty substantial step-up on the purchase accounting, as you can imagine, right? That will burn off over a few years. But as it relates to the valuations that we'll do as part of that purchase accounting, we'll see a pretty substantial step up. Yes. You know what, that's a fair question. We do anticipate seeing increasingly difficult comparisons as you get through the year, right? You're looking at the beginning of the year last year, pretty modest numbers across the board. And by the end of the year, looking at record commodities, record starts, a lot of records in there, which have been pretty fun, I could admit. But yes, the comps will get harder in the back half of the year. The real question is what happens with commodities and starts. There's the numbers that we've got laid out here would indicate some tough comps, but if things stay elevated, it will stay good. But overall, the year looks great, a lot of confidence in both the overall industry and our performance. Yes, no, great point. And we're -- we do pretty well at lumber too which is, I think the right way to think about it, right, maybe will be the core of where we're headed, but we do well at it. And the short answer to your question, Trey, is you're right on. It is going to be a really nice tailwind if it stays high, based on the guide that you would get because the math will show, right? You got a first half growth, second half headwind. If you look at just the math of the commodities, I mean, you take away the second half headwind, that's a great story. We'll look forward to enjoy that business, if you're right. Yes. And I think what you might be alluding to is the rumor and the rumblings that people are -- that might turn, right? We're seeing folks that are more committed to the homes that they're sort of stuck in, right. So they like it a little bit bigger, they want that office where they can close the door, for example. So there's, I think, reason to believe that we may see the end of that shrinking of the home. I've seen no data yet, but I think it's reasonable to think that's a real thing. And that will just sort of take away one of the little headwinds we were seeing in the industry and be a stabilizing factor. To Dave's point, though, we could still see an average decline just because I think the growth of the single-family starter home has been so strong, which is great for us, right? It's just a win for everybody. Yes. We've got a really nice position, like you said. Our debt, as the leverage ratio based metric is quite low. We feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and tend to maintain that as a priority. Moving into the investment opportunities, Dave alluded to it, and I think we all feel good about it. As we get to the cash generation point in our year we'll have gotten through a lot of the initial stress of the integration and be in a stronger position to really be aggressive on some of those M&A opportunities that are out there, we really like the portfolio. I think we have a lot of runway in front of us to consolidate the industry. And the short answer, if for whatever reason, all of those things don't use up the cash. Sure, the options are open, right? You've seen both companies buy back shares in the past, and we'll look at it. But right now, we feel like we've got -- the sites are full with great targets. Yes, I don't think the commodity is strong enough to skew sales from second half to first half. I think, I mean, second half is historically stronger, so I think we should continue to see that. I mean the answer on the commodity capacity question, it's a good one. I mean, I'm up 2 minds, right? On one hand, some capacity coming online doesn't appear to be enough to pull the rug out from under it. But the counter to that argument of sort of bullishness on prices is that historically, this is not an industry that's held price. Just isn't. So I don't know that I want to be the guy to put my foot down and say, yes, this time, it's different. I haven't seen any evidence to prove that. So we're going to continue to put that sort of modest sort of reasonable number out there. And if it's better, then it will be good. Yes. I mean, in context, multifamily is about 6% of our business. So it's pretty specifically focused on certain geographies and certain projects. There is a bit of exactly what you described, projects that sort of are concluding, and the pipeline will still good. Looks to be maybe not as much of a positive a contributor as it was last year where the team really sort of did a really nice job of expanding our capacity, that gets a little harder in this environment. I think we've all seen multifamily struggle a bit. We feel good about the business. We think there's still a growth opportunity there, but just sort of line of sight thinking it's going to moderate a bit. Yes. You nailed it, that's a great question. The short answer is our business being distribution based is going to generate a tremendous amount of cash as sales decline, and that includes the value of commodities and any sales decline associated with that. So certainly do expect, given our stated belief or stated forecast, rather, that the commodity prices are going to come down. There is a component in there. It's unfortunately, it's a little bit hard to put your finger on it. But to put it in context, we talked about the increase in working capital usage in 2020. And being about $260 million in our prepared remarks. So just to kind of put it in context that, that's directionally the types of numbers you'd expect to see when extrapolating that to the larger entity for a full switch back to sort of historical. Yes. You -- I think you've been peaking into my ops reviews. So that's a good one there. We've got obviously a lot of facilities around the country right now that are focused on meeting the increased demand. A couple of factors there, obviously, hiring, being an important one, making sure we're running all the ships we can, utilizing equipment fully and in markets where even that's not enough, making sure we're bringing in the increased capacity on the equipment side that we need. So we talked a little bit earlier about the ability and the willingness and the desire to invest in organic growth for the company. That's the sort of tip of the spear, right? It's how do you react to make sure you've got the right trust equipment, door machines, saws, computer equipment to be able to chase that expanding use of value-add while continuing to invest in the trucks and the core operations that we need. But you're absolutely right. We're focused on making sure we're reacting in those markets that are white hot to have the capacity that we need. And it's a high-quality challenge, right, a high quality problem. I don't know if I can point to a specific driver. I think you might be just seeing the impact of multiple variables and low end of the range. Commodity is absolutely growth in various regions and the variables we put around that. So I don't know that I have a hard answer for you. That's right. Yes. We generally tell everyone that the best proxy for our long-term growth is that single-family starts metric, and it's true. The challenges with an extension of that build cycle, you start to get a little bit of wiggle, right, that look is coming and it's a little harder to draw the line. So we just wanted to point that out everybody to say it's still the right number, but it will extend the time that we'll be able to enjoy the upside if that expansion of homes under construction continues out for a while, we think that that's going to happen. So '21 into '22 and then as things -- as we expect, continue to be strong, that gives us a nice runway. So yes, you're right. So one of the things that has been a discussion in both fixed-price contracts and the appropriateness of them in light of the market and the market dynamics. Our observation is those appear to be falling as a percentage of the total, just given the way the market has evolved over the years. There's certainly something that, as you can imagine, we manage very closely to make sure people are living up to their commitments. We live up to ours as a partner in this industry. We've got the financial wherewithal to do what is right, no matter what, but also making sure that both sides are living up to it. So that's something we're careful with. But more broadly, it's about the relationship with the customer and working with them in a way that's obviously good for the end customer and mutually beneficial and watching the evolution of the industry, it appears that, that is something that's declining overall, but still an important material part of our business."

I will now turn the call over to Chad Crow.\nChad Crow: Thank you, Binit. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. As the pandemic continues, I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Our thoughts continue to be with those affected, and I would like to again recognize our dedicated team members for their commitment to excellence during the challenges of the past several quarters. The safety of our team members and of the surrounding communities where we operate, remain our top priority. Safety will continue to guide our operating strategy. Before diving into our results, I will start on Slide three and spend a moment discussing our recently announced merger with BMC Stock Holdings. This merger is on track to create the nation's premier supplier of building materials and services with combined adjusted EBITDA of approximately $950 million, including run rate synergies. Together, we will have an expansive geographic footprint and enhanced local relationships in attractive high-growth markets. The combined company will benefit from greater geographic reach and diversity within what is still a very fragmented industry. We will have a strong footprint in many of the nation's largest and fastest-growing regions and will be exceptionally well positioned for long-term growth, supported by a resilient housing environment. We expect to continue to deliver above-market growth through our shared commitment to value-added product offerings, which allow us to closely partner with customers to streamline the construction process. In addition, a larger platform will strengthen our ability to invest in best-in-class innovative solutions that deliver significant benefits to our customers. During the past 1.5 months, Dave Flitman and I have traveled to many regions of the country, including Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and Mountain states and the West Coast, among others. In many of these cities, we have held town hall meetings to hear directly from our team members about their local market strengths. It was extremely beneficial to observe both of our company's capabilities in real time and envision all the ways we will be able to complement each other to do some truly exceptional things for our customers. It brought both of us great pride to see our hard-working team members across the country whose efforts are directly responsible for putting us in the successful position we are in today. Both Dave and I enjoyed getting to interact with so many team members and seeing their excitement for future opportunities as we take our combined business to new heights. In terms of timing, thus far, the deal is progressing as expected. The merger planning work that is happening in the background right now continues to be very positive. In October, we filed a 30-day extension under the HSR review process with the DoJ. Also in October, we filed our Form S-4 with the SEC. We are working diligently with both agencies. Once we have completed these two regulatory milestones, there will be a required 20 working day notice before Builders FirstSource and BMC request their respective shareholder approvals. This keeps us on track to close the merger in late 2020 or early 2021. At this point, I could not be more pleased with our significant strides towards winning together as one, which is our merger tagline, while continuing to stay focused on customers and delivering exceptional operational performance. Moving to our results on Slide 4, I will outline the key factors underpinning our excitement about what we accomplished during the quarter. First, the momentum we carried into the third quarter continued with performance ultimately being better than we had anticipated. The homebuilding markets have been resilient. Improving housing starts, record low mortgage rates and a shift towards suburban living are all positive fundamentals that continue to support demand for our products and services. Since mid-year, activity in our end markets continued to trend positively, resulting in demand improving throughout the quarter. During the quarter, we experienced a steady recovery in sales as we have seen a broad-based improvement across geographies and end markets. We are back to work in all of our locations around the country and are able to safely and effectively deliver critical products and services to customers, while keeping up with the robust demand in much of the country. Our team delivered strong results all around. For the first 9 months of the year, sales increased by over 9% to a record $6 billion. Approximately 3% of growth was from core organic performance, and our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added more than two percentage points to growth. While housing demand has accelerated rapidly, we have also seen commodity prices reach record heights. Commodity inflation contributed approximately 3% to sales and 1 additional selling day contributed about 1%, which led to the increase in reported net sales of over 9% year-to-date. This brings us to our second theme. Through our focused execution, we have remained appropriately resourced to capture rising demand in a disciplined manner. This has produced record adjusted EBITDA of $443 million for the first 9 months of 2020. The gross margin just shy of 26% year-to-date is a direct result of our ability to react quickly and effectively to rapidly evolving market dynamics since midyear. In addition, our operational excellence initiatives remain core to our strategy. Alongside the momentum in our markets are - and our business right now, this set of best practices is being implemented throughout the organization and making our company more agile and easier to do business with. Key initiatives in process include investments in distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back-office process efficiencies and information system enhancements. We launched these initiatives in 2018 and have made significant progress laying the groundwork for what will no doubt prove to be efficiency enhancing investments as we move into our next generation of growth. And finally, amongst the many [indiscernible] planned merger of BMC to our team members, customers and shareholders, we will continue to expand our network of value-added offsite component manufacturing facilities, which are core to our collective strategy. Post combination, that will continue to be a focus of our combined growth. With a portion of the cash we intend to generate, we will continue investing in value-added growth through both organic and inorganic opportunities. As an example, in October, we commissioned a state-of-the-art greenfield truss plant in Riverside, California, extending our industry-leading position to 66 manufacturing facilities. Whether through new facilities, new truss lines in existing plants, door facility expansions or other system enhancements, these differentiated offerings offer industry-leading value-add capacity and will remain key to enhancing our geographic footprint, technological capabilities and integrated partnerships with customers. The favorable market conditions we see today should provide growing opportunities for the bigger and better Builders FirstSource. We know customers value our commitment to high-quality service and in particular, our ability to continually invest in our service capabilities throughout the housing cycles. This is a differentiator for Builders FirstSource within our industry. It has been an element of our success in 2020 and will continue to be a core focus after we complete our transformational merger with BMC. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our third quarter results in more detail.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. I would like to start by also recognizing our team's focused execution, including the quick reaction to the sharp rise in both demand and lumber costs. I will review our third quarter results, provide an update on the merger and in the guidance on how we see the market going forward. We had $2.3 billion in net sales in the third quarter with core organic sales increasing 6.7%. Core organic excludes acquisitions and commodity impacts from net sales to give an indication of the underlying performance of the business. We experienced accelerating demand across the country as demand continued to be stronger than expected throughout the home buying season. Our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added 2% to net sales. Commodity price inflation added another 7.2%. As a result, net sales in total increased by 15.9%. Our value-added product categories continue to perform well within our respective markets. I will note, however, that the impacts of both commodity inflation and COVID-19 in the hardest hit regions of the country has had a disproportionate impact on our value-added products despite higher underlying demand in most of the country. Gross margin of $570.7 million in the third quarter of 2020 increased by over $29.5 million over the third quarter of 2019. Our gross margin percentage was 24.9%, which was well ahead of our expectations, though down 240 basis points from the third quarter of 2019. The margin percent decrease on a year-over-year basis was attributable to sharp increases in commodity prices. The commodity inflation and lumber cost we have experienced since may continued throughout the quarter. So please keep in mind the mechanics of our margins as we have discussed on prior calls. Over the long term, higher prices benefit our business, however, price fluctuations, especially in commodities, can cause significant swings in our results. Commodity cost inflation causes short-term gross margin percentage headwinds when prices spike relative to our short-term pricing commitments that we provide customers. Additionally, higher prices in commodity products have a negative mix impact on gross margin percentages. As mentioned, I\u2019m pleased with our team's ability to mitigate unfavorable impacts this quarter through a combination of focused execution and disciplined pricing. As we neared the end of the quarter, commodity prices started to ease, albeit at a very high level. Although we expect our gross margin percentage to continue to be pressured in the fourth quarter, we do expect to benefit from higher gross margin dollars generated from the higher commodity prices. Interest expense increased by $300,000 to $28 million compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of onetime items related to debt issuance and extinguishments in the prior year period, interest expense increased by $3.4 million due to a higher outstanding balance as we proactively increased our liquidity and financial flexibility. Third quarter EBITDA increased $24 million from a year ago to $184.3 million, an increase of 15%. This is the highest quarterly EBITDA in our history, driven by the top line growth, combined with the reduction in variable expenses related to commissions as well as lower travel and fuel costs. EBITDA margin held steady at 8% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $96.7 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared to $84 million or $0.72 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase of $12.7 million or $0.10 per share was primarily driven by improved operating results. On Slide 6, the strength of our business was evident again in the third quarter. Our team grew net sales across 4 of five product categories, led by lumber, given the dramatic escalation in costs. Value-added core organic sales showed healthy growth, increasing by approximately 2% despite continuing to be disproportionately impacted by geographies slower to recover from the pandemic, largely in the Northeast. Excluding this region, value-added product sales grew by mid-single digits in the rest of the nation. With the continuing labor challenges faced by our customers, demand for our labor-saving products is expected to continue to rise. To meet this growth, we plan to invest approximately 25% of our total 2020 capital expenditures in our value-added growth initiatives and expanding of our production capacity. Core organic sales grew by an estimated 6% in our single-family customer end market compared to the prior year, helped by accelerating demand in the majority of our regions. Market tailwinds and underlying economic conditions continue to be very supportive of demand. Builders are ramping up activity in response to that demand as evidenced by double-digit year-on-year increases in single-family starts. We expect these starts to provide a long runway for growth as they translate into increasing units under construction and ultimately, completions. Organic growth in the R&R and other end market grew by 7% as we continue to see relative strength in the Western part of the country. Multifamily core organic increased by 18%, largely due to the timing of large projects. Turning to our outlook on Slide 8. Our results in the first 9 months demonstrate a positive homebuilding environment that is supporting rising demand across our footprint, which continued into October. Year-to-date results reflect our team's focused execution and ability to stay on top of the extremely dynamic commodities market from both a price and cost management perspective. Our success is in large part attributable to our team's experience in managing through all types of market environments and the trust customers place in us to be their partner of choice. During 2020, the housing market has proven to be resilient with annualized single-family housing starts rising 17% in the third quarter and up 6% year-to-date. A number of tailwinds point to further strength in the fourth quarter and beyond. The builder confidence index reached an all-time high of E5 in October. We estimate significant pent-up demand from increased household creation and significant underbuilding of single-family homes over the past decade. Mortgage applications continue to decline with mortgage rates also near all-time lows, and existing home inventories also near all-time lows of three-month supply. We are seeing the benefit of residential construction catalysts in nearly all localities where we operate, outside of the Northeast. With this backdrop, we are introducing our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. We anticipate fourth quarter core organic sales to be in the mid- to high single-digit percent range year-over-year. While we are undoubtedly optimistic, we continue to manage our business with a prudent growth assumption, which accounts for the lag before housing starts translate into units under construction and ultimately, completions. In recent months, factors such as tight labor and material scarcity has extended builder construction cycles. To put that in perspective, over time, completions will approximate roughly 100% of starts, but at the moment, completions represent only approximately 80% of the current level of housing starts. Keep in mind, our core organic growth outlook reflects our core sales performance and excludes the sales contribution from acquisitions as well as the significant commodity inflation that we expect in the coming quarter. We estimate our fourth quarter gross margin percentages to be consistent with Q3 at around 25%. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect our cash interest will be in the $110 million to $115 million range. With our growth projects underway again, we reiterate our expectation for capital expenditures to be in the $100 million to $110 million range for the full year. Since 2018, we have generated nearly $1 billion of operating cash flow, and we fully expect to build upon that cash generation through year-end 2020. I will now turn the call back to Chad for his closing remarks.\nChad Crow: Thank you, Peter. This is an exciting time for Builders First Source. We are on path to close out a record year with 2020 adjusted EBITDA expected to be approximately $640 million or 25% above last year at the midpoint of our guidance. This outperformance to prior year comes as we reap the benefits of the structural enhancements we have made as we implement operational excellence initiatives, deepen our presence in high-performing value-added businesses and empower our sales teams to compete wisely in the commodity product market. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the Builders FirstSource team and thank each member for their dedication to our company, customers and communities. Looking ahead, we are all very pleased to welcome the BMC team to the Builders FirstSource family. Our accomplishments to this point have only strengthened my conviction in the merits of this merger. This merger will allow us to deliver solutions that make our customers more productive and efficient through deeper and more integrated relationships than ever before. Value-added offerings will continue to represent the largest portion of our business and the focus of our investments. With our expanded capital resources, we believe we will be uniquely positioned to accelerate our profitable growth through underlying market expansion, supplemented by targeted acquisitions and operational excellence initiatives. This merger aligns with our shared growth strategies and occurs at an optimal time for both companies to create significant value to a much larger and more efficient platform. We look forward to completing this merger and working closely together with a unified leadership team that has a proven record of successful integrations. I\u2019m confident that with the two outstanding organizations coming together, we will be better positioned than ever to be the supplier of choice for building materials and value-added products and services in the years to come. With that, thank you again for joining us today, and we will now open the call up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Congrats on the results. So I wanted to start out maybe pressing on the value-add product performance a little bit. The organic is still a little lighter than the rest of the business. And it sounded like you are attributing disproportionate impacts from the Northeast, and I think you said, Peter, mid-single-digit growth elsewhere, if I heard you right. But I think last quarter, there was some underperformance, which you talked about, related more to the West than to Florida. So I guess if you could just kind of unpack sort of what is going on there and maybe how value-add is expected to perform within that Q4 revenue outlook?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yes. So there are a couple of layers to this. This has been a pretty dynamic year. So as we talked about, the beginnings of COVID's impact on our business, the parts of the country where we were hardest hit, the Northwest, the Northeast and Florida, were those areas, for the most part, that were seeing government shutdowns. So everything was shut down or significant parts of the business were shut down. So a lot of exposure to value add in those businesses. So we saw the greater-than-normal or greater-than-average negative impacts on value-add. As we got into this summer and through the back half of the year, the geography impact still true from the perspective that I would say the Northeast has been the slowest to recover. The Northwest bounced back pretty quickly after the COVID reopening hit. The entire Northeast corridor has been much more, I would say, gradual in the recovery back to normal, I would say, still below normal in those markets. And again, that exposure in commodities and - is different - I'm sorry, the exposure to value add is different in those markets than it is in the rest of the country. Another way to look at it is, if you think about those parts of the country that have grown the most and have the best performance, if you think about the South, Texas is a great example, in many ways, electing not to participate in the downturns related to COVID, that is a market that doesn't have as much exposure to that value-added product. There are some other factors at play. We talked a little bit about the extended build times. We think that the homebuilder cycle, despite the rapid increase in starts, is extending. We have heard that comment from a few folks, whether it be due to product availability or labor availability. We think that has also shown a bit of an impact, particularly on products that we see towards the back half of the build cycle that is included in value add for us. All in all, we are not concerned about it. We continue to monitor it. I think it is important, obviously, to our strategic vision of the company. But all of our data says we have reason to be confident. We are positive about our backlogs. We think that the overall environment is very, very positive, and we see it picking up again. But certainly, there have been some speed bumps. We all know how hard it is to run a manufacturing operation in general. And during the age of the COVID, that is certainly a challenge for us. So we will continue to keep an eye on it and manage it, but certainly optimistic about what we see coming. Backlogs look good. Demand looks good. I haven't seen people moving away from manufactured product. So we think it is just some unevenness in the business.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Makes sense. I appreciate the thoughts there, Peter. And secondly, I wanted to ask just on the merger. It sounds like the time line is on track, but you have continued to obviously progress with the merger planning. So I guess I'm just curious if there is any sort of operational updates around how you are thinking about that, some of the things we talked about like overlapping locations in a few markets, maybe any finer points on the synergy potential. Just as you have continued to dig deeper, just curious what kind of the latest is on the operations.\nChad Crow: Yes. I would kind of sum it up as expected. Clearly, we are still two separate companies, and so we are doing as much of the planning as we can in the interim. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, Dave and I visited a lot of locations. There is a lot of excitement out there amongst our team members on the opportunities that we are going to have as a go-forward company. But no real surprises good or bad so far. It is just as expected, which is good. Still feel good about the synergy ranges we have given. One thing that is clear, we are all very busy. So there is not a whole lot of excess capacity sitting around at the moment, which is a high-class problem to have. So yes, it is going as expected, which is a good thing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Dahl: Tremendous results, guys. Good way to end the year. First question, just around margins, and this is more thinking towards 2021. So as you noted, lumber has started to move lower and given your lag, would you think about 2021 as being back in that normal 26% to 26.5% range at this point? And I guess, similarly, any thoughts on - there is always moving pieces around SG&A, but you guys have done a great job keeping costs under control and leveraging the top line. So any thoughts on kind of where we should be thinking on normal SG&A?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. That is a great question. And you have heard me make this half joking comment before, if you can tell me what commodities are going to be, I will tell you what my margins are going to be. It is a really big question, Mark. That run up that we saw this year in commodities is unprecedented. And while it is turned, it is certainly not back to historical norms. We are quite elevated, and I think the market in some ways is still digesting it. It is certainly still passing through in our pricing. We have [indiscernible] some of the materials that the homebuilders have put out there about what they are doing with their pricing. Some people have maybe tried to play the game a little bit from what we are reading into their comments that they have tried to slow down or speed up their build cycles. Personally, I think they are missing out in terms of the opportunity and the demand that is out there. We are motivated to build whatever we can and get it out. And I think that dynamic, as it evolves over the next 6 months, will be impactful on us, no doubt. But the core of the business is where all of our effort is going in terms of being ready to deliver on that demand. The likelihood that we are going to see a return to those really high lumber prices is low. So I think it is fair to say that we will see some tailwinds associated with the deflation for a bit of time. But it is so volatile and so dynamic in different in different parts of the country. I would say at this point, I'm not comfortable putting a normal out there for you. What you are saying doesn't sound unreasonable, but I couldn't point you to a real number at this stage just until things normalize and sort of settle out a little bit. The other big factor is putting our two businesses together and seeing what our - what the combined entity starts to perform at, that will be a critical piece to that as well.\nChad Crow: Yes. I would just add nothing has structurally changed with our business, obviously, but it is a very volatile time. And as Peter mentioned, lumber prices has dropped significantly in the past month, but they are still well above any sort of historical averages. The framing lumber composite, the print right now is still 50% higher than a five-year average, and you go all the way up to OSB, which is still over 100% higher. So still a very healthy environment for us. As you know, we love high lumber prices. So if they do stay elevated into next year, that is a wonderful environment for us. Could margins be a tick lower? Maybe, but we will still be reaping the benefit of higher-margin dollars, which we know at the end of the day is the name of the game. So feel good about the business. And the short answer is there is nothing structurally that is changed in our business in the past few quarters that would cause, in my opinion, our margins to vary from what they have historically in a more normal commodity environment.\nMichael Dahl: Right. Okay. I appreciate that, Chad and Peter. I guess, I will ask a slightly different way, and this has been more of a hypothetical. But let's say obviously, going into next year, there is still going to be some carryover tailwinds from inflation based on what we are still saying. In an environment where we gradually normalize down to, call it, a 450 to 500 lumber, which would still be above normal and OSB kind of normalizes lower. Based on what you are seeing in demand, you guys have the $750 million target out for 2022, but you are exiting 2020 at a really strong rate. Is it possible that you hit the $750 million, actually a year early in 2021?\nChad Crow: I guarantee you, we will. We will have BMC's results under us so...\nMichael Dahl: I mean on a core basis.\nPeter Jackson: There is, I mean, a couple of factors here, right? I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the day we close, that $750 million is sort of in the rearview mirror, and we will be working on putting a new number out there for everybody. The reality of the impact of commodity prices on that is undeniable, right? Of course, we are going to be able to deliver sooner if we got that tailwind. But again, our goal is really to focus on the core of the business, which is strong and is growing, and we are going to continue to refine and commodities are going to be what they are going to be. I think if we spend all of our time talking about commodity prices and its impact on the bottom line, we will have lost the real value in this business. But yes, I do think that could get us there sooner if they stay on it.\nMichael Dahl: Sure. And certainly, didn't mean to focus too much on commodities. Part of the point there was just the underlying strength of the business giving you a path there as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: Congrats on the great results. So first off, of course, I guess, sticking with lumber, one more question there. It is been pretty tight up until now. And of course, there is been some extended lead times out there. First, did that impact you at all in the quarter? Have you seen that improve at all? And then kind of second to that is how you are thinking about inventory positioning as we enter kind of the slower - seasonally slower winter months where maybe some supply might loosen up?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So I will try and answer those in order. We certainly did see certain markets, certain products, particularly certain species and lengths, get very, very tight during parts of the year. We, like everybody else, struggled at certain times to get everything that we wanted. I think we feel pretty good about getting what we needed. I think the numbers support that. We have seen, as the fall has started to set in, that some of that product has absolutely become available. And I think that is what you are seeing in the reflection of the prices in the spot for the random lengths coming back down. I would say it is not back to normal yet. But I would say that we are still running our business based on what we believe to be the right disciplines, meaning we are going to limit our inventory, we are going to keep our inventory tied to our days demand, we are going to bring it down seasonally. And then plan to bring it back up as we need to coming into next year. But right now you have seen a pretty good - this may come up later in the conversation, you have seen a pretty big increase in the value of our working capital. I will point to the fact that is basically all driven by the value of the product rather than the quantity of product we have on hand. We intend to stay lean.\nChad Crow: Yes. Trey, I will just add, there is definitely been some - not just in products, we deliver just across the board. As you know, there is been some product shortages and those continue. I have heard instances in the Dallas market where bricks are out 12 weeks, and I know people personally building homes that are waiting on doors and windows. And if you look at the data the last couple of months, this may be the first time it is ever happened and definitely in recent years where new home sales have outpaced starts, it is usually the other way around. So the backlog is very strong, but I do think, as Peter mentioned in the opening comments, the cycle times are going to be extended because of tightness of product and labor. And it is a high-class problem to have, right? And it will extend this backlog and this favorable environment into next year, which isn't a bad thing. But I do think it is important as you think about our business and the industry in general that we will likely see cycle types extended in the coming quarters.\nTrey Grooms: Sure. Makes sense. And then kind of on that, with product shortages you are calling out here, outside of lumber, there have been some pretty sizable price increases announced by some of the manufacturers across most of your product lines. You mentioned doors, but also gypsum wallboard and some of the others. So with that in mind, what kind of inflation outside of lumber are you expecting? As we go into next year, do you think it will be higher than normal given the demand and some of the product shortages out there? Or just any color on other types of inflation outside of lumber.\nPeter Jackson: You are right. There have been some price increases announced. You will have to forgive me if I wait to believe the gypsum guys. The impact is certainly inflationary right now. The nature of the demand, the interruptions to the supply, the additional costs required for manufacturers to have to address the whole COVID environment. I certainly think there is an inflationary environment. The reality, though, is what we have seen in the past in many of these business lines is that the cure for high prices is high prices, and they generally will slow themselves down or they will begin to add capacity in order to normalize it. I don't think it will get carried away. But at the end of the day, as a distributor, we will pass along those price increases, and we think that makes our business healthier as we better leverage the flow-through.\nTrey Grooms: Great. One last one for me is on the 25% of CapEx that you are kind of earmarking this year for expansion of the value-added capacity this year. How much should that add to your capacity going forward? I mean, how much does that $25 million or so, whatever the exact number shakes out to, what does that translate into as far as capacity? And is that 25 kind of a good bogey going forward? I know with the combined company, there is still maybe some questions. But is that a pretty decent bogey for that going forward even with the combined company with the outlook that we have for housing?\nPeter Jackson: You know what, that is a great question. I think that the mix of what we are investing in at any given time, I mean we talked about Riverside and the new truss facility, those are pretty significant investments, sort of onetime. The nature of the capacity expansion related to individual machine lines and expansion of existing facilities is generally a little bit different. So it is kind of hard to give you a hard number, but it certainly has been supportive of the expansion in value add that we have talked about. That 25% in terms of a future investment, that is an interesting question because on one hand, I would say, yes, I think that is reasonable based on what we have seen over the past couple of years. But I will also admit that the demand does seem to be increasing in that value-add space, and we may decide to accelerate our investments in that area just because it is got such a great return. And in certain markets, particularly as we combine these two businesses, I think it is going to really unleash our capabilities to sell a broad swath of the market on value add, and I could see that increasing over time. A little early yet, to be honest, but I certainly I wouldn't be shy about putting more money into that, given our investment performance, our returns to date.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist Securities.\nKeith Hughes: I had some questions on the guidance for fourth quarter, some eye-popping growth there. And given some of the variables, I'm struggling to get to the number. Is there a substantial change coming in SG&A from third to fourth? Or is there anything else you can tell me on how you are getting the number?\nPeter Jackson: Well, the fourth quarter results for SG&A are always a little dynamic as we true-up all of our year-end reserves and sort of do our final cleanup. So there is always a bit of that. Yes, I mean, I think the big story is not a surprise to anybody, it is the impact of commodities and what that does. As you look at our business, 30% to 40% of our products are exposed to that commodity fluctuation. And with those currently being up basically double where they were last year, you have got a pretty significant impact to the business. And that, of course, is going to reflect in the nature of your SG&A fall through, your percentages. There is an impact, right, the nature of what we have seen in the commission rates going up and down. The leverage has certainly benefited, but you also have the required reserves in the business and the increased commission dollars associated with those sales. So a little bit of flexing rather in those numbers, but nothing material has changed or there some area of concern.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. The price, 7-ish percent in the quarter, I assume it is going to be substantially higher commodity price in the fourth quarter is playing a role, is that correct?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, yes.\nKeith Hughes: Yes. Okay.\nPeter Jackson: Double underline the yes.\nKeith Hughes: Double underline the yes, there you go. Second question, looking at it a little bit longer term. You have highlighted in several answers the backlog, and we are seeing that all throughout my coverage. Do you think this is going to be a continued, as you said, high-class problem to deal with all through next year? Is that how long it is going to take to clear this up? Or is that something we could - early spring, the lead times could come down?\nChad Crow: No. I would say it should certainly carry us to midyear. You get beyond that, it gets a little fuzzy. A lot can happen, election year, et cetera. But I would say all in all, it is shaping up to be a - should be pretty good demand for 2021 first half. I wouldn't say it is in the bank, but it is looking really good. But it is just really hard to predict this business when you get beyond 6 or 8 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsey: On value add, maybe some questions on - are the supply chain disruptions in the industry, are they pushing more builders to use value-add products? And as you try to expand your value-add product business, are there any supply issues in getting the equipment that would maybe slow down your investment plans to grow that business and maybe slowing CapEx maybe - than you would like to grow faster?\nPeter Jackson: Well, I think the opportunity for expanding value add and increasing demand in value add is usually around the labor side, right? I mean, in most cases, the supply of the product has not been the big issue. It certainly does limit their ability to sort of do it themselves when they can't get access. We have very good relationships with our vendors. We partner very closely with both the sell-through product vendors, but also the machine vendors. And being the size that we are, I think they see us as a good customer. And so we work with them to make sure our orders for the equipment that we need are in early and that we have a pipeline that we are ordering each year. So less concerned about our access. Although let's face it, all manufacturing has been pretty disrupted. So that is something that we are going to continue to stay well ahead of in order to make sure we don't have issues in that regard. But value add, it is been a problem this year. Windows and doors, in particular, have struggled. And not to throw stones at them, it is been a very difficult time. But that is certainly an area where we are hoping for a good, solid recovery because we believe in the demand story.\nSteven Ramsey: Great. And a follow-up on that. In the areas of the country that are doing well, high demand, high start activity, but you don't have as much value-add exposure in those areas, do you plan in the next 6 to 12 months to greenfield or open more - or expand value-add capacity in those areas? Or does the acquisition of BMC gets you into those areas to maybe a degree that you would like?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. It is a mix. Some markets, it absolutely helps us, and we are excited about what we are going to be able to do together and we will be able to add capacity. I mean the reality is if capacity in the market is constrained, it is because all of us are already constrained. So that will be a different challenge. Those markets where we don't play as much, there may be opportunities to do some of that. There is a lot to say grace over right now.\nSteven Ramsey: Great. And then last quick one. Multifamily activity and timing helped Q3. Is it a benefit in Q4 and early 2021?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So multifamily, we think, will settle down a little bit. We certainly were benefited by some projects that came through. The multifamily team has done a really nice job for us. We think it will slow down a bit, but continue to be a good area for us. And we are not anticipating - I know that there have been some market forecasts out there that are pretty depressing. We don't think it will be that bad for us. But it is certainly an area of the market - as you get closer to commercial, those larger scale projects have been more impacted by COVID and the dynamics of the marketplace than some of the smaller areas where we tend to focus for multifamily. So we are feeling pretty good about it. A pretty small part of our business overall, but we think it will be a tailwind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Reuben Gardner with The Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner: I wanted to harp on the commodity question, but I do have a clarification. I don't know if concern is the right word, but questions around how much of your EBITDA strength in the back half of this year was driven by lumber. Normally, you guys have a profit pressure during these rising price environments. Has the increase been so dramatic that even though you have got that gross profit margin drag, the net of higher commodity prices has been a positive for you on a year-over-year basis in a substantial way? And if so, could you quantify how much net benefit to EBITDA is in your fourth quarter and third quarter results?\nPeter Jackson: So two halves to your question. I would say the first part to your question is around kind of the performance of the business in terms of pricing. We certainly did better than we had done in the past. I think there are a couple of main reasons for that. The first of which I have tremendous gratitude and admiration for our team in terms of being able to execute, utilizing some of the tools we have been working on, utilizing all the experience that our teams have been very, very proactive, very aggressive in terms of responding to the marketplace. Getting those prices changed quickly, managing the costs and the inbound ordering, doing it in a very disciplined and quick reacting way, I think, was the biggest impact. I will also say that we certainly benefited from the headline nature of those commodity price increases. There wasn't anyone who didn't know. There wasn't anyone who could say, well, I'm not going to buy from you because it is expensive. And I was like, okay, well, you are not buying it from anybody else either because we have got a good position. We can get you the product that you want. If you would like it, this is what it costs. So I think that those combination of factors certainly was a huge benefit and the reason why we performed as well as we did. We generally don't try and break out for you the exact impact of commodities from an EBITDA perspective. We have talked about how much we felt was impacting for the third quarter in that 7.2% range. We think the fourth quarter, just to be explicit, we will be in the - 25% to 35% of our growth will be attributed to commodity inflation in the fourth quarter. Just as a general rule of thumb, we have talked about our fall through in that 12% to 15% range being roughly true for the impact of commodities up or down as well. So if you want to use some rough numbers, that is a good way to think about it, although I will tell you the exact math is a bit more painful.\nChad Crow: Yes. Just to clarify, the 25% to 35% is Q4 over Q4 sales growth we expect to come from commodity inflation. It is a big number.\nReuben Garner: Got it. yes. Okay. Yes, that was very helpful. And then shifting gears away from commodities, I'm sure you are tired of hearing about it, I am, too. Next year, something that is been a drag for the whole industry over the last several years has been the size of homes shrinking. I think it is been kind of a low single-digit volume drag for everybody, and I think you guys have seen that as well. Are you seeing or hearing an opportunity for things to go the other way? How big of an opportunity from a volume benefit for your products do you think you could get out of out of some of the bigger - the return of the bigger luxury houses in some of the suburban markets?\nChad Crow: Well, a couple of things. Yes, I do think homes have gotten smaller. It feels like maybe that is starting to bottom out now. But I don't worry about that a whole lot. I have said many times over the years, the only way you get back to a normal building environment of 1 million, 1.1 million single-family houses is you have got to have that mix of smaller homes. And that is what we have been missing really since this recovery started. And so to us, it is a good thing. It gets you to that higher flow through. It gets you to that throughput on the homes coming through the system. And yes, there is a higher mix of smaller ones. But again, the only way you get to those historical average is to have that proper balance, and we have just been missing that.\nPeter Jackson: I have read the articles that people are now nesting and wanting a bigger home after being trapped. And I think we will have to see. I think there is maybe hope that things level out. I'm not sure it turns into a tailwind because of what Chad was talking about. We need those smaller homes, and we will get them. I think that expansion of that starter and move-up home part of the industry is great news, long overdue.\nReuben Garner: Got it. Congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank.\nSeldon Clarke: So you saw 7% organic sales growth in the third quarter and call it, 9% to 10% growth, including M&A. But total SG&A was only up about 3%, and it looks like it is going to be down in the fourth quarter just based on your guidance. I know you talked about some true-up there stating that it is not the best way to think about it. But moving forward, if you can continue to generate the sort of mid- to high single-digit organic growth rate, ignoring commodities for a second, how should we think about the relationship in that scenario between SG&A and volume growth?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So we have historically talked about SG&A being about 70% variable, about 30% fixed. Now the unique dynamic that you alluded to is this idea, that is based on real volume and not the sort of vagarities of commodities, if you will. So that is the only adjustment I would advise you to make sure you are keeping track of. But yes, we certainly have seen great leverage as a result of the expansion of commodities as well as great leverage off of the core, the core organic growth.\nChad Crow: And I think you commented that SG&A was going to be down in the fourth quarter, and I don't think that is correct. I think when you layer in the sales growth, the top line growth, including the inflation, you will see that it is probably not.\nSeldon Clarke: Okay. That is helpful. Yes, I think I was understanding the commodity impact. And then kind of a just higher-level question, but Chad, you talked about going into some of your more local markets and hosting these town halls. And you mentioned just briefly that you were excited about some of the capabilities and complementary aspects of the merger. So could you just give us a little bit more color on maybe what you learned throughout this process? And whether you are thinking about the potential top line synergies any differently now that you are kind of a couple more months into the process and you have had these experiences meeting with some of the local teams and things like that?\nChad Crow: Sure. Yes. What was really good to see is as you go into some of these and we were visiting primarily the markets where we overlap and mainly major markets. But really good to see the geographic footprint. So just top of mind there, you can see the potential in logistics savings, where our footprint might be more focused on the South end of town and their footprint might be more focused on the North end. It certainly is going to give us some ways to optimize our delivery. From a product selection standpoint, we would see a facility where they are very big. They have a very big ready-frame operation, for example, and we are very big in components. And they may also have a large millwork facility. And so when you look at in these major markets where we overlap, just the completeness of the product and service offering we can offer our customers and then how much better we will be positioned from a geographic standpoint to deliver it, that is what you are after, right. You want to be able to serve your customers with the full breadth of offerings, but also in the most efficient way you can. And so we saw a lot of examples of that. And then not to mention just the enthusiasm. And in many cases, there was almost a little mini family reunions going on when we saw some people that we have traded employees over the years. And they have got a lot of talented people, we have got talented people. And it is really great to think about really we will be the A team when we put these two companies together.\nSeldon Clarke: Got it. And in that example, where you have got a facility in the North end and they have one in the South that have slightly different product categories, historically, has that changed the market share or pricing dynamics in those sort of specific areas?\nChad Crow: Well, if you are a builder, clearly, you typically are going to have - want to have more than one supplier, right, just to make sure you are keeping everyone honest. But the advantage there is by offering that full breadth of products - so builders - we want to position the company where we can make the builders' life as easy as possible and make it easier to do business with us than any of our competitors. And so the more we can offer that as I said, that broad expansion of products and services, the more likely they are going to want to do business with us. Will that tend to lead to additional share of wallet? Yes, it should. Price? Maybe. There is still going to be other competitors in the market. They are still going to keep you honest. But it is more about being that go-to supplier for the builder and making their life as easy as possible and easy to do business with us versus any of our competitors. That is what you are after, and that is why these two businesses will complement each other so much and help us achieve that in a lot of these overlap markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.\nRyan Gilbert: Just to ask the 2021 EBITDA commodity price impact, maybe a different way. Looking back to the last period of rapid commodity price inflation and then subsequent deflation in 2018, 2019, I thought what was interesting about 2019 is that even though you experienced a commodity price headwind on revenue, you were still able to grow adjusted EBITDA throughout the year. So looking at third quarter and fourth quarter gross margins, even less impact from commodity prices than what you experienced in 2018. Just wondering what your confidence level is that you can continue to grow adjusted EBITDA if you know this commodity price tailwind turns into a headwind in the quarters coming.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I mean it is a great question. I think that each cycle is a bit different. The extreme nature of this one has certainly impacted the industry differently. We are going to be in a different demand profile, I would say, going into next year. So that could potentially change things as well. I think we have got to wait and see how it plays out. I do feel really good about the underlying core though, right. Our ability to manage pricing, our ability to get good leverage off of the business, our ability to continue to grow the underlying operations in the strong demand environment and the movement toward value add, I think are all very positive tailwinds or data points for that discussion. But we just have to wait and see.\nRyan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. And then second question on structural components. I mean we have heard from you and from many homebuilders that cycle times are extending. It seems like builders should be looking for opportunities to improve their cycle times or their productivity, and it seems like, at least in theory, structural component should offer that. So I'm wondering if your builder customers are more - or if you are getting more inbounds from homebuilders about using structural components to kind of speed up the framing process or if homebuilders are more receptive to your sales teams who are selling structural components.\nChad Crow: Yes. As we said all along, shortages in labor create the perfect environment to drive builders who aren't currently using components to consider them, and that is certainly in an environment we are still in. And combine that with just the overall demand, the existing customers that are using components and just the incremental number of homes, they are wanting us to run through our component plants. As Peter said earlier, the backlogs are very strong right now. So it should be a very value-add-conducive environment for the next few quarters.\nRyan Gilbert: And do you think that the recent surge in demand and extension of cycle line has had some noticeable impact in builder demand for structural components?\nChad Crow: Yes. I wouldn't say it is off the charts. As you can imagine, we have got customers that have traditionally used components, and they are keeping us very busy right now with the increase in starts that we have seen in recent months. But yes, certainly, there is been an uptick in incoming inquiries and demand. And as I said, I don't see the labor issue getting better anytime soon, especially with the strong surge in starts. So as I said, I think that is going to continue to be a pretty favorable environment for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.\nKurt Yinger: I just want to start off. I mean, with two pretty remarkable periods of volatility in commodities over the last three years, is there anything internally or that your customers are pushing to do to maybe change some of the backward-looking price locks? And I realize it is not completely standardized, but is there anything creative or something that people are trying to do to maybe smooth it out a bit?\nPeter Jackson: Well, there is certainly been a lot of conversation about it, no question. I think there are some ebbs and flows and some customers have gone away from the price locks or tried to. I think some of us in the industry in the distribution space have looked for ways to create a bit more stability in terms of the way we buy, whether it be directly from the mills or contractual relationships. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the options markets are really all that helpful just based on the way that they work right now. So there have even been discussions about how that might change in the future. I'm optimistic that in our new structure as the combined entity with BMC, that might be something we could even continue to follow down that path. Our ability to be a positive influence and a stabilizing influence in this industry, I think, is enhanced with our scale and with our ability to act in a coordinated way. So we will absolutely continue to look at that. And certainly, some interesting models based on some folks have done out there.\nKurt Yinger: Okay. Okay. That is interesting. And just my second one. An earlier question touched on the $750 million EBITDA target. Could you just remind us within your own control as far as the operational excellent targets, kind of where you stand as far as putting those in place and the biggest buckets of opportunity that remain?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yes. I mean we had talked about a roughly $65 million target out there for ourselves. I think we are probably about halfway based on what we talked through up until prior year. Continuing to make progress in that space. We certainly see the best opportunities, the biggest opportunities for ourselves in a couple of key areas. I think that, that pricing management and pricing discipline, sort of taking the inconsistencies and inefficiencies out of our process is still being a potential forward-looking benefit for our business. Excited to see what we can do partnered together with BMC in that way as well. And then I think our ability to continue to enhance our internal operations using digital tools, processes, whether that be as we interact with our customers, but even back office. We certainly still see tremendous value going forward, leveraging best practices, leveraging technology and then a combination of those two things, we think will be really impactful. So certainly feel very good about our ability to deliver and go beyond those targets we would issued back in 2018. So certainly expecting that to be an important part of the way the business is going to run post merger as well.\nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to now turn the conference back to Mr. Chad Crow for any closing remarks.\nChad Crow: Thank you once again for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our future results and the progress on our merger with BMC. If you have any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to reach out to Binit or peter. Have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chad Crow",
            "content": "Thank you, Binit. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. As the pandemic continues, I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Our thoughts continue to be with those affected, and I would like to again recognize our dedicated team members for their commitment to excellence during the challenges of the past several quarters. The safety of our team members and of the surrounding communities where we operate, remain our top priority. Safety will continue to guide our operating strategy. Before diving into our results, I will start on Slide three and spend a moment discussing our recently announced merger with BMC Stock Holdings. This merger is on track to create the nation's premier supplier of building materials and services with combined adjusted EBITDA of approximately $950 million, including run rate synergies. Together, we will have an expansive geographic footprint and enhanced local relationships in attractive high-growth markets. The combined company will benefit from greater geographic reach and diversity within what is still a very fragmented industry. We will have a strong footprint in many of the nation's largest and fastest-growing regions and will be exceptionally well positioned for long-term growth, supported by a resilient housing environment. We expect to continue to deliver above-market growth through our shared commitment to value-added product offerings, which allow us to closely partner with customers to streamline the construction process. In addition, a larger platform will strengthen our ability to invest in best-in-class innovative solutions that deliver significant benefits to our customers. During the past 1.5 months, Dave Flitman and I have traveled to many regions of the country, including Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and Mountain states and the West Coast, among others. In many of these cities, we have held town hall meetings to hear directly from our team members about their local market strengths. It was extremely beneficial to observe both of our company's capabilities in real time and envision all the ways we will be able to complement each other to do some truly exceptional things for our customers. It brought both of us great pride to see our hard-working team members across the country whose efforts are directly responsible for putting us in the successful position we are in today. Both Dave and I enjoyed getting to interact with so many team members and seeing their excitement for future opportunities as we take our combined business to new heights. In terms of timing, thus far, the deal is progressing as expected. The merger planning work that is happening in the background right now continues to be very positive. In October, we filed a 30-day extension under the HSR review process with the DoJ. Also in October, we filed our Form S-4 with the SEC. We are working diligently with both agencies. Once we have completed these two regulatory milestones, there will be a required 20 working day notice before Builders FirstSource and BMC request their respective shareholder approvals. This keeps us on track to close the merger in late 2020 or early 2021. At this point, I could not be more pleased with our significant strides towards winning together as one, which is our merger tagline, while continuing to stay focused on customers and delivering exceptional operational performance. Moving to our results on Slide 4, I will outline the key factors underpinning our excitement about what we accomplished during the quarter. First, the momentum we carried into the third quarter continued with performance ultimately being better than we had anticipated. The homebuilding markets have been resilient. Improving housing starts, record low mortgage rates and a shift towards suburban living are all positive fundamentals that continue to support demand for our products and services. Since mid-year, activity in our end markets continued to trend positively, resulting in demand improving throughout the quarter. During the quarter, we experienced a steady recovery in sales as we have seen a broad-based improvement across geographies and end markets. We are back to work in all of our locations around the country and are able to safely and effectively deliver critical products and services to customers, while keeping up with the robust demand in much of the country. Our team delivered strong results all around. For the first 9 months of the year, sales increased by over 9% to a record $6 billion. Approximately 3% of growth was from core organic performance, and our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added more than two percentage points to growth. While housing demand has accelerated rapidly, we have also seen commodity prices reach record heights. Commodity inflation contributed approximately 3% to sales and 1 additional selling day contributed about 1%, which led to the increase in reported net sales of over 9% year-to-date. This brings us to our second theme. Through our focused execution, we have remained appropriately resourced to capture rising demand in a disciplined manner. This has produced record adjusted EBITDA of $443 million for the first 9 months of 2020. The gross margin just shy of 26% year-to-date is a direct result of our ability to react quickly and effectively to rapidly evolving market dynamics since midyear. In addition, our operational excellence initiatives remain core to our strategy. Alongside the momentum in our markets are - and our business right now, this set of best practices is being implemented throughout the organization and making our company more agile and easier to do business with. Key initiatives in process include investments in distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back-office process efficiencies and information system enhancements. We launched these initiatives in 2018 and have made significant progress laying the groundwork for what will no doubt prove to be efficiency enhancing investments as we move into our next generation of growth. And finally, amongst the many [indiscernible] planned merger of BMC to our team members, customers and shareholders, we will continue to expand our network of value-added offsite component manufacturing facilities, which are core to our collective strategy. Post combination, that will continue to be a focus of our combined growth. With a portion of the cash we intend to generate, we will continue investing in value-added growth through both organic and inorganic opportunities. As an example, in October, we commissioned a state-of-the-art greenfield truss plant in Riverside, California, extending our industry-leading position to 66 manufacturing facilities. Whether through new facilities, new truss lines in existing plants, door facility expansions or other system enhancements, these differentiated offerings offer industry-leading value-add capacity and will remain key to enhancing our geographic footprint, technological capabilities and integrated partnerships with customers. The favorable market conditions we see today should provide growing opportunities for the bigger and better Builders FirstSource. We know customers value our commitment to high-quality service and in particular, our ability to continually invest in our service capabilities throughout the housing cycles. This is a differentiator for Builders FirstSource within our industry. It has been an element of our success in 2020 and will continue to be a core focus after we complete our transformational merger with BMC. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our third quarter results in more detail. Thank you, Peter. This is an exciting time for Builders First Source. We are on path to close out a record year with 2020 adjusted EBITDA expected to be approximately $640 million or 25% above last year at the midpoint of our guidance. This outperformance to prior year comes as we reap the benefits of the structural enhancements we have made as we implement operational excellence initiatives, deepen our presence in high-performing value-added businesses and empower our sales teams to compete wisely in the commodity product market. I'm incredibly proud of the Builders FirstSource team and thank each member for their dedication to our company, customers and communities. Looking ahead, we are all very pleased to welcome the BMC team to the Builders FirstSource family. Our accomplishments to this point have only strengthened my conviction in the merits of this merger. This merger will allow us to deliver solutions that make our customers more productive and efficient through deeper and more integrated relationships than ever before. Value-added offerings will continue to represent the largest portion of our business and the focus of our investments. With our expanded capital resources, we believe we will be uniquely positioned to accelerate our profitable growth through underlying market expansion, supplemented by targeted acquisitions and operational excellence initiatives. This merger aligns with our shared growth strategies and occurs at an optimal time for both companies to create significant value to a much larger and more efficient platform. We look forward to completing this merger and working closely together with a unified leadership team that has a proven record of successful integrations. I'm confident that with the two outstanding organizations coming together, we will be better positioned than ever to be the supplier of choice for building materials and value-added products and services in the years to come. With that, thank you again for joining us today, and we will now open the call up for your questions. Yes. I would kind of sum it up as expected. Clearly, we are still two separate companies, and so we are doing as much of the planning as we can in the interim. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, Dave and I visited a lot of locations. There is a lot of excitement out there amongst our team members on the opportunities that we are going to have as a go-forward company. But no real surprises good or bad so far. It is just as expected, which is good. Still feel good about the synergy ranges we have given. One thing that is clear, we are all very busy. So there is not a whole lot of excess capacity sitting around at the moment, which is a high-class problem to have. So yes, it is going as expected, which is a good thing. Yes. I would just add nothing has structurally changed with our business, obviously, but it is a very volatile time. And as Peter mentioned, lumber prices has dropped significantly in the past month, but they are still well above any sort of historical averages. The framing lumber composite, the print right now is still 50% higher than a five-year average, and you go all the way up to OSB, which is still over 100% higher. So still a very healthy environment for us. As you know, we love high lumber prices. So if they do stay elevated into next year, that is a wonderful environment for us. Could margins be a tick lower? Maybe, but we will still be reaping the benefit of higher-margin dollars, which we know at the end of the day is the name of the game. So feel good about the business. And the short answer is there is nothing structurally that is changed in our business in the past few quarters that would cause, in my opinion, our margins to vary from what they have historically in a more normal commodity environment. I guarantee you, we will. We will have BMC's results under us so... Yes. Trey, I will just add, there is definitely been some - not just in products, we deliver just across the board. As you know, there is been some product shortages and those continue. I have heard instances in the Dallas market where bricks are out 12 weeks, and I know people personally building homes that are waiting on doors and windows. And if you look at the data the last couple of months, this may be the first time it is ever happened and definitely in recent years where new home sales have outpaced starts, it is usually the other way around. So the backlog is very strong, but I do think, as Peter mentioned in the opening comments, the cycle times are going to be extended because of tightness of product and labor. And it is a high-class problem to have, right? And it will extend this backlog and this favorable environment into next year, which isn't a bad thing. But I do think it is important as you think about our business and the industry in general that we will likely see cycle types extended in the coming quarters. No. I would say it should certainly carry us to midyear. You get beyond that, it gets a little fuzzy. A lot can happen, election year, et cetera. But I would say all in all, it is shaping up to be a - should be pretty good demand for 2021 first half. I wouldn't say it is in the bank, but it is looking really good. But it is just really hard to predict this business when you get beyond 6 or 8 months. Yes. Just to clarify, the 25% to 35% is Q4 over Q4 sales growth we expect to come from commodity inflation. It is a big number. Well, a couple of things. Yes, I do think homes have gotten smaller. It feels like maybe that is starting to bottom out now. But I don't worry about that a whole lot. I have said many times over the years, the only way you get back to a normal building environment of 1 million, 1.1 million single-family houses is you have got to have that mix of smaller homes. And that is what we have been missing really since this recovery started. And so to us, it is a good thing. It gets you to that higher flow through. It gets you to that throughput on the homes coming through the system. And yes, there is a higher mix of smaller ones. But again, the only way you get to those historical average is to have that proper balance, and we have just been missing that. And I think you commented that SG&A was going to be down in the fourth quarter, and I don't think that is correct. I think when you layer in the sales growth, the top line growth, including the inflation, you will see that it is probably not. Sure. Yes. What was really good to see is as you go into some of these and we were visiting primarily the markets where we overlap and mainly major markets. But really good to see the geographic footprint. So just top of mind there, you can see the potential in logistics savings, where our footprint might be more focused on the South end of town and their footprint might be more focused on the North end. It certainly is going to give us some ways to optimize our delivery. From a product selection standpoint, we would see a facility where they are very big. They have a very big ready-frame operation, for example, and we are very big in components. And they may also have a large millwork facility. And so when you look at in these major markets where we overlap, just the completeness of the product and service offering we can offer our customers and then how much better we will be positioned from a geographic standpoint to deliver it, that is what you are after, right. You want to be able to serve your customers with the full breadth of offerings, but also in the most efficient way you can. And so we saw a lot of examples of that. And then not to mention just the enthusiasm. And in many cases, there was almost a little mini family reunions going on when we saw some people that we have traded employees over the years. And they have got a lot of talented people, we have got talented people. And it is really great to think about really we will be the A team when we put these two companies together. Well, if you are a builder, clearly, you typically are going to have - want to have more than one supplier, right, just to make sure you are keeping everyone honest. But the advantage there is by offering that full breadth of products - so builders - we want to position the company where we can make the builders' life as easy as possible and make it easier to do business with us than any of our competitors. And so the more we can offer that as I said, that broad expansion of products and services, the more likely they are going to want to do business with us. Will that tend to lead to additional share of wallet? Yes, it should. Price? Maybe. There is still going to be other competitors in the market. They are still going to keep you honest. But it is more about being that go-to supplier for the builder and making their life as easy as possible and easy to do business with us versus any of our competitors. That is what you are after, and that is why these two businesses will complement each other so much and help us achieve that in a lot of these overlap markets. Yes. As we said all along, shortages in labor create the perfect environment to drive builders who aren't currently using components to consider them, and that is certainly in an environment we are still in. And combine that with just the overall demand, the existing customers that are using components and just the incremental number of homes, they are wanting us to run through our component plants. As Peter said earlier, the backlogs are very strong right now. So it should be a very value-add-conducive environment for the next few quarters. Yes. I wouldn't say it is off the charts. As you can imagine, we have got customers that have traditionally used components, and they are keeping us very busy right now with the increase in starts that we have seen in recent months. But yes, certainly, there is been an uptick in incoming inquiries and demand. And as I said, I don't see the labor issue getting better anytime soon, especially with the strong surge in starts. So as I said, I think that is going to continue to be a pretty favorable environment for us. Thank you once again for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our future results and the progress on our merger with BMC. If you have any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to reach out to Binit or peter. Have a good day. Thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. I would like to start by also recognizing our team's focused execution, including the quick reaction to the sharp rise in both demand and lumber costs. I will review our third quarter results, provide an update on the merger and in the guidance on how we see the market going forward. We had $2.3 billion in net sales in the third quarter with core organic sales increasing 6.7%. Core organic excludes acquisitions and commodity impacts from net sales to give an indication of the underlying performance of the business. We experienced accelerating demand across the country as demand continued to be stronger than expected throughout the home buying season. Our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added 2% to net sales. Commodity price inflation added another 7.2%. As a result, net sales in total increased by 15.9%. Our value-added product categories continue to perform well within our respective markets. I will note, however, that the impacts of both commodity inflation and COVID-19 in the hardest hit regions of the country has had a disproportionate impact on our value-added products despite higher underlying demand in most of the country. Gross margin of $570.7 million in the third quarter of 2020 increased by over $29.5 million over the third quarter of 2019. Our gross margin percentage was 24.9%, which was well ahead of our expectations, though down 240 basis points from the third quarter of 2019. The margin percent decrease on a year-over-year basis was attributable to sharp increases in commodity prices. The commodity inflation and lumber cost we have experienced since may continued throughout the quarter. So please keep in mind the mechanics of our margins as we have discussed on prior calls. Over the long term, higher prices benefit our business, however, price fluctuations, especially in commodities, can cause significant swings in our results. Commodity cost inflation causes short-term gross margin percentage headwinds when prices spike relative to our short-term pricing commitments that we provide customers. Additionally, higher prices in commodity products have a negative mix impact on gross margin percentages. As mentioned, I'm pleased with our team's ability to mitigate unfavorable impacts this quarter through a combination of focused execution and disciplined pricing. As we neared the end of the quarter, commodity prices started to ease, albeit at a very high level. Although we expect our gross margin percentage to continue to be pressured in the fourth quarter, we do expect to benefit from higher gross margin dollars generated from the higher commodity prices. Interest expense increased by $300,000 to $28 million compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of onetime items related to debt issuance and extinguishments in the prior year period, interest expense increased by $3.4 million due to a higher outstanding balance as we proactively increased our liquidity and financial flexibility. Third quarter EBITDA increased $24 million from a year ago to $184.3 million, an increase of 15%. This is the highest quarterly EBITDA in our history, driven by the top line growth, combined with the reduction in variable expenses related to commissions as well as lower travel and fuel costs. EBITDA margin held steady at 8% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $96.7 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared to $84 million or $0.72 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase of $12.7 million or $0.10 per share was primarily driven by improved operating results. On Slide 6, the strength of our business was evident again in the third quarter. Our team grew net sales across 4 of five product categories, led by lumber, given the dramatic escalation in costs. Value-added core organic sales showed healthy growth, increasing by approximately 2% despite continuing to be disproportionately impacted by geographies slower to recover from the pandemic, largely in the Northeast. Excluding this region, value-added product sales grew by mid-single digits in the rest of the nation. With the continuing labor challenges faced by our customers, demand for our labor-saving products is expected to continue to rise. To meet this growth, we plan to invest approximately 25% of our total 2020 capital expenditures in our value-added growth initiatives and expanding of our production capacity. Core organic sales grew by an estimated 6% in our single-family customer end market compared to the prior year, helped by accelerating demand in the majority of our regions. Market tailwinds and underlying economic conditions continue to be very supportive of demand. Builders are ramping up activity in response to that demand as evidenced by double-digit year-on-year increases in single-family starts. We expect these starts to provide a long runway for growth as they translate into increasing units under construction and ultimately, completions. Organic growth in the R&R and other end market grew by 7% as we continue to see relative strength in the Western part of the country. Multifamily core organic increased by 18%, largely due to the timing of large projects. Turning to our outlook on Slide 8. Our results in the first 9 months demonstrate a positive homebuilding environment that is supporting rising demand across our footprint, which continued into October. Year-to-date results reflect our team's focused execution and ability to stay on top of the extremely dynamic commodities market from both a price and cost management perspective. Our success is in large part attributable to our team's experience in managing through all types of market environments and the trust customers place in us to be their partner of choice. During 2020, the housing market has proven to be resilient with annualized single-family housing starts rising 17% in the third quarter and up 6% year-to-date. A number of tailwinds point to further strength in the fourth quarter and beyond. The builder confidence index reached an all-time high of E5 in October. We estimate significant pent-up demand from increased household creation and significant underbuilding of single-family homes over the past decade. Mortgage applications continue to decline with mortgage rates also near all-time lows, and existing home inventories also near all-time lows of three-month supply. We are seeing the benefit of residential construction catalysts in nearly all localities where we operate, outside of the Northeast. With this backdrop, we are introducing our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. We anticipate fourth quarter core organic sales to be in the mid- to high single-digit percent range year-over-year. While we are undoubtedly optimistic, we continue to manage our business with a prudent growth assumption, which accounts for the lag before housing starts translate into units under construction and ultimately, completions. In recent months, factors such as tight labor and material scarcity has extended builder construction cycles. To put that in perspective, over time, completions will approximate roughly 100% of starts, but at the moment, completions represent only approximately 80% of the current level of housing starts. Keep in mind, our core organic growth outlook reflects our core sales performance and excludes the sales contribution from acquisitions as well as the significant commodity inflation that we expect in the coming quarter. We estimate our fourth quarter gross margin percentages to be consistent with Q3 at around 25%. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect our cash interest will be in the $110 million to $115 million range. With our growth projects underway again, we reiterate our expectation for capital expenditures to be in the $100 million to $110 million range for the full year. Since 2018, we have generated nearly $1 billion of operating cash flow, and we fully expect to build upon that cash generation through year-end 2020. I will now turn the call back to Chad for his closing remarks. Sure. Yes. So there are a couple of layers to this. This has been a pretty dynamic year. So as we talked about, the beginnings of COVID's impact on our business, the parts of the country where we were hardest hit, the Northwest, the Northeast and Florida, were those areas, for the most part, that were seeing government shutdowns. So everything was shut down or significant parts of the business were shut down. So a lot of exposure to value add in those businesses. So we saw the greater-than-normal or greater-than-average negative impacts on value-add. As we got into this summer and through the back half of the year, the geography impact still true from the perspective that I would say the Northeast has been the slowest to recover. The Northwest bounced back pretty quickly after the COVID reopening hit. The entire Northeast corridor has been much more, I would say, gradual in the recovery back to normal, I would say, still below normal in those markets. And again, that exposure in commodities and - is different - I'm sorry, the exposure to value add is different in those markets than it is in the rest of the country. Another way to look at it is, if you think about those parts of the country that have grown the most and have the best performance, if you think about the South, Texas is a great example, in many ways, electing not to participate in the downturns related to COVID, that is a market that doesn't have as much exposure to that value-added product. There are some other factors at play. We talked a little bit about the extended build times. We think that the homebuilder cycle, despite the rapid increase in starts, is extending. We have heard that comment from a few folks, whether it be due to product availability or labor availability. We think that has also shown a bit of an impact, particularly on products that we see towards the back half of the build cycle that is included in value add for us. All in all, we are not concerned about it. We continue to monitor it. I think it is important, obviously, to our strategic vision of the company. But all of our data says we have reason to be confident. We are positive about our backlogs. We think that the overall environment is very, very positive, and we see it picking up again. But certainly, there have been some speed bumps. We all know how hard it is to run a manufacturing operation in general. And during the age of the COVID, that is certainly a challenge for us. So we will continue to keep an eye on it and manage it, but certainly optimistic about what we see coming. Backlogs look good. Demand looks good. I haven't seen people moving away from manufactured product. So we think it is just some unevenness in the business. Yes. That is a great question. And you have heard me make this half joking comment before, if you can tell me what commodities are going to be, I will tell you what my margins are going to be. It is a really big question, Mark. That run up that we saw this year in commodities is unprecedented. And while it is turned, it is certainly not back to historical norms. We are quite elevated, and I think the market in some ways is still digesting it. It is certainly still passing through in our pricing. We have [indiscernible] some of the materials that the homebuilders have put out there about what they are doing with their pricing. Some people have maybe tried to play the game a little bit from what we are reading into their comments that they have tried to slow down or speed up their build cycles. Personally, I think they are missing out in terms of the opportunity and the demand that is out there. We are motivated to build whatever we can and get it out. And I think that dynamic, as it evolves over the next 6 months, will be impactful on us, no doubt. But the core of the business is where all of our effort is going in terms of being ready to deliver on that demand. The likelihood that we are going to see a return to those really high lumber prices is low. So I think it is fair to say that we will see some tailwinds associated with the deflation for a bit of time. But it is so volatile and so dynamic in different in different parts of the country. I would say at this point, I'm not comfortable putting a normal out there for you. What you are saying doesn't sound unreasonable, but I couldn't point you to a real number at this stage just until things normalize and sort of settle out a little bit. The other big factor is putting our two businesses together and seeing what our - what the combined entity starts to perform at, that will be a critical piece to that as well. There is, I mean, a couple of factors here, right? I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the day we close, that $750 million is sort of in the rearview mirror, and we will be working on putting a new number out there for everybody. The reality of the impact of commodity prices on that is undeniable, right? Of course, we are going to be able to deliver sooner if we got that tailwind. But again, our goal is really to focus on the core of the business, which is strong and is growing, and we are going to continue to refine and commodities are going to be what they are going to be. I think if we spend all of our time talking about commodity prices and its impact on the bottom line, we will have lost the real value in this business. But yes, I do think that could get us there sooner if they stay on it. Yes. So I will try and answer those in order. We certainly did see certain markets, certain products, particularly certain species and lengths, get very, very tight during parts of the year. We, like everybody else, struggled at certain times to get everything that we wanted. I think we feel pretty good about getting what we needed. I think the numbers support that. We have seen, as the fall has started to set in, that some of that product has absolutely become available. And I think that is what you are seeing in the reflection of the prices in the spot for the random lengths coming back down. I would say it is not back to normal yet. But I would say that we are still running our business based on what we believe to be the right disciplines, meaning we are going to limit our inventory, we are going to keep our inventory tied to our days demand, we are going to bring it down seasonally. And then plan to bring it back up as we need to coming into next year. But right now you have seen a pretty good - this may come up later in the conversation, you have seen a pretty big increase in the value of our working capital. I will point to the fact that is basically all driven by the value of the product rather than the quantity of product we have on hand. We intend to stay lean. You are right. There have been some price increases announced. You will have to forgive me if I wait to believe the gypsum guys. The impact is certainly inflationary right now. The nature of the demand, the interruptions to the supply, the additional costs required for manufacturers to have to address the whole COVID environment. I certainly think there is an inflationary environment. The reality, though, is what we have seen in the past in many of these business lines is that the cure for high prices is high prices, and they generally will slow themselves down or they will begin to add capacity in order to normalize it. I don't think it will get carried away. But at the end of the day, as a distributor, we will pass along those price increases, and we think that makes our business healthier as we better leverage the flow-through. You know what, that is a great question. I think that the mix of what we are investing in at any given time, I mean we talked about Riverside and the new truss facility, those are pretty significant investments, sort of onetime. The nature of the capacity expansion related to individual machine lines and expansion of existing facilities is generally a little bit different. So it is kind of hard to give you a hard number, but it certainly has been supportive of the expansion in value add that we have talked about. That 25% in terms of a future investment, that is an interesting question because on one hand, I would say, yes, I think that is reasonable based on what we have seen over the past couple of years. But I will also admit that the demand does seem to be increasing in that value-add space, and we may decide to accelerate our investments in that area just because it is got such a great return. And in certain markets, particularly as we combine these two businesses, I think it is going to really unleash our capabilities to sell a broad swath of the market on value add, and I could see that increasing over time. A little early yet, to be honest, but I certainly I wouldn't be shy about putting more money into that, given our investment performance, our returns to date. Well, the fourth quarter results for SG&A are always a little dynamic as we true-up all of our year-end reserves and sort of do our final cleanup. So there is always a bit of that. Yes, I mean, I think the big story is not a surprise to anybody, it is the impact of commodities and what that does. As you look at our business, 30% to 40% of our products are exposed to that commodity fluctuation. And with those currently being up basically double where they were last year, you have got a pretty significant impact to the business. And that, of course, is going to reflect in the nature of your SG&A fall through, your percentages. There is an impact, right, the nature of what we have seen in the commission rates going up and down. The leverage has certainly benefited, but you also have the required reserves in the business and the increased commission dollars associated with those sales. So a little bit of flexing rather in those numbers, but nothing material has changed or there some area of concern. Yes, yes. Double underline the yes. Well, I think the opportunity for expanding value add and increasing demand in value add is usually around the labor side, right? I mean, in most cases, the supply of the product has not been the big issue. It certainly does limit their ability to sort of do it themselves when they can't get access. We have very good relationships with our vendors. We partner very closely with both the sell-through product vendors, but also the machine vendors. And being the size that we are, I think they see us as a good customer. And so we work with them to make sure our orders for the equipment that we need are in early and that we have a pipeline that we are ordering each year. So less concerned about our access. Although let's face it, all manufacturing has been pretty disrupted. So that is something that we are going to continue to stay well ahead of in order to make sure we don't have issues in that regard. But value add, it is been a problem this year. Windows and doors, in particular, have struggled. And not to throw stones at them, it is been a very difficult time. But that is certainly an area where we are hoping for a good, solid recovery because we believe in the demand story. Yes. It is a mix. Some markets, it absolutely helps us, and we are excited about what we are going to be able to do together and we will be able to add capacity. I mean the reality is if capacity in the market is constrained, it is because all of us are already constrained. So that will be a different challenge. Those markets where we don't play as much, there may be opportunities to do some of that. There is a lot to say grace over right now. Yes. So multifamily, we think, will settle down a little bit. We certainly were benefited by some projects that came through. The multifamily team has done a really nice job for us. We think it will slow down a bit, but continue to be a good area for us. And we are not anticipating - I know that there have been some market forecasts out there that are pretty depressing. We don't think it will be that bad for us. But it is certainly an area of the market - as you get closer to commercial, those larger scale projects have been more impacted by COVID and the dynamics of the marketplace than some of the smaller areas where we tend to focus for multifamily. So we are feeling pretty good about it. A pretty small part of our business overall, but we think it will be a tailwind. So two halves to your question. I would say the first part to your question is around kind of the performance of the business in terms of pricing. We certainly did better than we had done in the past. I think there are a couple of main reasons for that. The first of which I have tremendous gratitude and admiration for our team in terms of being able to execute, utilizing some of the tools we have been working on, utilizing all the experience that our teams have been very, very proactive, very aggressive in terms of responding to the marketplace. Getting those prices changed quickly, managing the costs and the inbound ordering, doing it in a very disciplined and quick reacting way, I think, was the biggest impact. I will also say that we certainly benefited from the headline nature of those commodity price increases. There wasn't anyone who didn't know. There wasn't anyone who could say, well, I'm not going to buy from you because it is expensive. And I was like, okay, well, you are not buying it from anybody else either because we have got a good position. We can get you the product that you want. If you would like it, this is what it costs. So I think that those combination of factors certainly was a huge benefit and the reason why we performed as well as we did. We generally don't try and break out for you the exact impact of commodities from an EBITDA perspective. We have talked about how much we felt was impacting for the third quarter in that 7.2% range. We think the fourth quarter, just to be explicit, we will be in the - 25% to 35% of our growth will be attributed to commodity inflation in the fourth quarter. Just as a general rule of thumb, we have talked about our fall through in that 12% to 15% range being roughly true for the impact of commodities up or down as well. So if you want to use some rough numbers, that is a good way to think about it, although I will tell you the exact math is a bit more painful. I have read the articles that people are now nesting and wanting a bigger home after being trapped. And I think we will have to see. I think there is maybe hope that things level out. I'm not sure it turns into a tailwind because of what Chad was talking about. We need those smaller homes, and we will get them. I think that expansion of that starter and move-up home part of the industry is great news, long overdue. Yes. So we have historically talked about SG&A being about 70% variable, about 30% fixed. Now the unique dynamic that you alluded to is this idea, that is based on real volume and not the sort of vagarities of commodities, if you will. So that is the only adjustment I would advise you to make sure you are keeping track of. But yes, we certainly have seen great leverage as a result of the expansion of commodities as well as great leverage off of the core, the core organic growth. Yes. I mean it is a great question. I think that each cycle is a bit different. The extreme nature of this one has certainly impacted the industry differently. We are going to be in a different demand profile, I would say, going into next year. So that could potentially change things as well. I think we have got to wait and see how it plays out. I do feel really good about the underlying core though, right. Our ability to manage pricing, our ability to get good leverage off of the business, our ability to continue to grow the underlying operations in the strong demand environment and the movement toward value add, I think are all very positive tailwinds or data points for that discussion. But we just have to wait and see. Well, there is certainly been a lot of conversation about it, no question. I think there are some ebbs and flows and some customers have gone away from the price locks or tried to. I think some of us in the industry in the distribution space have looked for ways to create a bit more stability in terms of the way we buy, whether it be directly from the mills or contractual relationships. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the options markets are really all that helpful just based on the way that they work right now. So there have even been discussions about how that might change in the future. I'm optimistic that in our new structure as the combined entity with BMC, that might be something we could even continue to follow down that path. Our ability to be a positive influence and a stabilizing influence in this industry, I think, is enhanced with our scale and with our ability to act in a coordinated way. So we will absolutely continue to look at that. And certainly, some interesting models based on some folks have done out there. Sure. Yes. I mean we had talked about a roughly $65 million target out there for ourselves. I think we are probably about halfway based on what we talked through up until prior year. Continuing to make progress in that space. We certainly see the best opportunities, the biggest opportunities for ourselves in a couple of key areas. I think that, that pricing management and pricing discipline, sort of taking the inconsistencies and inefficiencies out of our process is still being a potential forward-looking benefit for our business. Excited to see what we can do partnered together with BMC in that way as well. And then I think our ability to continue to enhance our internal operations using digital tools, processes, whether that be as we interact with our customers, but even back office. We certainly still see tremendous value going forward, leveraging best practices, leveraging technology and then a combination of those two things, we think will be really impactful. So certainly feel very good about our ability to deliver and go beyond those targets we would issued back in 2018. So certainly expecting that to be an important part of the way the business is going to run post merger as well."

[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available at www.bldr.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Binit Sanghvi, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBinit Sanghvi: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call today are Chad Crow, Chief Executive Officer; and Peter Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the slide presentation referenced on this call is available on the Investor Relations section of the Builders FirstSource website at bldr.com.

I will now turn the call over to Chad Crow.\nChad Crow: Thank you, Binit. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We are incredibly proud of our team\u2019s hardwork and dedication to excellence over the past several months. A significant portion of our senior leadership as well as our regional and local managers have been with us for well over a decade, giving us a collective understanding of how to effectively manage during crisis. Last quarter, we outlined our preparedness to address the unprecedented environment from a safety, operational and financial perspective. Our team rose to the occasion and delivered strong results all around. We proactively managed our business at the local level to quickly rightsize our operations where necessary to ensure that we continue to safely and effectively deliver critical products and services to our customers, all the while adjusting to a ever changing market landscape and keeping as many of our team members as possible working through the pandemic. Our focus execution allowed us to take advantage of strong housing fundamentals to produce the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA in our history. Order volumes recovered as we moved through the quarter and we are pleased we were able to bring back almost all of our furloughed employees. Many states in the Northeast, Northwest and Midwest, initially placed restrictions on homebuilding. Those limitations have now been lifted, so we are back to work in all of our locations around the country. The homebuilding markets have been resilient, improving housing starts, record low mortgage rates, and the shift towards suburban living are all positive fundamentals that continue to support demand for our products and services. In June, we experienced a sharp sequential rebound in sales, and we were appropriately resourced to capture that demand. The dramatic improvement as we ended the quarter gives us momentum as we enter the second half of the year. We acknowledge macroeconomic uncertainties remain with high unemployment, and COVID hotspots slowing the recovery in certain regions. However, as we look across our national footprint, we believe we are exceptionally well situated to take advantage of the homebuilding tailwinds, that continued into July. We remain in our ability to outperform within our industry, through organic and inorganic growth opportunities that enhance our ability to partner with our customers. We have the balance sheet to support our growth ambitions ending the quarter with total liquidity of 1.2 billion, up to 200 million since our last update in May. Our strong cash flow continued to strengthen our balance sheet, at the same time provide dry powder for future M&A. We were especially pleased to surpass the low end of our long term targeted ratio of net financial debt to adjusted EBITDA up of 2.5 times achieving 2.3 times as of the end of the quarter. Moving on to our year-to-date update on slide four. It is important to note that we have been able to demonstrate the particular strengths of our strategy, team and platform during this period of fluctuating demand. Our ability to deliver record adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2020 is a direct result of our national footprint, unmatched scale and manufacturing capability and exceptional sales force. The breadth of our product portfolio also supported higher demand in all three of our end markets. For the first six months of the year, sales volume grew by nearly 4%, of which approximately 3% was from our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year. Value-added product categories increased in sales volume by an estimated 4% in the first six months, as we continue to realize the benefits from our years of strategic investment. Commodity inflation and one additional selling day each contributed approximately 1% of sales, which led to an increase in reported net sales of 6%. Despite the market volatility we grew adjusted EBITDA by 5% compared to the same year-to-date period last year. Thanks again to our team's disciplined execution and quick reaction to the dynamic local market conditions. Our operational excellence initiatives remain on track. As we mentioned on previous calls, these best practices are being implemented throughout the organization and are making our company more agile and easier to do business with. Key initiatives in process include investments in distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back office process efficiencies, and Information System enhancements. The rollout of our pricing optimization has been particularly successful now covering 15 of our major markets. Where implemented, we have provided our associates with faster and more accurate pricing information, along with customized marketing tools and analytics, enabling us to execute our strategy on a local level. Our delivery optimization system covers approximately 70% of our sales and has measurably improved our distribution network in terms of speed, uptime and reliability. Our innovative customer portal, My BFS Builder is designed to complement our first class face-to-face customer service and continues to see higher adoption rates. Our expanding network of high margin value added offsite component manufacturing facilities remain core to our strategy. We intend to use a portion of our cash flow to continue investing in value added growth capacity through both organic and acquisition opportunities. This includes our investment plans related to Greenfield facilities, new trust lines and existing plants, store facility expansions and machinery and systems and dozens of our value-added operations, such as our newly commissioned state of-the-art truss plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Through consistent execution of our long range strategic plan, we will continue to add our differentiated offering of industry leading value added capacity that enhanced our geographic footprint, technological capabilities and integrated partnerships with our customers. Our customers value our commitment to high caliber service and in particular, our ability to continually invest in service capabilities throughout the cycle, which we believe is a differentiator for Builders FirstSource. During the first half of the year, we tightened cash discipline to enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity. In the second half, we are focused on disciplined cash deployment to advance our growth strategy with a focus on value-added acquisitions that further strengthens our position within the industry. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on the fact that today marks the five-year anniversary of our ProBuild. When I think back on what we have accomplished and the great company we've become as a result of that acquisition there is much to be proud of. But I almost hate even using the word acquisition, because we accomplished, what we accomplished was only possible because thousands of our team members from both companies chose to forget which jersey they were wearing prior to July 31 2015, rolled up their sleeves and said, let's get this thing done. And we did. I think what I am most proud of, is the fact that we did what we said we were going to do from the start. If you recall, we were over six times levered when the deal closed, and a lot of people thought we were crazy, and that we would never survive. From the start, we said our top priorities were to delever, integrate and achieve our synergy targets. And we did plain and simple. So to all our team members, thank you for what we accomplished over the past five years. And to all those who have invested in us five years ago to make the transaction possible, thank you as well. Now, time for reflection is over. Everyone back to work. All yours Peter.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by also recognizing our team's work to quickly adjust cost, adapt to local market conditions and executed actively to deliver a record quarter. I will quickly review our second quarter results, and then provide you an overview of how we intend to manage going forward. We had $1.9 billion in net sales in the second quarter with core organic sales declining 2.1%. Core organic excludes the acquisitions and commodity impacts from that sale to give an indication of the underlying performance of the business. As previously disclosed, during the month of April, we experienced a core organic sales decline in the high single-digit percent range. However, as the quarter progressed order activity showed a smaller drop and a stronger recovery than we initially expected. In June, core organic growth rebounded up low single-digits, reflecting what we believe to be a release in pent up demand. For the quarter, our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added 2.5% to net sale. Commodity price inflation added another 1.8%. As a result, net sales in total increased by 2.2%. Demand for our value added product categories continued to outperform within our respective markets. Although higher demand in most parts of the country was disproportionately offset by the impact of COVID-19 in the hardest hit areas. Our gross margin percentage was 26.6%, just over the high end of our previously communicated expectation of 26% to 26.5%, due to the disciplined execution and rapid adjustments by our team as the quarter progressed. The 60 basis point decline compared to the prior year period was a result of the expected normalization we had discussed in our calls, mainly in our lumber and lumber sheet goods products categories. Since May, we have experienced sharp commodity inflation in lumber and panel costs. So please keep in mind the mechanics of our margins as we have discussed on prior calls. Commodity cost inflation causes short term gross margin percentage headwinds, and prices spike relative to our short term pricing commitments that we provide customers. It usually takes one to two quarters for the margins to normalize at the new prices. As a result of the speed and magnitude of this temporary headwinds, we expect our gross margin percentage to be pressured in the third quarter before recovering to more normalized levels over the typical one to two quarter lag. Ultimately, we will benefit from higher gross margin dollars generated from the inflationary impact on that sale. Interest expense decreased by $2.6 million to $26.8 million compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of one-time items related to debt instruments and extinguishment in the prior year period, Interest expense increased by $1.7 million due to a higher outstanding debt balance as we proactively increased our liquidity and financial flexibility in light of COVID uncertainty. Second quarter EBITDA increased $16.3 million from a year ago to $161.9 million, and 11% improvement. As Chad mentioned, this is the highest quarterly EBITDA in our history, driven by our cost management measures both at the corporate and local levels, combined with the improving demand through the quarter. The reduction in variable expenses related to compensation, travel and entertainment and fuel costs contributed to an 8.3% EBITDA margin compared to a 7.1% margin in the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $79.2 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared with $71.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase of $5.1 million share was primarily driven by the improved operating results, partially offset by higher adjusted interest expense. On slide six, I would like to highlight the strength of our business, driven this quarter by the focused execution of our team, allowing us to partner with customers to supply critical products and services as demand recovered. Economic slowdowns mainly in the northeast, Northwest, Midwest and Florida significantly impacted demand across our product categories, partially offset by growth in the remainder of our footprint. This was especially true on our manufactured product category, which was disproportionately impacted by the geographies for most by the pandemic. Excluding those impacted regions, our manufactured products sales increased in the quarter. Overall value added for organic sales declined by approximately 3% offset by the contribution of our strategic acquisition. We are committed to continuing the expansion of our network of manufacturing components facility strategically located across the country. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased to have added a state-of-the art manufacturing facility in Spartanburg South Carolina during the quarter, extending our industry leading position to 65 manufacturing facilities. We expect that approximately 25% of our total 2020 capital expenditures will be invested in our value-add growth initiatives and expansion of our production capacity. Our second quarter core organic sales declined by an estimated 4% in the single-family new construction end market compared to a decrease of 13% in overall U.S. single-family starts. Although we performed better than expected in the majority of our market, the growth was limited by the impact of COVID in certain parts of the country. Core organic growth in the R&R and other end market grew 4% as we saw relative strength in the western part of the country and began to lap the unfavorable tariff impact in the upper Midwest in the prior year period. Multifamily core organic declined by 2%, largely due to the timing of some large projects impacted by the shutdown. Turning to our financial flexibility on page eight, a key factor driving our value creation in recent years has been our strong cash generation. During the first half of 2020, we produced free cash flow of approximately $115 million. The aggressive actions we discussed last quarter to preserve cash, including an initial reduction in discretionary CapEx spending and increased vigilance around working capital or key drivers in our year-to-date performance. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow continued to represent more than 90% of adjusted EBITDA. It just had a clear impact on net leverage, which improved by about half a churn versus prior year to 2.3 times representing it to lowest levels since the 2015 ProBuild acquisition. Since our last call, our liquidity improved by an additional $200 million to $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting our positive free cash flow. At the onset of the pandemic in April, our primary objective was to preserve cash. With better clarity around the market, and without ample liquidity, we are resuming our investment in capital priorities, including acquisitions, and growth CapEx primarily focused on value-added growth initiatives. Our deal pipeline remains robust and we are focused on investing for the long term. Turning to our outlet on slide nine, our first half results reflect our experience managing through cycles and the resilience of our business to generate growth. Our first half results also demonstrate a positive overall homebuilding environment, supported by a positive tailwind and rising demand across our diverse national footprint, which continued into July. Based on this backdrop, we are introducing an outlook for the third quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be flat year-over-year at approximately $160 million. We anticipate core organic sales growth to be in the mid-single digit range year-over-year for the third quarter. New housing demand has proven to be resilient in nearly all localities where we operate, which provides the basis for our outlook. Amid all of the macro uncertainties, we are guiding to a balanced growth assumption while positioning our business to take advantage of potential upside opportunities. Keep in mind, our core organic growth outlook reflects our core sales performance and excludes the sales contribution from acquisitions as well as specific commodity inflation in the coming quarters. Over the past few months, we have been managing the rapid commodity inflation incurring in our industry. As I mentioned earlier, we expect our third quarter gross margin percentages to be below our normalized levels due to that inflation. We anticipate our gross margin percentage to be in the low 24% range for the third quarter compared to our normalized levels of over 26% when commodities are at more stable prices. This margin decline is a temporary headwind as we have demonstrated in the past. We will see a quarter or two of margin pressure during the inflationary period along with increasing gross margin dollars. I'll note that we experienced a similar pressure on gross margins in mid-2018 when inflation spiked. As the inflation subsided, we recovered that margin with above normal margins during the deflationary period. Back since the beginning of 2018, through the second quarter of 2020, our gross margins tend to average approximately 26%, which is in line with our normalised level and is consistent with how we manage our business through commodity swing. Since 2018, we have generated nearly $1 billion of operating cash flow, and we fully expect to build upon that cash generation through year end 2020. We continue to expect our cash interest will be in the $110 million to $115 million range for the full year of 2020. With our growth projects underway again, we now expect capital expenditures to be in the $100 million to $110 million range for the full year. Looking beyond 2020, the structural advantages of our business remain intact. We delivered solutions that make our customers more productive and efficient. We have deeper and more integrated relationships with our customers than ever before. We are much more than a supplier of commodity lumber. We are a highly valued partner to many very sophisticated builders, delivering labor savings and just in time delivery of critical building materials, helping them maintain a streamlined supply chain. These higher margin value-added offerings represent the largest portion of our business and the focus of our growth. With our solid financial position, we believe, we are uniquely positioned to accelerate our profitable growth through underlying market expansion, supplemented by targeted acquisitions, and operational excellence initiatives to accomplish our long term objectives and capture underlying market growth. We therefore affirm our previously communicated long range plan targets, which remain on track to be achieved by 2022. We have full confidence in our business to be the supplier of choice for building materials and value added products in the months and years to come. Our strong financial position, coast-to-coast geographically diversified product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities and strong partnerships with customers are unmatched competitive advantages in any market environment. I would especially like to thank our Builders FirstSource team for their dedication to our company, our customers and our communities. Operator, we can now open up the call for Q&A\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We can now go to our first question, that comes from Matthew Bouley of Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. Start off with a question on the guide for Q3. You're saying, I guess core organic growth in the mid-single digit range and I think I mentioned Peter, that June was up low single digit, just any color I got from how July organic is trended, and sort of just what are the underlying housing start expectations that are that are informing that guide?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I\u2019m start off and let Chad finish up. The performance in June, July is obviously not done yet. But looking like it'll be right in that same range maybe a little bit better. We had talked earlier about the potential for an air pocket, wondering what the recovery might look like if there were some pent up demand from the sort of timeframe when everything was pretty much shut down. Things have been not telling you anything you don't already know, surprisingly resilient. And we're very pleased with sort of the overall sustainability of the trend that things have come back. And as you've heard, as we have heard, from many of the builders around the country, there is a tremendous amount of optimism. There's no strength in that homebuilding market. So that's really the rationale that we're giving ourselves for that mid-single digits third quarter growth number in that single family space. It's still, a little bit open, in terms of where it will land could be better. As always, there's enough volatility in COVID land where it could be worse, but we were feeling pretty good about it on balance and the order rates to what we're seeing.\nChad Crow: Yes, and I'll just add. You've seen the commentary from the builders and in recent weeks, very, very positive. The traffic is up, new orders are up. Just a little bit surprisingly, it's been so resilient, and there still seems to be a lot of tailwind. Rates are low. I think with everything going on in our country right now, people desire more space. In many cases commutes are becoming less of a factor for people, which allows them to move further from downtown areas. I think there's probably a lot of people with aging parents looking to create space for them, as opposed to, looking to put them in long term care facilities. So there's just a lot of tailwind right now, people aren't traveling as much. A lot of -- I think they've given more thought to their living condition with the dynamic that are going on right now. So as Peter said, with any guide or forecast, there's potential for upside or downside we always try to be pretty measured about our guidance and leave ourselves a little legroom and then this quarter is no different and we're feeling really good about how things are shaping up right now.\nMatthew Bouley: Perfect. Thank you for that. And then I guess on the gross margin side, you can clearly see the progress over the years. The Q3 guide it's better than where margins bottomed in the second quarter of 2018 And you mentioned this one to two quarter lag, back to normalization. And so my question is, with all the progress you've made, is there any reason that you think that, the pace of margin recovery might not be any might not be faster than what we saw at that time? Or should we think that hey, look, it is what it is, lumbers inflating and let's not get too ahead of ourselves on this. So, really just asking about how we should think about that pace of normalization? Thanks, guys.\nChad Crow: Well, I'll start out Peter can add a few lines but. We've seen this movie before, right? 2018 was one of the most recent example. We get compressed for a period of time and then when things flatten out or we start to see deflation, we get paid back, and then so Q3 is going to be a quarter of margin compression, but with the tailwinds we are seeing in housing and, and the higher prices once we get our pricing got up, it could set up to be some really nice quarter just like we saw it.\nPeter Jackson: And we're certainly pushing ourselves to get better and better about managing price and doing so efficiently as possible quite ready to sign up for faster than our one two quarters. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it for now. But certainly internally, that's our goal for ourself.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay, thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Echo the commentary around best results here in a challenging time. The first question I had is on manufactured products, I think, Peter, you made a comment about how some of the impact on the optics around growth there where we're potentially mixed related, but I think if we if we look at that \u2013 I mean we\u2019re not off on acquisition contribution. I think the volume and manufactured products may have been down high single digits ish, which would have lagged the rest of the business. So good. Just want to clarify that. And then if you could provide some additional color on those mix impacts, but also just then on the relative growth trends you've seen over the course of June and July in manufactured products?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, absolutely. You heard it right, that the nature of the decline in manufactured products is sort of that, mid-single digit in that organic components. So yes, we did see a decline. The biggest reason for that and we dug into the numbers was around the fact that the other was a higher amount of, on a mixed basis, a higher mix of that manufactured product in the markets where we got hit the hardest. So was unfortunate it's I think, representative of opportunity delays in front of us as those markets were covered. But, an area like, the Northwest, specific northwest of Florida for example, that's a manufactured products business is a great business for us. We've great partnerships. We've sort of proven the value proposition, and it's a higher percent -- a much higher percentage of the mix in those markets. So then when we work hard in those markets, disproportionately, that's why it shows up in that organic number. But still feel very good about the business. It's not a structural issue, it continues to grow. In other parts of the country, it continues to be just as successful or more so in every market where we sell it versus the core and overall business.\nChad Crow: Yes, and I'll just add. I agree with what Peter said, part of it was geographical We were shut down in areas where we have a very strong component presence. But you've also got to consider when builders hit the brakes? Like homes that were already under construction, we kept shipping to new home started, dropped and the first thing we lose there is the component business, right. So that's part of it as well. I'll tell you that moving into the pandemic, so around the first week of March, to the depths of the pandemic, as far as new truck orders coming in, we dropped over 50%. Our orders coming into the truss plants now are back to a level equivalent to where they were at the beginning of March before the pandemic, and a solid double digit higher than where they were a year ago. So I have -- I have zero concerns about our components.\nMike Dahl: That's great to hear. Thanks for that color. My second question is really around the reinstated long term guidance, and it's nice to see that reinstated. On the other hand, I think prior on admission, there's still some uncertainty there. So the question is really if we look at the two key results through Q2 guide, it seems like you're tracking towards like 525 to 550 million in EBITDA this year. And that still takes 40% plus growth over the next two years to get that to get that long term EBITDA goal of 750. So has your high level framework changed at all around kind of based business? What kind of market growth was internal initiatives and then what component would potentially be M&A included in that?\nPeter Jackson: First of all, exciting. And then I\u2019m looking forward to it, and now it's fundamental structure of what we thought about earlier this year is not changed. We are -- when we go back there \u2013 and I know as you have not talked about this in the past, when we're going through and looking at the variety of models that we pull together to look at this business over time. We certainly have a number of different levers that we can pull, in addition to what I would describe as sort of a core underlying mark. Right. Of course, we're going to be heavily influenced by single family. Of course, we're going to be impacted by a commodity, sort of core to who we are. But we also have the ability to really control our own fate in a lot of ways. Investments that we're making in the core business that\u2019s value-add strategy that we've been executing on has been very effective. Now with our being even below our targeted leverage ratio, we have tremendous liquidity and terms of this opportunity to go after what we believe to be a very, very healthy pipe of M&A opportunities. And operational excellence continues to perform. We continue to make progress. We continue to see an operation that knows how to and wants to get better and to have better results each quarter. So, really, while we were -- I think, prudently conservative by pulling the 2020 guidance last quarter as we run our numbers and looked at where we're at and where we can be, what things are sort of coming together for us. We feel very good about 2022. We think that is just the area is absolutely attainable and we have line of sight to how we're going to get there. And as I mentioned, it doesn't -- everything doesn't have to work together perfectly for us to hit that number. We have to continue working and doing what we're good at.\nMike Dahl: That's great. Thank you.\nChad Crow: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Keith, perhaps you're on mute.\nKeith Hughes: Yes. Can you hear me now? Sorry, I had to connection problem.\nOperator: Yes. Please go ahead .\nKeith Hughes: Okay, sorry. Miss you again. On acquisitions, you talk about for some time doing tuck-ins, if you could talk about what regions, what products, things of that nature, you would look to do acquisitions? And what you, at this point in cycle, be open to something larger than a tuck-ins?\nChad Crow: We're always open to that. In many ways, one large one can be easier than 20 or 30. small ones, and we've seen both clearly. But yes, that's certainly always something we're open to. At this point in the cycle we do have a lot of liquidity. It may be using more equity at this point in the cycle would be proven. But sure, that's something we've always been open to.\nKeith Hughes: Second question, on these smaller tuck-ins. Is there a region that you try [Indiscernible]?\nChad Crow: You sort of broke up there for a second, Keith. It sounds like you were asking what regions might we think about tuck-ins for?\nKeith Hughes: Yes, what regions. That's correct.\nChad Crow: Well, you can look at the map and see whether there's holes in our footprint. So, part of our motivation is regional. But I think just as importantly as product mix. We're much more inclined to go after the company with a high mix of value add. So it's kind of a combination of those two factors. In general, we're under penetrated in my view in the western part of the country versus the east. But as I said, value add is just as critical on my mind.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.\nChad Crow: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.\nTrey Grooms: Hey, good morning.\nChad Crow: Good morning, Trey.\nTrey Grooms: So geographically, just kind of wondering, I think that definitely held in better clearly. During the earlier days of the pandemic, there was things vary pretty widely, as you mentioned. And your value added products, it sounds like, when you do see some geographic changes in demand that can have an impact there just giving your exposure. So I guess, my question is, can you touch on kind of the geographic areas now that things are starting to kind of move again. Where you're seeing relative strength or weakness now and geographically and what that means for that value-added mix?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yes. So, just to recap what we were saying in the script, right, the Northeast, obviously, kind of the upper Midwest, the Michigan area, in particular, the Pacific Northwest and then later on as we got past the initial impact, we also saw slowdown in Florida. Those were all I would say the areas that were highlighted and I think truly saw the biggest impact for us as a company. When it comes to recovery, I would say, in Pacific Northwest has bounce back very quickly. I would say, the Michigan and upper Midwest area has definitely stabilized and started to march back. Northeast is still suffering quite a bit. I mean, there's no way around it. They continue to have very strict controls. I think the population in general has suffered more and has states slower. So that recovery is underway, but certainly not back to normal levels up there yet. In Florida, I think they're still perhaps in the middle of some of the uncertainty, given the exposure to tourism, they've certainly seen a lot of concern, a lot of the declines for their core businesses. And so they are still, again, they're on the road back, but haven't been far to get go. When looking at the relative exposure in those areas for manufactured products, obviously, Florida is important to us. But so it's the Northeast. There are some corridors of real good strength there for us. So it will be a recovery that you'll see and we're confident in that sort of growth over time in the manufactured products. But those couple of markets will be a more of a progression back to normal rather than a quick snap back. But I think it's important to know that, if you can look at the overall value-added products. If you exclude those target regions, we were up low single digit. So the rest of the country is still even with the suppressed starts numbers and some of the concerns still growing as we would expect it to be in overtime.\nTrey Grooms: Got it. All right. Thanks for all the color. Appreciate it. And I guess as a follow up. So on the SG&A line, it was lower as a percent of sales then what we would have thought, especially given that strong top line you guys put up and just everything that we've done. But we'd be kind of understand some of the tailwinds may abate. But with that said, I know, you guys have a culture of focusing on lower cost and running a tight ship. So I guess, is there any levers that you guys had pulled up in SG&A through this pandemic, and over the last several months that you could continue to see or continue to benefit from in the coming quarters?\nPeter Jackson: I'm glad you highlight that, Trey. I would say this is really just a testament to the discipline that our teams live and breathe each day. We went out with some messaging, sort of just some reminders and some playbooks to folks. When we saw that sort of a concern in the shutdown setting, just coaching people on how to manage through it, right, and what our team just did a great job resizing the business when it was appropriate, making sure that we were cutting costs, being disciplined. And obviously, some of the things we did to give ourselves a little extra flexibility more broadly as a company we talked about that, delaying wages, salary cuts for executives. Sorry, delaying wage increases and salary cuts for executives. Those were things that we thought were necessary just to give ourselves that flexibility. Clearly we did very, very well as we went through that sort of pause period. Since then, with the recovery that we've seen, we've reinstituted, the merit increases, we restored all those cuts that we made. And the nature of the resizing of the business is very specific to the locations. So we try to retain the staffing, making sure we weren't hurting ourselves strategically. Our ability to compete, our ability to win, we didn't want to undermine that by being too aggressive, because we don't believe that we've allowed ourselves to get fat in these markets. There wasn't a ton of a cut. So what you saw at the end of the day was I think some real flexibility in the core around comm that some of that will come back, obviously in terms of expenses. You saw about a third of our overall benefit being TBD. Now that ones bit more time to play out. The question remains, will it ever get back to normal? Will we ever travel like we used to? TBD, but certainly that we anticipate will come back to some degree over time. Then third, that was really the fuel expense. And obviously, there's been some volatility in the cost of fuel. So that will normalize to wherever it's going to normalize to over time, maybe not right away on that one either. But we didn't go back through this organization and make any real structural changes or massive cuts. Our focus was on making sure we were responding and being ready to move forward. At this point that seems things played out pretty well.\nTrey Grooms: Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. And best of luck.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Trey.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke of Deutsche Bank.\nSeldon Clarke: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Can you give us some lineups what your longer term guidance assumes in terms of starts? Understand there -- you mentioned there are numbers of way you can get there. But just from a high level, can you give us some more detail around what type of support you will need from the macro?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So, when we first brought out that $750 million EBITDA target we were referring to before. We were pretty explicit about putting a $1.1 million single family start number on there. However, earlier this year, we've come back and said, we have enough levers where we think we can get to that number even with just a healthy single family starts environment. It doesn't have to get to that million one number. So way we think about it is really those opportunities to control our own fate will be very, very impactful and perhaps as much as what we anticipate the continued recovery and starts today. So we talked about that, obviously, the M&A opportunities, what we are committed to staying within our stated range. We've got quite a bit of room there, where we have opportunities to grow our value-added with both greenfield and capacity work. Certainly that's a strong growth opportunity for us. And the operational excellence initiatives we've talked about right, whether it would be getting better and more disciplined. The pricing getting better and more effective in our distribution and logistics management, or even just opportunities to reduce costs and become more efficient in the back office. We think there are certainly ways that it can get us to that. We're not 100% dependent on that single family starts.\nSeldon Clarke: Okay. So on the M&A side, are you seeing -- have you've identified more opportunities? Are you seeing an increased willingness or valuations that come down. What's really driving the sort of increased optimism there?\nChad Crow: Well, the pipeline is full. It's been pretty full for the last few quarters. Obviously, there was a bit of a pause and in what type of diligence work we were doing, when things were shut down. But we brought that back up. There's just a lot of good businesses out there right now. And we clearly have a strong balance sheet to go after them. And so that's why we've got -- we are a little more optimistic. Now we've got a more optimistic tone on what we think we'll be able to do in the coming years from an acquisition standpoint.\nSeldon Clarke: Anyway, you could just expand a little bit on what's driving that optimism?\nPeter Jackson: So I guess, I'll give you an example without naming any names, where you are -- our internal model for valuations that we've been using and refining over the years certainly requires us to understand our weighted average cost of capital and make sure that the returns that we're seeing are making sense, but even risk we're taking in one of those deals. And what we're experiencing right now is that we are consistently bringing, seeing deals brought to pass by our regional management teams that look at really nice businesses that we think would be a great fit for us around the country. They're tuck-ins, right? So you may not be very excited about it at the top level, but we're seeing an accumulation of these deals and when we put them through our models and start speaking with the leadership teams of these targets, we thing there's a -- there are great opportunities. The valuations make sense. The return are great. The teams fit together and we think that it will continue to sort of accumulate into competitive advantages. We bring together sort of that model of our product portfolio, the capabilities that we bring with our national footprint, opportunities to introduce value-add or expanded value-add market. That's -- I would say, the accumulation of those factors is where that optimism comes from the list and the way that list is being sort of vetted through our processes as we continue to accelerate our M&A focus. We're ready to go.\nSeldon Clarke: Yes. Okay. That sounds good. Appreciate it.\nPeter Jackson: Sure.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jay McCanless of Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: Good morning everyone.\nPeter Jackson: Hey, Jay.\nJay McCanless: Hey, good morning. So I got a two-part question on lumber and then one as a follow-up. I guess, could you talk about what benefit you're seeing on the top line from commodity inflation thus far in the quarter? And then also maybe talk about when we think about your input costs for lumber? What's the spread between two before framing lumber versus sheet goods?\nChad Crow: So, maybe I can start. I would tell you that our Q2 results, the commodity is a slight tailwind. Keep in mind that dynamics, you saw a pretty good fall at the beginning of the quarter in prices and then a pretty good run out towards the end. So net-net it sort of averaged out, not a lot of impact and really started to accumulate if you've got into May. That's where the [Indiscernible] really starting to hit on May through today. Now the split of our exposure and we talked about commodities being right around 40% of our sales and prior quarters obviously now increase a bit as those increase prices start to change the mix in our business. But if you look at that 40% of our overall sales being commodity exposed and internally its 70/30 mix between lumber and panels. Again, anytime you got a highly commoditized component of your business that can be the most pressure probably in that space, the most commoditized and its probably [Indiscernible] of the panels. But that's sort of a broad-brush response.\nJay McCanless: Got it. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, just wondering --I guess, did you guys quantify how much in one time savings you saw from some the cost actions during 2Q that are probably going to come back in 3Q?\nPeter Jackson: Most of the $14 million beat in the second quarter, I would say were based on actions that are going to come back over time. I would say maybe further that will come back right away based on things people already done that are attributable to TV will take some time to phase back and unlikely they bounce back in the third quarter. Although I starting to eat away at it as things start to losing up in certain markets. And then, you'll -- I think you could probably estimate that better than I can. And those are the major components.\nChad Crow: Hey, Jay, I just want to add a little follow up to your commodity question. When we look at Q3, and it's kind of difficult to estimate, but right now our best guess is Q3 sales will be positively impacted due to inflation somewhere between 5% and 7%. And then, of course, we'll probably have another 2% or so year-over-year growth due to acquisition. So I just wanted to make sure you have those components.\nJay McCanless: Appreciated. Thank you. Thank you guys for taking my questions.\nChad Crow: Thanks Jay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger of D.A Davidson.\nKurt Yinger: Yes. Good morning everyone, and appreciate you taking my questions.\nChad Crow: Good morning, Kurt.\nKurt Yinger: I just want to start off - yes, good morning. On the gross margin front, you guys came into the year 26% to 26.5% kind of normalized. And I think lumber was maybe 400 bucks per thousand. Obviously, it\u2019s a moving target. But if we were to think about just structurally higher lumber price and maybe $500, what type of impact would that have on the normalized gross margin outlook, just with commodities naturally being arger percentage of sales?\nChad Crow: Yes. No, great question. As you know, we modeled that one quite a bit. It's about half to three quarters of a point based on current spot. It's been a meaningful move this year. There's no question. We'll have to see how long it lasts and how it plays out. But it's certainly an important change and one that we're we welcome. We just hope it sticks around this time.\nKurt Yinger: Well, it wasn't too bad on the other side of 2018 either so.\nChad Crow: Not bad at all.\nKurt Yinger: And my second one, it seems like over the past couple quarters you guys have start to see some real tangible benefits from some of those pricing tools. And I'm wondering how much opportunity you feel is left there. And relatedly, could you talk about which product categories or what previous shortfalls these tools really address?\nChad Crow: Sure. Yes. And I guess I just want to reiterate the fact that this pricing effort we're making is really just around being thoughtful, being organized, being efficient internally. I was describing areas where we're sort of closing the gaps. It's those moments when price change will come through the good or bad from a vendor and it's not being filtered all the way through the system to the quotation we're giving our customers. And while I'm sure the academics might prefer the fact that you need to increase prices and also decrease in prices, that's important as well, because you need to stay competitive and make sure you're winning the business. We want our salespeople to have the best information so they can compete and win in the marketplace. And when you're slow, you can put yourself in a position to fit out in profitability and in sales. So that's probably the biggest component. Being systematic always helps. You don't want to put yourself in a position where you've taken an approach that somehow harms a market or distorts the pricing. So that systematic approach we think it's absolutely beneficial. As we look at it, it's been a difficult process to adapt all of the tools, the system, the architecture to the way that we want to approach it going forward. I'm very, very impressed with both our operations and our IT teams for what they've been doing to pull that together. We've seen some very good progress with a couple more phases to come over the back half of this year. The markets where we've implemented so far have been pretty manual. So thus I can changes over time. It is a fairly modest percentage of the overall company. I think the new pricing structure is put in place. So we do expect it to continue to accumulate for us over the next year as we get some of those permanent changes to the It structure and allow the business to accelerate the use of that more broadly.\nPeter Jackson: And I'll just add, even just 50 basis points of margin improvement, that's real money. And part of it is, to some degree breaking old habits. I've always sold this with a 24% margins as well. Why can't it be 24.5. What can the market bear? So give them more tools to understand that. And then also knowing, bucketing your customers and knowing which customers are more expensive to serve and making sure you're getting proper margin and a net return on those customers. So a lot of it's just giving them the tools and the information to make those decisions much more quickly.\nKurt Yinger: Right. Makes a lot of sense. All right. Thank you guys. I'll turn it over.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Kurt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Gilbert of BTIG.\nRyan Gilbert: Hey, thanks, guys. First question is on the third quarter guide. So, I guess, looking back to prior years and there's been commodity inflation. We've seen that pressure on the gross margin. Operating margin has typically been flat or even improved on the year-over-year basis. But then just looking at that markets trying to kind of triangulate to operating margins and adjusted EBITDA and gross margin guide. It looks like you're expecting some pretty meaningful operating margin compression in the third quarter. And I'm just wondering why you think you can be flat or higher in 3G 2020 on an operating margin basis?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I think the -- probably the most direct answer to your question is the velocity of the change in commodities. The nature of those short term fixed price contracts certainly put us through a certain amount of exposure for a window of time. And these are unprecedented increases. You're up 20, 30 points a month. That's a very, very difficult thing to compensate for. So we're just recognizing that in the third quarter. Your point is right on there is some nice leverage that comes when the value of those commodities gets higher. And to the bottom line it's a no question of positive and one that we absolutely expect to flow through our P&L over time, but that's a short answer.\nChad Crow: Yes. I know. We could be looking at about 300 basis points decline in gross margin Q3 this year over last year. That's pretty hard to overcome from an operating margin standpoint. But as Peter said, we usually more than make that up in the following quarters.\nRyan Gilbert: Right. Completely understand. Okay. And then second question on structural components. Definitely good to hear that, you're up double digits on the year-over-year basis on trusses. I'm wondering just how the conversations with builders have been progressing in the third quarter, given that negotiating that backlogs are pretty full. cycle times are extending. I'm wondering if you're seeing more builders coming to you, interested in using components to get those cycle times back up?\nChad Crow: Yes, for sure. I mean, anytime labor's tied, as you mentioned, they've got all of a sudden the surge and their backlogs are bigger than normal. They're looking for ways to get those houses in the ground as quickly as possible. And so that just plays right into our strategy on the component side of the business. So that's why I said earlier, I have no concerns about our component business, very optimistic about what the future holds for that.\nRyan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And just lastly, if I could. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on what's going on in Florida. I think most of the commentary we've heard from the builders has been that, and the demands pretty positive down there. So has there been a change to that competitive landscape or anything in particular, you want to call out other than what you could earlier?\nPeter Jackson: I guess, I want to be a little bit thoughtful about how I answer this. There were certain important customers who acted more aggressively and less aggressively during the downturn than others. And the nature of some of those decisions certainly gave us some pause there. Back in this certain markets, they were particularly impacted, at least out of the gate or some of the more tourism impacted markets. All those markets have absolutely come back to the degree. There is a recovery underway. And I don't see that as a long term issue. But I do think there is a bit of a progression back to normal that is required for us to kind of see full help there. But we have a very strong footprint. Very good businesses. Our folks are doing a great job down there. It's certainly not a concern about the operation. It's just a matter of how quickly it ramps back to where we would consider to be strong again.\nRyan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Ramsay of Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsay: Good morning. I guess, question on Greenfield openings. How many have you done year to date? Do you have plans for more this year? Or is it still more of a focus on M&A?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So year to-date, I think we did just the one -- we had one that open sort of provided year end timelines, so its somewhere one or two. We have a couple more that are being built out. As far as timing and when they will open. So probably one to two more that will fall into this year. Again, kind of that year end timeline. It's a great time to kind of get that work done and get them starting to ramp up, because it's a bit of a slow season for us generally, but we do continue to focus on looking for areas for retail facilities and we expect to continue that going forward.\nSteven Ramsay: Okay. And then on repair and remodel volumes, I know you guys have some unique geographic exposure that drives that a little differently than the broader market. But our trends have been more resilient, maybe even didn't see quite the dip that new single family saw. Maybe just share the specific drivers for you guys in the quarter and if you have any visibility over Q3 into Q4?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yes. So the one thing I'll let you know. I'm sure you already know this. But just for the other listeners that our R&R and other includes kind of the commercial business as well. So I can tell you that we have sort of a tale of two cities there that where core R&R retail and remodel businesses is far stronger, more than doubled at 4% rate. And then the commercial businesses where we see some downturn and that's definitely offset. So we've got that retail footprint. Southern California is a great example, business is doing wonderfully, really performing well, ready and responding to the homeowner needs. And those markets are doing very, very well. As we mentioned in the script, the Midwest market is sort of leveled out. We've seen a bit of a headwind there in past years and it's been healthier. Certainly also seeing that tailwind from the overall trends nationally in the R&R space. Even Alaska's R&R market has done well. But that commercial part of our business where we do have projects. Again, that's got some pretty solid Alaska explorer. That has been part of it, as some of those projects have been either delayed or paused for whatever reason.\nSteven Ramsay: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Reuben Garner of the Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question.\nPeter Jackson: Good morning, Reuben.\nReuben Garner: Most of them have been answered. So I just have one quick one and if I missed it, sorry, we had some technical difficulties. But have you had any -- most of the cycle, the only -- the main driver of a slower recovery has been labor availability. Have you noticed any changes on the labor front? And then, I guess, in a related way, have you had any difficulty in getting any specific products? Do you see commodity availability or any other building products availability and issue in limiting growth or limiting and acceleration in growth in the coming quarters if the demand is there?\nChad Crow: Yes. Good questions. Haven't really noticed any changes in labor availability. Although I would not be surprised with the recent surge in new home orders that may get a little tighter and it may extend cycle times out a little more. We talked about that a little bit earlier on the call. From a product availability standpoint, most folks like us were running pretty lean as the pandemic hit, and we've stayed lean, prices have run and that kind of incentivizes you to remain lean, because you don't want to jump back in when prices are running if you don't have to. So that -- there has been some spotty supply issues, the bills cut back on their production when the pandemic hit and kind of got us in a situation we are right now where demand is strong and supplies limited. But nothing that I would say is disruptive. It's just something we're having to keep a closer eye on and be little more aggressive on the buying side in some markets where we're having trouble with some extended lead times, but nothing I would call significant at this point.\nReuben Garner: Great. Thanks again and congrats on the quarter. And good luck navigating through everything.\nChad Crow: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Crow for any additional or closing remarks.\nChad Crow: Thank you again for joining our call today. And we look forward to updating you on our future results. If you have any follow up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Peter or Binit. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chad Crow",
            "content": "Thank you, Binit. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We are incredibly proud of our team's hardwork and dedication to excellence over the past several months. A significant portion of our senior leadership as well as our regional and local managers have been with us for well over a decade, giving us a collective understanding of how to effectively manage during crisis. Last quarter, we outlined our preparedness to address the unprecedented environment from a safety, operational and financial perspective. Our team rose to the occasion and delivered strong results all around. We proactively managed our business at the local level to quickly rightsize our operations where necessary to ensure that we continue to safely and effectively deliver critical products and services to our customers, all the while adjusting to a ever changing market landscape and keeping as many of our team members as possible working through the pandemic. Our focus execution allowed us to take advantage of strong housing fundamentals to produce the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA in our history. Order volumes recovered as we moved through the quarter and we are pleased we were able to bring back almost all of our furloughed employees. Many states in the Northeast, Northwest and Midwest, initially placed restrictions on homebuilding. Those limitations have now been lifted, so we are back to work in all of our locations around the country. The homebuilding markets have been resilient, improving housing starts, record low mortgage rates, and the shift towards suburban living are all positive fundamentals that continue to support demand for our products and services. In June, we experienced a sharp sequential rebound in sales, and we were appropriately resourced to capture that demand. The dramatic improvement as we ended the quarter gives us momentum as we enter the second half of the year. We acknowledge macroeconomic uncertainties remain with high unemployment, and COVID hotspots slowing the recovery in certain regions. However, as we look across our national footprint, we believe we are exceptionally well situated to take advantage of the homebuilding tailwinds, that continued into July. We remain in our ability to outperform within our industry, through organic and inorganic growth opportunities that enhance our ability to partner with our customers. We have the balance sheet to support our growth ambitions ending the quarter with total liquidity of 1.2 billion, up to 200 million since our last update in May. Our strong cash flow continued to strengthen our balance sheet, at the same time provide dry powder for future M&A. We were especially pleased to surpass the low end of our long term targeted ratio of net financial debt to adjusted EBITDA up of 2.5 times achieving 2.3 times as of the end of the quarter. Moving on to our year-to-date update on slide four. It is important to note that we have been able to demonstrate the particular strengths of our strategy, team and platform during this period of fluctuating demand. Our ability to deliver record adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2020 is a direct result of our national footprint, unmatched scale and manufacturing capability and exceptional sales force. The breadth of our product portfolio also supported higher demand in all three of our end markets. For the first six months of the year, sales volume grew by nearly 4%, of which approximately 3% was from our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year. Value-added product categories increased in sales volume by an estimated 4% in the first six months, as we continue to realize the benefits from our years of strategic investment. Commodity inflation and one additional selling day each contributed approximately 1% of sales, which led to an increase in reported net sales of 6%. Despite the market volatility we grew adjusted EBITDA by 5% compared to the same year-to-date period last year. Thanks again to our team's disciplined execution and quick reaction to the dynamic local market conditions. Our operational excellence initiatives remain on track. As we mentioned on previous calls, these best practices are being implemented throughout the organization and are making our company more agile and easier to do business with. Key initiatives in process include investments in distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back office process efficiencies, and Information System enhancements. The rollout of our pricing optimization has been particularly successful now covering 15 of our major markets. Where implemented, we have provided our associates with faster and more accurate pricing information, along with customized marketing tools and analytics, enabling us to execute our strategy on a local level. Our delivery optimization system covers approximately 70% of our sales and has measurably improved our distribution network in terms of speed, uptime and reliability. Our innovative customer portal, My BFS Builder is designed to complement our first class face-to-face customer service and continues to see higher adoption rates. Our expanding network of high margin value added offsite component manufacturing facilities remain core to our strategy. We intend to use a portion of our cash flow to continue investing in value added growth capacity through both organic and acquisition opportunities. This includes our investment plans related to Greenfield facilities, new trust lines and existing plants, store facility expansions and machinery and systems and dozens of our value-added operations, such as our newly commissioned state of-the-art truss plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Through consistent execution of our long range strategic plan, we will continue to add our differentiated offering of industry leading value added capacity that enhanced our geographic footprint, technological capabilities and integrated partnerships with our customers. Our customers value our commitment to high caliber service and in particular, our ability to continually invest in service capabilities throughout the cycle, which we believe is a differentiator for Builders FirstSource. During the first half of the year, we tightened cash discipline to enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity. In the second half, we are focused on disciplined cash deployment to advance our growth strategy with a focus on value-added acquisitions that further strengthens our position within the industry. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on the fact that today marks the five-year anniversary of our ProBuild. When I think back on what we have accomplished and the great company we've become as a result of that acquisition there is much to be proud of. But I almost hate even using the word acquisition, because we accomplished, what we accomplished was only possible because thousands of our team members from both companies chose to forget which jersey they were wearing prior to July 31 2015, rolled up their sleeves and said, let's get this thing done. And we did. I think what I am most proud of, is the fact that we did what we said we were going to do from the start. If you recall, we were over six times levered when the deal closed, and a lot of people thought we were crazy, and that we would never survive. From the start, we said our top priorities were to delever, integrate and achieve our synergy targets. And we did plain and simple. So to all our team members, thank you for what we accomplished over the past five years. And to all those who have invested in us five years ago to make the transaction possible, thank you as well. Now, time for reflection is over. Everyone back to work. All yours Peter. Yes, and I'll just add. You've seen the commentary from the builders and in recent weeks, very, very positive. The traffic is up, new orders are up. Just a little bit surprisingly, it's been so resilient, and there still seems to be a lot of tailwind. Rates are low. I think with everything going on in our country right now, people desire more space. In many cases commutes are becoming less of a factor for people, which allows them to move further from downtown areas. I think there's probably a lot of people with aging parents looking to create space for them, as opposed to, looking to put them in long term care facilities. So there's just a lot of tailwind right now, people aren't traveling as much. A lot of -- I think they've given more thought to their living condition with the dynamic that are going on right now. So as Peter said, with any guide or forecast, there's potential for upside or downside we always try to be pretty measured about our guidance and leave ourselves a little legroom and then this quarter is no different and we're feeling really good about how things are shaping up right now. Well, I'll start out Peter can add a few lines but. We've seen this movie before, right? 2018 was one of the most recent example. We get compressed for a period of time and then when things flatten out or we start to see deflation, we get paid back, and then so Q3 is going to be a quarter of margin compression, but with the tailwinds we are seeing in housing and, and the higher prices once we get our pricing got up, it could set up to be some really nice quarter just like we saw it. Yes, and I'll just add. I agree with what Peter said, part of it was geographical We were shut down in areas where we have a very strong component presence. But you've also got to consider when builders hit the brakes? Like homes that were already under construction, we kept shipping to new home started, dropped and the first thing we lose there is the component business, right. So that's part of it as well. I'll tell you that moving into the pandemic, so around the first week of March, to the depths of the pandemic, as far as new truck orders coming in, we dropped over 50%. Our orders coming into the truss plants now are back to a level equivalent to where they were at the beginning of March before the pandemic, and a solid double digit higher than where they were a year ago. So I have -- I have zero concerns about our components. Thank you. We're always open to that. In many ways, one large one can be easier than 20 or 30. small ones, and we've seen both clearly. But yes, that's certainly always something we're open to. At this point in the cycle we do have a lot of liquidity. It may be using more equity at this point in the cycle would be proven. But sure, that's something we've always been open to. You sort of broke up there for a second, Keith. It sounds like you were asking what regions might we think about tuck-ins for? Well, you can look at the map and see whether there's holes in our footprint. So, part of our motivation is regional. But I think just as importantly as product mix. We're much more inclined to go after the company with a high mix of value add. So it's kind of a combination of those two factors. In general, we're under penetrated in my view in the western part of the country versus the east. But as I said, value add is just as critical on my mind. Thank you. Good morning, Trey. Well, the pipeline is full. It's been pretty full for the last few quarters. Obviously, there was a bit of a pause and in what type of diligence work we were doing, when things were shut down. But we brought that back up. There's just a lot of good businesses out there right now. And we clearly have a strong balance sheet to go after them. And so that's why we've got -- we are a little more optimistic. Now we've got a more optimistic tone on what we think we'll be able to do in the coming years from an acquisition standpoint. So, maybe I can start. I would tell you that our Q2 results, the commodity is a slight tailwind. Keep in mind that dynamics, you saw a pretty good fall at the beginning of the quarter in prices and then a pretty good run out towards the end. So net-net it sort of averaged out, not a lot of impact and really started to accumulate if you've got into May. That's where the [Indiscernible] really starting to hit on May through today. Now the split of our exposure and we talked about commodities being right around 40% of our sales and prior quarters obviously now increase a bit as those increase prices start to change the mix in our business. But if you look at that 40% of our overall sales being commodity exposed and internally its 70/30 mix between lumber and panels. Again, anytime you got a highly commoditized component of your business that can be the most pressure probably in that space, the most commoditized and its probably [Indiscernible] of the panels. But that's sort of a broad-brush response. Hey, Jay, I just want to add a little follow up to your commodity question. When we look at Q3, and it's kind of difficult to estimate, but right now our best guess is Q3 sales will be positively impacted due to inflation somewhere between 5% and 7%. And then, of course, we'll probably have another 2% or so year-over-year growth due to acquisition. So I just wanted to make sure you have those components. Thanks Jay. Good morning, Kurt. Yes. No, great question. As you know, we modeled that one quite a bit. It's about half to three quarters of a point based on current spot. It's been a meaningful move this year. There's no question. We'll have to see how long it lasts and how it plays out. But it's certainly an important change and one that we're we welcome. We just hope it sticks around this time. Not bad at all. Sure. Yes. And I guess I just want to reiterate the fact that this pricing effort we're making is really just around being thoughtful, being organized, being efficient internally. I was describing areas where we're sort of closing the gaps. It's those moments when price change will come through the good or bad from a vendor and it's not being filtered all the way through the system to the quotation we're giving our customers. And while I'm sure the academics might prefer the fact that you need to increase prices and also decrease in prices, that's important as well, because you need to stay competitive and make sure you're winning the business. We want our salespeople to have the best information so they can compete and win in the marketplace. And when you're slow, you can put yourself in a position to fit out in profitability and in sales. So that's probably the biggest component. Being systematic always helps. You don't want to put yourself in a position where you've taken an approach that somehow harms a market or distorts the pricing. So that systematic approach we think it's absolutely beneficial. As we look at it, it's been a difficult process to adapt all of the tools, the system, the architecture to the way that we want to approach it going forward. I'm very, very impressed with both our operations and our IT teams for what they've been doing to pull that together. We've seen some very good progress with a couple more phases to come over the back half of this year. The markets where we've implemented so far have been pretty manual. So thus I can changes over time. It is a fairly modest percentage of the overall company. I think the new pricing structure is put in place. So we do expect it to continue to accumulate for us over the next year as we get some of those permanent changes to the It structure and allow the business to accelerate the use of that more broadly. Yes. I know. We could be looking at about 300 basis points decline in gross margin Q3 this year over last year. That's pretty hard to overcome from an operating margin standpoint. But as Peter said, we usually more than make that up in the following quarters. Yes, for sure. I mean, anytime labor's tied, as you mentioned, they've got all of a sudden the surge and their backlogs are bigger than normal. They're looking for ways to get those houses in the ground as quickly as possible. And so that just plays right into our strategy on the component side of the business. So that's why I said earlier, I have no concerns about our component business, very optimistic about what the future holds for that. Yes. Good questions. Haven't really noticed any changes in labor availability. Although I would not be surprised with the recent surge in new home orders that may get a little tighter and it may extend cycle times out a little more. We talked about that a little bit earlier on the call. From a product availability standpoint, most folks like us were running pretty lean as the pandemic hit, and we've stayed lean, prices have run and that kind of incentivizes you to remain lean, because you don't want to jump back in when prices are running if you don't have to. So that -- there has been some spotty supply issues, the bills cut back on their production when the pandemic hit and kind of got us in a situation we are right now where demand is strong and supplies limited. But nothing that I would say is disruptive. It's just something we're having to keep a closer eye on and be little more aggressive on the buying side in some markets where we're having trouble with some extended lead times, but nothing I would call significant at this point. Thank you. Thank you again for joining our call today. And we look forward to updating you on our future results. If you have any follow up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Peter or Binit. Thank you."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by also recognizing our team's work to quickly adjust cost, adapt to local market conditions and executed actively to deliver a record quarter. I will quickly review our second quarter results, and then provide you an overview of how we intend to manage going forward. We had $1.9 billion in net sales in the second quarter with core organic sales declining 2.1%. Core organic excludes the acquisitions and commodity impacts from that sale to give an indication of the underlying performance of the business. As previously disclosed, during the month of April, we experienced a core organic sales decline in the high single-digit percent range. However, as the quarter progressed order activity showed a smaller drop and a stronger recovery than we initially expected. In June, core organic growth rebounded up low single-digits, reflecting what we believe to be a release in pent up demand. For the quarter, our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added 2.5% to net sale. Commodity price inflation added another 1.8%. As a result, net sales in total increased by 2.2%. Demand for our value added product categories continued to outperform within our respective markets. Although higher demand in most parts of the country was disproportionately offset by the impact of COVID-19 in the hardest hit areas. Our gross margin percentage was 26.6%, just over the high end of our previously communicated expectation of 26% to 26.5%, due to the disciplined execution and rapid adjustments by our team as the quarter progressed. The 60 basis point decline compared to the prior year period was a result of the expected normalization we had discussed in our calls, mainly in our lumber and lumber sheet goods products categories. Since May, we have experienced sharp commodity inflation in lumber and panel costs. So please keep in mind the mechanics of our margins as we have discussed on prior calls. Commodity cost inflation causes short term gross margin percentage headwinds, and prices spike relative to our short term pricing commitments that we provide customers. It usually takes one to two quarters for the margins to normalize at the new prices. As a result of the speed and magnitude of this temporary headwinds, we expect our gross margin percentage to be pressured in the third quarter before recovering to more normalized levels over the typical one to two quarter lag. Ultimately, we will benefit from higher gross margin dollars generated from the inflationary impact on that sale. Interest expense decreased by $2.6 million to $26.8 million compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of one-time items related to debt instruments and extinguishment in the prior year period, Interest expense increased by $1.7 million due to a higher outstanding debt balance as we proactively increased our liquidity and financial flexibility in light of COVID uncertainty. Second quarter EBITDA increased $16.3 million from a year ago to $161.9 million, and 11% improvement. As Chad mentioned, this is the highest quarterly EBITDA in our history, driven by our cost management measures both at the corporate and local levels, combined with the improving demand through the quarter. The reduction in variable expenses related to compensation, travel and entertainment and fuel costs contributed to an 8.3% EBITDA margin compared to a 7.1% margin in the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $79.2 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared with $71.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase of $5.1 million share was primarily driven by the improved operating results, partially offset by higher adjusted interest expense. On slide six, I would like to highlight the strength of our business, driven this quarter by the focused execution of our team, allowing us to partner with customers to supply critical products and services as demand recovered. Economic slowdowns mainly in the northeast, Northwest, Midwest and Florida significantly impacted demand across our product categories, partially offset by growth in the remainder of our footprint. This was especially true on our manufactured product category, which was disproportionately impacted by the geographies for most by the pandemic. Excluding those impacted regions, our manufactured products sales increased in the quarter. Overall value added for organic sales declined by approximately 3% offset by the contribution of our strategic acquisition. We are committed to continuing the expansion of our network of manufacturing components facility strategically located across the country. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased to have added a state-of-the art manufacturing facility in Spartanburg South Carolina during the quarter, extending our industry leading position to 65 manufacturing facilities. We expect that approximately 25% of our total 2020 capital expenditures will be invested in our value-add growth initiatives and expansion of our production capacity. Our second quarter core organic sales declined by an estimated 4% in the single-family new construction end market compared to a decrease of 13% in overall U.S. single-family starts. Although we performed better than expected in the majority of our market, the growth was limited by the impact of COVID in certain parts of the country. Core organic growth in the R&R and other end market grew 4% as we saw relative strength in the western part of the country and began to lap the unfavorable tariff impact in the upper Midwest in the prior year period. Multifamily core organic declined by 2%, largely due to the timing of some large projects impacted by the shutdown. Turning to our financial flexibility on page eight, a key factor driving our value creation in recent years has been our strong cash generation. During the first half of 2020, we produced free cash flow of approximately $115 million. The aggressive actions we discussed last quarter to preserve cash, including an initial reduction in discretionary CapEx spending and increased vigilance around working capital or key drivers in our year-to-date performance. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow continued to represent more than 90% of adjusted EBITDA. It just had a clear impact on net leverage, which improved by about half a churn versus prior year to 2.3 times representing it to lowest levels since the 2015 ProBuild acquisition. Since our last call, our liquidity improved by an additional $200 million to $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting our positive free cash flow. At the onset of the pandemic in April, our primary objective was to preserve cash. With better clarity around the market, and without ample liquidity, we are resuming our investment in capital priorities, including acquisitions, and growth CapEx primarily focused on value-added growth initiatives. Our deal pipeline remains robust and we are focused on investing for the long term. Turning to our outlet on slide nine, our first half results reflect our experience managing through cycles and the resilience of our business to generate growth. Our first half results also demonstrate a positive overall homebuilding environment, supported by a positive tailwind and rising demand across our diverse national footprint, which continued into July. Based on this backdrop, we are introducing an outlook for the third quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be flat year-over-year at approximately $160 million. We anticipate core organic sales growth to be in the mid-single digit range year-over-year for the third quarter. New housing demand has proven to be resilient in nearly all localities where we operate, which provides the basis for our outlook. Amid all of the macro uncertainties, we are guiding to a balanced growth assumption while positioning our business to take advantage of potential upside opportunities. Keep in mind, our core organic growth outlook reflects our core sales performance and excludes the sales contribution from acquisitions as well as specific commodity inflation in the coming quarters. Over the past few months, we have been managing the rapid commodity inflation incurring in our industry. As I mentioned earlier, we expect our third quarter gross margin percentages to be below our normalized levels due to that inflation. We anticipate our gross margin percentage to be in the low 24% range for the third quarter compared to our normalized levels of over 26% when commodities are at more stable prices. This margin decline is a temporary headwind as we have demonstrated in the past. We will see a quarter or two of margin pressure during the inflationary period along with increasing gross margin dollars. I'll note that we experienced a similar pressure on gross margins in mid-2018 when inflation spiked. As the inflation subsided, we recovered that margin with above normal margins during the deflationary period. Back since the beginning of 2018, through the second quarter of 2020, our gross margins tend to average approximately 26%, which is in line with our normalised level and is consistent with how we manage our business through commodity swing. Since 2018, we have generated nearly $1 billion of operating cash flow, and we fully expect to build upon that cash generation through year end 2020. We continue to expect our cash interest will be in the $110 million to $115 million range for the full year of 2020. With our growth projects underway again, we now expect capital expenditures to be in the $100 million to $110 million range for the full year. Looking beyond 2020, the structural advantages of our business remain intact. We delivered solutions that make our customers more productive and efficient. We have deeper and more integrated relationships with our customers than ever before. We are much more than a supplier of commodity lumber. We are a highly valued partner to many very sophisticated builders, delivering labor savings and just in time delivery of critical building materials, helping them maintain a streamlined supply chain. These higher margin value-added offerings represent the largest portion of our business and the focus of our growth. With our solid financial position, we believe, we are uniquely positioned to accelerate our profitable growth through underlying market expansion, supplemented by targeted acquisitions, and operational excellence initiatives to accomplish our long term objectives and capture underlying market growth. We therefore affirm our previously communicated long range plan targets, which remain on track to be achieved by 2022. We have full confidence in our business to be the supplier of choice for building materials and value added products in the months and years to come. Our strong financial position, coast-to-coast geographically diversified product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities and strong partnerships with customers are unmatched competitive advantages in any market environment. I would especially like to thank our Builders FirstSource team for their dedication to our company, our customers and our communities. Operator, we can now open up the call for Q&A Yes. I'm start off and let Chad finish up. The performance in June, July is obviously not done yet. But looking like it'll be right in that same range maybe a little bit better. We had talked earlier about the potential for an air pocket, wondering what the recovery might look like if there were some pent up demand from the sort of timeframe when everything was pretty much shut down. Things have been not telling you anything you don't already know, surprisingly resilient. And we're very pleased with sort of the overall sustainability of the trend that things have come back. And as you've heard, as we have heard, from many of the builders around the country, there is a tremendous amount of optimism. There's no strength in that homebuilding market. So that's really the rationale that we're giving ourselves for that mid-single digits third quarter growth number in that single family space. It's still, a little bit open, in terms of where it will land could be better. As always, there's enough volatility in COVID land where it could be worse, but we were feeling pretty good about it on balance and the order rates to what we're seeing. And we're certainly pushing ourselves to get better and better about managing price and doing so efficiently as possible quite ready to sign up for faster than our one two quarters. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it for now. But certainly internally, that's our goal for ourself. Yes, absolutely. You heard it right, that the nature of the decline in manufactured products is sort of that, mid-single digit in that organic components. So yes, we did see a decline. The biggest reason for that and we dug into the numbers was around the fact that the other was a higher amount of, on a mixed basis, a higher mix of that manufactured product in the markets where we got hit the hardest. So was unfortunate it's I think, representative of opportunity delays in front of us as those markets were covered. But, an area like, the Northwest, specific northwest of Florida for example, that's a manufactured products business is a great business for us. We've great partnerships. We've sort of proven the value proposition, and it's a higher percent -- a much higher percentage of the mix in those markets. So then when we work hard in those markets, disproportionately, that's why it shows up in that organic number. But still feel very good about the business. It's not a structural issue, it continues to grow. In other parts of the country, it continues to be just as successful or more so in every market where we sell it versus the core and overall business. First of all, exciting. And then I'm looking forward to it, and now it's fundamental structure of what we thought about earlier this year is not changed. We are -- when we go back there \u2013 and I know as you have not talked about this in the past, when we're going through and looking at the variety of models that we pull together to look at this business over time. We certainly have a number of different levers that we can pull, in addition to what I would describe as sort of a core underlying mark. Right. Of course, we're going to be heavily influenced by single family. Of course, we're going to be impacted by a commodity, sort of core to who we are. But we also have the ability to really control our own fate in a lot of ways. Investments that we're making in the core business that's value-add strategy that we've been executing on has been very effective. Now with our being even below our targeted leverage ratio, we have tremendous liquidity and terms of this opportunity to go after what we believe to be a very, very healthy pipe of M&A opportunities. And operational excellence continues to perform. We continue to make progress. We continue to see an operation that knows how to and wants to get better and to have better results each quarter. So, really, while we were -- I think, prudently conservative by pulling the 2020 guidance last quarter as we run our numbers and looked at where we're at and where we can be, what things are sort of coming together for us. We feel very good about 2022. We think that is just the area is absolutely attainable and we have line of sight to how we're going to get there. And as I mentioned, it doesn't -- everything doesn't have to work together perfectly for us to hit that number. We have to continue working and doing what we're good at. Sure. Yes. So, just to recap what we were saying in the script, right, the Northeast, obviously, kind of the upper Midwest, the Michigan area, in particular, the Pacific Northwest and then later on as we got past the initial impact, we also saw slowdown in Florida. Those were all I would say the areas that were highlighted and I think truly saw the biggest impact for us as a company. When it comes to recovery, I would say, in Pacific Northwest has bounce back very quickly. I would say, the Michigan and upper Midwest area has definitely stabilized and started to march back. Northeast is still suffering quite a bit. I mean, there's no way around it. They continue to have very strict controls. I think the population in general has suffered more and has states slower. So that recovery is underway, but certainly not back to normal levels up there yet. In Florida, I think they're still perhaps in the middle of some of the uncertainty, given the exposure to tourism, they've certainly seen a lot of concern, a lot of the declines for their core businesses. And so they are still, again, they're on the road back, but haven't been far to get go. When looking at the relative exposure in those areas for manufactured products, obviously, Florida is important to us. But so it's the Northeast. There are some corridors of real good strength there for us. So it will be a recovery that you'll see and we're confident in that sort of growth over time in the manufactured products. But those couple of markets will be a more of a progression back to normal rather than a quick snap back. But I think it's important to know that, if you can look at the overall value-added products. If you exclude those target regions, we were up low single digit. So the rest of the country is still even with the suppressed starts numbers and some of the concerns still growing as we would expect it to be in overtime. I'm glad you highlight that, Trey. I would say this is really just a testament to the discipline that our teams live and breathe each day. We went out with some messaging, sort of just some reminders and some playbooks to folks. When we saw that sort of a concern in the shutdown setting, just coaching people on how to manage through it, right, and what our team just did a great job resizing the business when it was appropriate, making sure that we were cutting costs, being disciplined. And obviously, some of the things we did to give ourselves a little extra flexibility more broadly as a company we talked about that, delaying wages, salary cuts for executives. Sorry, delaying wage increases and salary cuts for executives. Those were things that we thought were necessary just to give ourselves that flexibility. Clearly we did very, very well as we went through that sort of pause period. Since then, with the recovery that we've seen, we've reinstituted, the merit increases, we restored all those cuts that we made. And the nature of the resizing of the business is very specific to the locations. So we try to retain the staffing, making sure we weren't hurting ourselves strategically. Our ability to compete, our ability to win, we didn't want to undermine that by being too aggressive, because we don't believe that we've allowed ourselves to get fat in these markets. There wasn't a ton of a cut. So what you saw at the end of the day was I think some real flexibility in the core around comm that some of that will come back, obviously in terms of expenses. You saw about a third of our overall benefit being TBD. Now that ones bit more time to play out. The question remains, will it ever get back to normal? Will we ever travel like we used to? TBD, but certainly that we anticipate will come back to some degree over time. Then third, that was really the fuel expense. And obviously, there's been some volatility in the cost of fuel. So that will normalize to wherever it's going to normalize to over time, maybe not right away on that one either. But we didn't go back through this organization and make any real structural changes or massive cuts. Our focus was on making sure we were responding and being ready to move forward. At this point that seems things played out pretty well. Thank you, Trey. Yes. So, when we first brought out that $750 million EBITDA target we were referring to before. We were pretty explicit about putting a $1.1 million single family start number on there. However, earlier this year, we've come back and said, we have enough levers where we think we can get to that number even with just a healthy single family starts environment. It doesn't have to get to that million one number. So way we think about it is really those opportunities to control our own fate will be very, very impactful and perhaps as much as what we anticipate the continued recovery and starts today. So we talked about that, obviously, the M&A opportunities, what we are committed to staying within our stated range. We've got quite a bit of room there, where we have opportunities to grow our value-added with both greenfield and capacity work. Certainly that's a strong growth opportunity for us. And the operational excellence initiatives we've talked about right, whether it would be getting better and more disciplined. The pricing getting better and more effective in our distribution and logistics management, or even just opportunities to reduce costs and become more efficient in the back office. We think there are certainly ways that it can get us to that. We're not 100% dependent on that single family starts. So I guess, I'll give you an example without naming any names, where you are -- our internal model for valuations that we've been using and refining over the years certainly requires us to understand our weighted average cost of capital and make sure that the returns that we're seeing are making sense, but even risk we're taking in one of those deals. And what we're experiencing right now is that we are consistently bringing, seeing deals brought to pass by our regional management teams that look at really nice businesses that we think would be a great fit for us around the country. They're tuck-ins, right? So you may not be very excited about it at the top level, but we're seeing an accumulation of these deals and when we put them through our models and start speaking with the leadership teams of these targets, we thing there's a -- there are great opportunities. The valuations make sense. The return are great. The teams fit together and we think that it will continue to sort of accumulate into competitive advantages. We bring together sort of that model of our product portfolio, the capabilities that we bring with our national footprint, opportunities to introduce value-add or expanded value-add market. That's -- I would say, the accumulation of those factors is where that optimism comes from the list and the way that list is being sort of vetted through our processes as we continue to accelerate our M&A focus. We're ready to go. Sure. Hey, Jay. Most of the $14 million beat in the second quarter, I would say were based on actions that are going to come back over time. I would say maybe further that will come back right away based on things people already done that are attributable to TV will take some time to phase back and unlikely they bounce back in the third quarter. Although I starting to eat away at it as things start to losing up in certain markets. And then, you'll -- I think you could probably estimate that better than I can. And those are the major components. And I'll just add, even just 50 basis points of margin improvement, that's real money. And part of it is, to some degree breaking old habits. I've always sold this with a 24% margins as well. Why can't it be 24.5. What can the market bear? So give them more tools to understand that. And then also knowing, bucketing your customers and knowing which customers are more expensive to serve and making sure you're getting proper margin and a net return on those customers. So a lot of it's just giving them the tools and the information to make those decisions much more quickly. Thank you, Kurt. Yes. I think the -- probably the most direct answer to your question is the velocity of the change in commodities. The nature of those short term fixed price contracts certainly put us through a certain amount of exposure for a window of time. And these are unprecedented increases. You're up 20, 30 points a month. That's a very, very difficult thing to compensate for. So we're just recognizing that in the third quarter. Your point is right on there is some nice leverage that comes when the value of those commodities gets higher. And to the bottom line it's a no question of positive and one that we absolutely expect to flow through our P&L over time, but that's a short answer. I guess, I want to be a little bit thoughtful about how I answer this. There were certain important customers who acted more aggressively and less aggressively during the downturn than others. And the nature of some of those decisions certainly gave us some pause there. Back in this certain markets, they were particularly impacted, at least out of the gate or some of the more tourism impacted markets. All those markets have absolutely come back to the degree. There is a recovery underway. And I don't see that as a long term issue. But I do think there is a bit of a progression back to normal that is required for us to kind of see full help there. But we have a very strong footprint. Very good businesses. Our folks are doing a great job down there. It's certainly not a concern about the operation. It's just a matter of how quickly it ramps back to where we would consider to be strong again. Yes. So year to-date, I think we did just the one -- we had one that open sort of provided year end timelines, so its somewhere one or two. We have a couple more that are being built out. As far as timing and when they will open. So probably one to two more that will fall into this year. Again, kind of that year end timeline. It's a great time to kind of get that work done and get them starting to ramp up, because it's a bit of a slow season for us generally, but we do continue to focus on looking for areas for retail facilities and we expect to continue that going forward. Sure. Yes. So the one thing I'll let you know. I'm sure you already know this. But just for the other listeners that our R&R and other includes kind of the commercial business as well. So I can tell you that we have sort of a tale of two cities there that where core R&R retail and remodel businesses is far stronger, more than doubled at 4% rate. And then the commercial businesses where we see some downturn and that's definitely offset. So we've got that retail footprint. Southern California is a great example, business is doing wonderfully, really performing well, ready and responding to the homeowner needs. And those markets are doing very, very well. As we mentioned in the script, the Midwest market is sort of leveled out. We've seen a bit of a headwind there in past years and it's been healthier. Certainly also seeing that tailwind from the overall trends nationally in the R&R space. Even Alaska's R&R market has done well. But that commercial part of our business where we do have projects. Again, that's got some pretty solid Alaska explorer. That has been part of it, as some of those projects have been either delayed or paused for whatever reason. Good morning, Reuben."

I will now turn the call over to Chad Crow.\nChad Crow: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019d first like to say that our thoughts are with those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We express our gratitude to the first responders, health care workers, and all those on the frontline who have worked tirelessly to help us get through this situation. I am also incredibly proud of how the Builders FirstSource team has responded to take care of each other, our customers and our communities by upholding our core values to protect the well-being of all. For several years leading up to 2020, we have taken significant actions to expand our business, optimize our operations, pay down debt, improve cash flow and more closely partner with our customers through an integrated product offering. While the U.S. economy has transformed in an unprecedented way since our last update in February, our business entered the COVID-19 pandemic at the strongest point in our company\u2019s history. This has allowed us to effectively power through to the initial phases of the pandemic, as demonstrated by our solid first quarter performance, while also taking additional steps to fortify our business for the uncertain period ahead. Last quarter and before the pandemic began to impact the economy, I announced my planned retirement in 2020 at the commencement \u2013 in the commencement of asserts from our replacement. Given the rapidly evolving market landscape along with the economic uncertainty of the coming months, I have notified the Board of my intention to stay until the virus situation stabilizes, and the company has resumed more normal operations. We are all completely focused on emerging from this crisis a stronger company. Before we discuss results, I\u2019ll provide an update on the current market landscape and some actions we have taken. As I mentioned, we entered this pandemic at the strongest point in our company\u2019s history. As an essential business, we continue to supply critical products to customers with a paramount focus on health and safety. We are prioritizing the well-being of our team members, channel partners, and the communities where we operate. Fortunately, we have the ability to do so while maintaining operational continuity. Nearly all of our locations have remained open, except in the few states or counties where construction activities were suspended, but that list of states is shrinking. We have dedicated teams in place to monitor best practices, ensure compliance with shifting local orders, and implement swift action as needed. In addition to the many safety protocols and social distancing measures that we have put in place, our investments in technology are helping us maintain our connections with customers and our overall effectiveness. This includes My BFS Builder where we complement our first-class face-to-face customer service with an innovative customer portal. Customers can quickly access details regarding their account, receive automatic notifications of delivery, download statements and make payments, all with the goal of making it easier for customers to do business with us and for the time being, minimize physical contact. Our business performed well in the first quarter, even during the month of March. We met our financial expectations and finished the quarter strong, and our value-add products were once again a major contributor to our success. Looking ahead, there are several factors I would like to call out for the coming months. During the quarter, many of our customers worked vigorously to complete existing units under construction. As a valued partner to many builders, I am proud that our teams were able to provide customers with the critical products they needed to keep projects moving. However, as the quarter ended and the economic conditions softened in April, home sales declined and new projects coming into the pipeline have not fully replaced completed projects. As a result, we have taken actions to address the softer market conditions in what we expect will be an air pocket in construction activity. Last month, we announced proactive steps to enhance our financial flexibility, liquidity, and cash flow. At the end of March, we had $672 million of total liquidity. Out of an abundance of caution, we recently tapped the debt markets to end the month of April with $1 billion of total liquidity, including $193 million of cash and no significant debt maturities for the next seven years. On the operational side, we are taking a balanced approach to mitigate the impact of reduced demand on our profitability While protecting as many existing jobs as we can, as we believe the worst of the downturn will be short-lived. Recall that in 2019, we added $25 million in EBITDA through an operational excellence initiative to optimize process and control costs in a growing market. In response to COVID-19, we are enhancing our efforts to include: resizing locations where needed; minimizing discretionary capital expenditures; optimizing working capital; limiting and delaying operating expenses; tightly managing corporate spend; and reducing Board and senior management pay. These actions, while difficult, are helping to preserve cash and profitability while maintaining our ability to efficiently respond as demand recovers. We will continue to take prudent actions to maintain a strong liquidity position and operate our business with a safety-first emphasis across our nationwide footprint. While the extent and duration of the current economic crisis remains unclear, we are well prepared to navigate through it and keep our company positioned to succeed as the economy begins to improve. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our first quarter results and balance sheet in more detail.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s work in delivering another quarter of strong results and supporting our customers during this dynamic time. I will streamline our first quarter review, given it is in the rearview mirror at this point. I will also highlight the structural elements that we see as important near-term considerations to help communicate our confidence in the business. We had $1.8 billion in net sales in the first quarter with core organic growth of 3.9%. You heard me use a new term right there, as we are introducing a new core organic growth metric this quarter. We believe it is an efficient way to discuss the underlying performance of our business by excluding acquisitions, commodity impacts, and differences in selling days from net sales. Net sales in total increased 9.5%. Core organic growth as I mentioned was 3.9%. Our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added 3.5% and one additional selling day contributed 1.7%. Commodity price inflation was minimal and added 0.4% to net sales. Our value added product categories again led the way on a per day and core organic basis reflecting the continued execution of our strategic plan and the emphasis of those businesses on those key products. Our gross margin percentage was 26% and in line with our expectations for the quarter. The 110 basis points decline compared to the prior year period was a result of the previously communicated normalization in our lumber and lumber sheet goods product margin. Last year, we experienced a strong tailwind due to commodity deflation, which did not recur in 2020. Amid all of the expected noise related to COVID, please continue to keep in mind the mechanics of our margins as we have discussed on prior calls. Commodity cost deflation causes short-term gross margin percentage expansion when price has dropped rapidly relative to our short-term price and commitments that we provide customers. We experienced this benefit during the first quarter of 2019, and this benefit did not recur in the first quarter of 2020. Commodity costs increased markedly in February of 2020 before retreating to prior levels in the face of COVID-related interruptions. At this point, we expect we will see a modest impact from commodity inflation in our Q2 results. Interest expense increased by $27 million to $51.9 million compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of one-time items related to debt extinguishments, interest expense was down by $1 million on a lower outstanding debt balance year-over-year. First quarter EBITDA decreased $3.9 million to $97 million representing the higher end of our expectations. The year-over-year decline was largely driven by the previously discussed normalization in our gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2020. On Slide 4, you can see that the strength of our business driven by our national scale and strong local customer relationships was again evident as our customers push to complete units under construction. Higher margin value-added products remained at 42% of total sales in the quarter with estimated volume growth of 9% in combined manufacturing \u2013 manufactured products and windows, doors, and millwork product categories. On Slide 5, our first quarter organic growth with an estimated 3% in the single family new construction end market with broad-based growth across the country. A common thread is that we grew value-added products in the single family market in all of our regions. Core organic growth in R&R and other end other was 2% on broad growth as well. Multifamily core organic improved by 19% largely due to the timing of projects started earlier in 2019 when we implemented organizational improvements. Turning to our front-end liquidity and de-risk balance sheet on Page 6, let me first address cash flow. During the quarter, we had an outflow of free cash of approximately $79 million. The first quarter is seasonally our low point for cash flow as we typically use cash in the first half of the year and build up cash in the second half. This year is clearly shaping up to be unprecedented in nature and as Chad discussed, we have taken aggressive action to preserve cash including a significant reduction in CapEx spending and an increased vigilance around working capital. Looking at our net leverage, we ended the quarter down 0.2 times compared to prior year and up 0.3 times from December 31st. The sequential increase is partly due to the funding of prior acquisitions, which are not yet fully reflected in EBITDA, as well as the normal seasonal buildup and working capital. On a pro forma basis, our net leverage was closer to the low end of our two and a half to three and a half times targeted range. With that backdrop, let\u2019s focus on the structure of our capital resources for the current environment. We have already discussed our spending in cash preservation measures, so I\u2019ll address the recent debt financing transactions that are provided, significant additional liquidity in recent months. Since the beginning of the year, we have made several moves to push out maturities and improve our access to cash. First in February, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes that mature 10 years from now in 2030. We use the proceeds to pay off $504 million of existing debt that matured in 2024, plus a portion of our 2027 notes. This transaction was opportunistic in nature and unfortunate timing ahead of COVID\u2019s impact on the economy. In April, 2020, in response to the pandemic, we raised an additional $350 million in 2027 senior notes. We use those proceeds to repay the funds drawn under our revolving credit facility and left the remainder in cash. Following these transactions, we have approximately $1 million \u2013 $1 billion of total liquidity, including $193 million of cash representing a greater than 50% increase in liquidity since the end of the first quarter. We have a term loan in the amount of $52 million due in 2024, but beyond that, we have no maturities until 2027 and a weighted average maturity schedule of eight years. That represents an almost three-year extension in our weighted average maturity schedule since the beginning of the year. Including our recent bond offering, we expect our cash interest to be in the $100 to $110 million range for the full year of 2020. We believe our balance sheet is appropriately structured to face the challenges ahead. We have no covenants worth discussing and we have over $800 million available to us on our revolver. We are prepared to draw down additional capital is needed, but do not see a reason to do so at this time based on our free cash flow expectations. In terms of capital allocation, our primary objective at this time is to preserve cash. We have put numerous investment plans on hold including acquisitions and growth CapEx. If you recall, we had originally anticipated to invest around one-third of our total 2020 capital expenditures in value-add growth initiatives. While some of those \u2013 some of that has already been spent with the deferral of growth projects, we now expect capital expenditures to be in the $75 to $85 million range for the full year. In summary, we ended the quarter with a strong capital position, have further fortified our balance sheet and have ample coverage to effectively navigate the developing economic environment. I will now turn the call back to Chad for his closing comments.\nChad Crow: Thank you, Peter. We have managed through prior downturns, and our business is much stronger today than it was a decade ago. Our national scale vast product portfolio and our local market density across 77 of the top 100 MSAs are just a few of the reasons. Today, high-margin value added products, which make our customers more productive and efficient, are the largest portion of our business. Our net leverage is at the low end of our long-term target and we have a much deeper and more integrated relationship with our customers than ever before. We are much more than a supplier of lumber. We are a highly valued partner to many very sophisticated builders delivering labor savings and just-in-time delivery of critical building materials, helping them maintain a streamlined supply chain. As I\u2019ve mentioned several times today, we are better prepared than at any point in our history to address the rapidly evolving and unprecedented economic environment. In early April, we withdrew our full year guidance due to the uncertainty in the current homebuilding market. Our prior outlook did not contemplate the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, in regards to our previous week communicated long-range plan, despite our confidence in long-term financial goals, we are also putting our targeted 2022 timing under review until we have a better view of the economic impact of COVID. The uncertainty regarding the duration of the COBIT crisis, the pace of recovery and the lingering impacts on the economy remain unclear. As I mentioned earlier, the hurried pace by customers to complete projects during March tapered off as we move through April. This resulted in a high single-digit percent decline in core organic net sales for the month of April compared to the prior year period. We believe this was due to a combination of factors including some builders shutting down certain other construction sites due to strict shelter in place, orders conflicting local mandate and for obvious health reasons. Our teams have also noted understaffing at some critical government offices delaying, permitting and production schedules. At construction sites that are operational, the logistics have become more complex to accommodate precautions to limit the spread of the virus. And as many public builders have reported the pace of new home orders has weakened in recent months due to social distancing guidelines, stay at home recommendations and general economic uncertainty, deferring some near-term home buying activity. We believe these factors make it likely that the market environment will weaken further in the coming months at the backlog of projects that started prior to the pandemic are completed and before new starts begin to ramp up again. That said, we still believe there will be a significant base level of demand for our essential products and services. We are encouraged by the reported uptake and uptick in new home sales in the past two weeks and have seen similar trends in orders coming into our trust and panel plants. From an operational and financial perspective, we are well positioned for a challenging second order, and we\u2019ll continue to adjust our business as needed. Given the limited visibility on a length and severity of the economic impact, we have a range of internal forecast depending on many sets of future assumptions. While we are not publicly disclosing our scenario analysis based on our cost position, our capital structure, our operational excellence initiatives, and a lot of contingency planning, we believe that our business will be able to produce positive free cash flow for the remainder of the full year 2020. We remain ready to make operational adjustments and react quickly. We will continue to align our costs with the evolving demand environment and will work to preserve our strong liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. We have full confidence in our business to be the supplier of choice for building materials and value-added products in the months and years to come. Our enhanced geographic reach, diversified product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities, and strong partnerships with customers are unmatched, competitive advantage \u2013competitive advantages in any market environment. I would especially like to thank the Builders FirstSource team for their unwavering dedication to our company, customers and communities during this volatile time and into the recovery. Operator, we can now open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll now take a question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and hope everyone\u2019s doing well. I wanted to ask a sort of a bigger-picture question on the value-added products and prefab components, particularly in this environment. Are you guys thinking that sort of where construction labor could potentially become more available for several reasons here over these next several months. Do you think prefab can continue to take share? I know it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about this before, but it varies by market where it\u2019s been more or less adopted. What have you seen so far in those categories and how are you thinking about the dynamic whether prefab can continue to take share? Thank you.\nChad Crow: Personally, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s going to reverse. It\u2019s been taking share. I think it will continue to take share. I think builders see the value in it. They see the efficiency it creates on their job sites. It requires \u2013 it can require less people and less time on the job sites. I guess there could be a few instances where builders could revert back. But in general, I don\u2019t see that trend reversing.\nPeter Jackson: I agree. We grew through the last cycle in value add. I think that there was \u2013 there\u2019s an argument to be made, there was a far more labor availability during the last cycle than there is or will be during this one. So I think there\u2019s every reason for confidence. This is a product that the homebuilders like and use and rely on.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about \u2013 the comment you just made, Chad around sort of pushing out that the timing of thinking about some of your operational excellence, understandably so, but I guess my question is, what can you actually continue in this environment in terms of those operational excellence initiatives? What are you taking a pause on? I kind of just want to hear the big-picture thoughts, but then also what that could mean for cost savings in 2020? Thank you.\nChad Crow: Yes. Maybe I wasn\u2019t clear. Right now, we have no intention to pausing on operational excellence initiatives. The pausing is more on some of the growth initiatives and M&A activity. But right now, we\u2019re full speed ahead on our operational excellence initiatives.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay, perfect. Thanks for clarifying that. Appreciated. Thanks guys.\nChad Crow: You bet.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Trey Morrish with Evercore ISI.\nTrey Morrish: Thanks very much guys. Chad, it\u2019s nice to hear that you\u2019re going to be sticking around for a little bit given all the sudden uncertainty, so we could talk a little bit more. But you are also around last cycle as well during the downswing. How much of what you\u2019re doing today is related to the playbook that you\u2019ve all pulled out last cycle? And just how do you view the current challenging environment compared to the financial crisis downswing?\nChad Crow: Yes, that\u2019s a great question. First of all, it wasn\u2019t just me that it was around. I bet, gosh, 75% of our team has probably been around, and that includes the guys out in the field. And one thing they are very good about is adjusting their operations for demand to changes in demand. That\u2019s not just in situations like this, but from a seasonal perspective across a given year, especially in the upper \u2013 the Northern markets where seasonality is a huge factor. That\u2019s just a way of life for them. And so, the good news is we have an experienced team that knows how to deal with it. Right now, we have the playbook ready. And to be honest, we haven\u2019t initiated all those plays yet because we haven\u2019t needed to. Our sales have held up remarkably well. Now in states where we were required to close for a period of time, we did some temporary layoffs and things like that and adjusted our cost structure, but as we\u2019ve opened back up, we\u2019ve been able to bring most of those folks back. Now that being said, we do anticipate a slowdown in the coming months, and we will be prepared to adjust our cost structure accordingly. I don\u2019t have the crystal ball of what this is going to look like. Personally, I think it\u2019s not going to be anything like the last crisis. I think it\u2019s going to be much shorter lived than that. I think the underpinnings are much different right now. We\u2019re not in an overbuilt position like we were 10 years ago. In fact, you could argue we were still in an underbuilt position now. Now, there will be some bumps along the way. There\u2019s a high level of unemployment that we\u2019ll have to work through, but there\u2019s still a lot of positive things that give me hope that this is going to be relatively short-lived. I think the pandemic could drive some people out of big cities and wanting some space of their own. That could drive some additional homebuilding. Mortgage rates are still low. So, there\u2019s the demographics. There\u2019s a lot of things that give me hope that this will be relatively short-lived and nothing like 10 years ago. If it gets as bad as 10 years ago, we\u2019ve got a boatload of liquidity, and we\u2019ll be ready to react. So right now, I, look, we\u2019ve got an experienced team, we\u2019ve got a balance sheet that\u2019s got $1 billion of liquidity, and we will manage through whatever the current economic environment presents to us. But when you compare what I see coming in the next few months and few quarters to what we went through in 2008, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything like that. Will there be a couple of rough quarters? Yes, I think there will be, but \u2013 and we\u2019ll be able \u2013 we\u2019ll be ready to pull the playbook out again. But right now, as I said, we\u2019ve been very fortunate being deemed as an essential business, and our business has held up remarkably well thus far.\nTrey Morrish: Okay, thanks for that. And then you talked about April being down high single digits in your core organic growth. I\u2019m just wondering if you could kind of talk about that, at least qualitatively. Any difference in that you\u2019re seeing value-add, I guess, with different customer types whether it\u2019s public or private builders acting differently? Whether they got for on the spectrum and versus build-to-order or acting differently, any type of color you can you can provide there?\nChad Crow: It\u2019s more regional based. As you would expect, up in the Northeast, they\u2019ve been hit the hardest. They\u2019re probably down more than any other region. The opposite of that is, gosh, down around Georgia and Florida, you wouldn\u2019t know there was anything going on. Our results so far are on plan and up first prior year. And so those are the two bookings that we\u2019re seeing and all the other reasons are kind of fallen in between that. So, we haven\u2019t really seen a difference by builder type. It\u2019s really more a geographical difference and, how much the pandemic is really shut down operations in those regions.\nTrey Morrish: Okay. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from John Baugh with Stifel.\nJohn Baugh: Thank you. Welcome back, Chad. It\u2019s like you never left.\nChad Crow: Yes, it\u2019s great.\nJohn Baugh: I was wondering sort building on the last question a little bit. If it\u2019s a way, obviously in States where construction is closed, I would assume the results are materially weaker and then they might actually rebound a little from where they\u2019ve been in the last few weeks. Do I have that right first? And then secondly, in those areas where you\u2019ve remained open, you sort of mentioned that the pipeline is filling on the front end. I was curious as to whether you felt that was sort of cancellations or deferrals, if you have any sort of read through on those \u2013 on that. Thank you.\nChad Crow: Well, I think your assumption is correct. In states where we were closed, there is a little bit of pent-up demand there as we reopened. We see a little bit of a surge, but we still think the worst is yet to come in the next couple of months. That\u2019s a tough question on, whether it\u2019s deferrals or cancellations. Honestly I think it\u2019s got to be some of both. You\u2019ve got 30 million people that are filing for unemployment now. How many of those were potential homeowners in the near-term? I don\u2019t know. But I can say in the southeast, where our results are still pretty strong. We\u2019re seeing the still a pretty solid pipeline of new starts and new construction. But I think time will tell. I wish I had the answer, but I think time will tell on whether these are deferrals or cancellations. But my guess is it\u2019s going to be some of both.\nJohn Baugh: And then obviously you\u2019re not going to do M&A now. I fully understand. But curious as to how you think the competitive landscape is positioned going into this downturn. Whether there might be even more opportunities and if correct, where you\u2019d sort of pull the trigger? What would it take timing-wise or what you\u2019re seeing to sort of change your stance?\nChad Crow: Yes, I do think this will create opportunities that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been there. What those will look like. I don\u2019t know. But clearly, as we\u2019ve discussed, we took out a lot of incremental debt. Liquidity \u2013 in uncertain times, liquidity is king. In uncertain times, liquidity is a lot like a concealed weapon. I\u2019d rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. So consider us armed and daters once this thing levels out and there\u2019s acquisition opportunities out there because personally, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to need that incremental liquidity, but I\u2019ve learned is coming through the last downturn, it\u2019s better to have it. And so if things turn out like, I think they will, we will have ample liquidity to be able to take advantage of some these situations that will come out.\nJohn Baugh: Okay. Thank you and good luck.\nChad Crow: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC.\nChris Carril: Hi, this is Chris on for Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is just on unlocked pricing. Is there any way you could help us flush out the timing of when you\u2019re going to start seeing the impact of the lower prices on results? Just given your \u2013 if you could just give us an update on your inventory and net you have going forward in the \u2013 in light of the lower-demand backdrop?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yes. I mean the nature of our commodities is pretty consistent. We saw that run-up in pricing, sort of the middle of the first quarter, generally takes about one quarter to two quarters but that will flush through the P&L in terms of the impact on gross margins, resetting pricing. Now in this case, because it went up and then came back down again, it has the potential to be a little quicker, but you still got to work through that inventory. As far as inventory levels, our days of inventory is less than it was a year ago. We\u2019ve been very disciplined about the amount of inventory we brought on to make sure that we didn\u2019t get cost behind any material changes in demand. But that said, we\u2019re still the distributor. So we have inventory on the ground. We will continue to have inventory on the ground. But I think that our performance to date has been sort of continuing the progress that we made last year in keeping that we made last year in keeping our days well managed. I think that the overall lumber and commodity pricing, both OSB and lumber ran up a bit, but it settled back down. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s much room for it to go much lower. I would say that manufacturers have done a good job of taking capacity offline to manage. So, it\u2019s really a matter of seeing when things start to ramp back up again from a homebuilding and demand perspective as to when, if at all, the prices move.\nChris Carril: Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then just for my second question, I was hoping you can drill a little deeper into the trends you saw in April, specifically by product category. Is there any way you could you could break out, I mean, how the value-added parts of your business performed relative to the company average?\nPeter Jackson: So, we definitely don\u2019t want to go down into the weaves on April. I think that the overall trends have been largely consistent what you expect from us. It\u2019s a lot of question mark about where that goes into the future as things start to transition to digest this air pocket or whatever it is we\u2019re going to call it of the shelter in place. We\u2019re already starting to see the improvement in starts \u2013 sorry, in orders through our customers. But really, we\u2019re going to have to watch our homebuilder communication, permits and starts, the normal characteristics that you\u2019d expect us to monitor from our homebuilding customers to know when we\u2019ll expect the things to turn around. But like Chad said, there\u2019ll be a window here where it\u2019s going to get harder.\nChris Carril: Got it. Appreciate the color. Stay safe.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks. You too.\nChad Crow: Thank you. You too.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. I have two questions. One, once homebuilder orders start to bottom and tick up in the right direction, how long will it take for us to see that in your sales, where your inventories are right now?\nChad Crow: Yes. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a hard and fast answer to that, Keith. I think that it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s really dependent on the customer, in the region, a couple of weeks or a couple of months. It could be a range like that. But I think one of the interesting aspects of this and we look at, at least the recent past, there is a little bit of a buffering that happens as homebuilders continue to build through a little bit of their backlog. You have sort of this ability to expand and contract the under construction. I think we\u2019ve seen a little bit of that. We\u2019ve already started to see some of the green shoots or initial indications that we bounced off the bottom on orders. It\u2019s a question of how long it lasts. And does it continue that trajectory? Are there multiple dips? And when it gets a little bit back to normal, what does that normal look like.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Second question, lumber prices. It sequentially fell off pretty hard once this whole mess started. Typically, you tend to get, for a period of time, a little bit of extra margin from that. Is that going to be the case in the second quarter? Or will this just get competed away because the environment is so difficult?\nPeter Jackson: Given how fast it went up and back down again, I expect it\u2019s probably the latter this time.\nKeith Hughes: Okay.\nPeter Jackson: Because it was a month or two.\nKeith Hughes: Yes.\nChad Crow: And I\u2019ll just add, as we expect to see business slow in the quarter, there may be opportunities where we get a little more aggressive on price to just keep the volume coming through our facilities and keep our folks working. So that could offset some of the \u2013 any advantage we would have gotten from the fluctuation in commodity prices this time around.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.\nKurt Yinger: Yes. Good morning, everyone and thanks for all the details. I just wanted to start on gross margin and maybe trying to think about the variability there kind of associated with volume declines and maybe trying to create some goalposts on how you might think about the downside there. And then just on decremental EBITDA margins, I think you guys typically target a low double-digit range. Do you think that\u2019s still a reasonable benchmark? Or is there anything we should be thinking about that might kind of change that in the current environment?\nPeter Jackson: Hey, Kurt. Yes. You\u2019re right on, that\u2019s a great question. I don\u2019t know that I have a lot of particularly useful detail other than we maybe recap a couple of things that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. Yes. We will expect to see deleveraging, to a small degree, in gross margin as demand declines. The extent of the demand will correlate to the size of the impact on margins. We certainly see the variability in SG&A as a rule of thumb being around 70% variable. The tricky part in this particular situation is that we know it\u2019s temporary. The downturn in volume is temporary. So, we may keep a few more folks around to make sure that we\u2019re ready to go on the back end. There are some critical roles in this business that are extremely hard to recruit and retain and you don\u2019t want to let them slip away because you have a 30 or a 60-day window in which you lost some volume. So that\u2019s a good question mark for us to see how bad it goes down and how much do we want to protect versus how much do we just get down the business and rescale the business as appropriate. That fall through is a good question overall for the year. Do I think it\u2019s likely to be in that range? Sure. I don\u2019t think that net directionally is wrong. But for a window of time, could it be better or worse? Yes. No, it could be.\nKurt Yinger: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. You touched on something that kind of leads into my next question. It\u2019s really around how do you balance taking more kind of permanent actions from a facility or even headcount perspective relative to the potential for a short-lived downturn. I mean, is there a certain timeframe where you kind of defer maybe some of these decisions, but at which point, you say, \u201cAll right, we got to start kind of protecting the margin and the profitability of the business. Is there any kind of way to think about when that might be?\nChad Crow: Well, that\u2019s also a great question and probably, the things we\u2019re struggling with the most right now. As I said earlier, thus far, we\u2019ve been very fortunate in our business has held up really well. We expect to see that decline. We also still currently expect it to be a relatively short-lived. When I say, relatively short-lived, months, not years, decline. And so as long as we believe that, I am certainly willing to keep investing in, as Peter said, our key employees. Many, many folks. We\u2019ve got a lot of talented team members and to let some of them go just to ride out a fairly brief downturn in our business would be \u2013 would not be the right thing to do. We want to keep these people employed, and we want to be ready for things to \u2013 when things do recover. And so that\u2019s the tough question. Every day, we learn a little more. And as we continue over the next few weeks and months, if it becomes clear that our assumptions may be off and this may be a little longer downturn, then we\u2019ll adjust accordingly. But right now, we\u2019re working under the assumption that\u2019s going to be relatively short-lived. And so there will be \u2013 anytime our business flows, there\u2019s a reduction in overtime, there\u2019s a reduction in temp labor, there\u2019s a reduction in hours worked. But as far as permanently letting people go, we want to defer that as long as we can and keep buying time in order to get some more clarity on what this thing is going to look like.\nKurt Yinger: All right. Okay, yes. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. And then just lastly, on the competitive front, how do you think about \u2013 or are you seeing any potential benefits kind of in a more challenging backdrop associated with your relative scale and liquidity compared to some of your smaller competitors? And is that something that might benefit more on the customer side from an order perspective or maybe how suppliers approach, who is retaining your product? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: So, I think that the real obvious one, I guess, with $1 billion in liquidity, there is a clear understanding in the marketplace that we are not going anywhere and you can count on us. I think that is a desirable position to be in when you\u2019re talking with customers about how to make sure you\u2019re supporting them and working with them. It\u2019s always a dynamic environment when you\u2019re trying to react. And again, it kind of reiterated an earlier point, and some parts of the countries that are killing it that are doing great. And other parts of the country that are really suffering and happen to hunker down a big way because their customers are. Being able to partner in every one of those situations continuing to invest in our business from an operational excellence perspective, continuing to invest in the portal, continuing to be able to offer services that others can\u2019t, we think that \u2013 it\u2019s that continuity. It\u2019s that reliability and that strength that in this moment and over time, continues to give us a competitive advantage. Will it \u2013 I think the area where it may offer better opportunities are those that having come through this cycle as owners of their own smaller business decide maybe this isn\u2019t such a horrible time to pass the reins. And boy, Builders FirstSource seems like a good group to work with. Maybe we\u2019ll sell to them. So there are opportunities. It\u2019s a little too early to say because we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s really going to look like. At this point, it hasn\u2019t looked like much.\nKurt Yinger: All right. Great, appreciate that color and good luck in the coming quarters.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Kurt. Take care.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsey: Good morning. I guess I wanted to start with the Southeast. Is that the only region of strength, albeit a big region? I guess also with that, what was the percentage of sales coming from the Southeast maybe in 2019? And then thinking about the strength of it, is it on all fronts, both current activity and new orders?\nChad Crow: No. It\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s the strongest region of the country right now for us. But there\u2019s other markets that you can see they\u2019ve been impacted, but they haven\u2019t been near \u2013 as impacted nearly as much as you might have thought they would have been. And yes, the strength we\u2019re seeing in the Southeast is a combination of both existing orders and new orders. I don\u2019t have the percentage of sales breakout with me now, but that\u2019s probably something that maybe you could discuss with Binit later, but it\u2019s not the only region. I was just pointing out the kind of the book ends of the strongest and the most impacted when I made that comment earlier.\nSteven Ramsey: Great. And then on customer speeding up work in March, can you maybe explain how this played out? And do you see \u2013 is that what\u2019s driving some of \u2013 is that continuing into April or is that \u2013 does that taper off in Q1?\nChad Crow: Well, when we were talking about the customers, they\u2019re basically finishing homes that had already been started. So units under construction. They were really making sure they got those homes completed. But we did see many builders start to tap the brakes on spec homes, on new lot development and of course, traffic and new buyer activity slowed given the restraints created by the pandemic. So yes, we mentioned the April results and how they trailed off. Still all in all, a pretty strong April, in my opinion, given what\u2019s going on. But as I mentioned earlier, we are still concerned that there\u2019s kind of an air pocket of demand coming that we\u2019ll have to work through in the coming months.\nSteven Ramsey: Right. And then last question, you talked about the geographical differences being kind of the biggest diverging trend. But maybe can you talk to the difference in health of smaller builders versus large builders? And is cash collection challenged in one or both groups right now?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I think Chad alluded to it a little bit, the difference between the large and small is less pronounced than the difference between hard-hit regions and those regions not seeing nearly the impact. It\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s substantial. It\u2019s kind of hard to overstate how different those two regional indicators are. Now, as far as the cash flow and the collections, as you can imagine, we have been paying particularly close attention to that. The good news is our days are better this year than they were last year. So we have not seen a decay in our performance today. We are certainly being thoughtful about it and being conservative and staying close to our customers whenever there are any delays or indicators of stress that we are staying close. But I think at this point, based on the relatively modest decline in what has happened so far in terms of sales, we certainly have not seen any issues there.\nSteven Ramsey: Great. Thank you for the color.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nChad Crow: Good morning, Jay.\nJay McCanless: So Chad, I just want to go back to what you were talking about in terms of being willing to push price if you need to keep volume up whenever this air pocket is. Are you seeing some of your competitors already making that decision and being more aggressive on price?\nChad Crow: No, I really haven\u2019t seen that yet. It\u2019s just something we would anticipate seeing if we see a significant drop-off in demand.\nJay McCanless: And then I was wondering if you all could quantify the high single-digit decline in April. How much of that is related to whether it\u2019s percentage points, or something along those lines, how much of it is related to areas where you still can\u2019t ship product, whether it\u2019s Michigan or the Northeast, something like that?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I don\u2019t know if we have an exact estimate. It\u2019s a substantial \u2013 they\u2019re \u2013 I don\u2019t like in the same drum again. There\u2019s a massive difference between those regions, right? Pacific Northwest, where they shut down Washington; the Northeast, where they\u2019ve been most deeply impacted, Michigan, as you described. Those numbers are materially different than what you\u2019re seeing in the rest of the country. So, I think it\u2019s fair to say, yes.\nChad Crow: I think we can safely say it\u2019s around half of that number.\nJay McCanless: Great color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nChad Crow: Thanks, Jay.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank.\nSeldon Clarke: Hey, thank you for questions. So, I heard there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces here in the more medium-term far from the situation is still a little bit unclear. But you sound as fairly optimistic about the resiliency and more of a short-term impact to housing than anything else. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what gives you so much confidence here just given where unemployment is trending? Maybe just a little bit more color on where you actually think starts could seek out under various scenarios. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of in between with where we were before this was pandemic and where we were in the financial crisis. So just any color on where you think starts might take out would be helpful.\nChad Crow: I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m ready to give a starts number yet. But look, as I said earlier, this crisis just looks a lot different than what we went through last time. I won\u2019t rehash those. But I do think there\u2019s going to be incremental demand created down the road. And you\u2019ve seen some articles on it recently of renters fleeing apartments and deciding now is the time to get a bit of space of our own if \u2013 I know for our company, in particular, I\u2019m shocked at how well this whole telecommuting thing is working. And thankfully, we have ways in place to monitor what folks are doing at home and metrics and very, very pleased with the productivity that we\u2019ve seen with folks. And so if this whole telecommuting thing sticks, that\u2019s probably going to create a group of people that say, \u201cYou know what, I don\u2019t have to live near downtown anymore where it\u2019s more expensive. If I\u2019m working from home, maybe we go out to the suburbs, where it\u2019s cheaper and we have a little space of our own. So, I think that could provide a boost down the road. And we just don\u2019t have the excess inventory in homes that we had a decade ago. Now to your point, there\u2019s a lot of unemployed people right now, and we\u2019ve got to get folks back to work. And the longer we don\u2019t go back to work, that obviously, the more of this thing is going to drag out. But I just think there\u2019s a lot of still underlying strength that if we can get folks back to work that we\u2019re going to be able to flush through this. And again, I\u2019m not talking weeks and work everything\u2019s back to normal. It very well could be \u2013 it\u2019s likely going to be months. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not going to be four or five years like we saw with the last financial crisis. That\u2019s my opinion anyway.\nSeldon Clarke: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess just under different scenarios and given your kind of willingness to sort of ride this out in the short term, like how do you think about decremental margins over the next couple of quarters versus how they might shape out if this is a little bit of a longer-term weakness \u2013 where weakness persists for a little bit longer than you would expect.\nPeter Jackson: We certainly don\u2019t want to imply guidance on the margins. I think that when we\u2019ve talked about incrementals and decrementals in the past as sort of the curvature has alluded to. We\u2019re talking low double digits, so 12% to 15% is sort of a rule of thumb. And to reiterate, I guess, a little bit about the comment about the \u2013 if we hold on \u2013 if the worst-case scenario happens and we hold on to people a little longer than we should, then it does turn out to be down more. Of course, that\u2019s going to make that a little bit worse on the downside. But it would recover over time because we\u2019ll see that stabilized at a lower level. We\u2019ll take the appropriate actions to reset margins and cost levels to where they need to be.\nSeldon Clarke: Okay, got it. Appreciate the time.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Reuben Garner with Benchmark.\nReuben Garner: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nPeter Jackson: Good morning, Reuben.\nReuben Garner: So, I know R&R is not a huge part of your business, but \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, I got kicked out of the call briefly. But have you seen any uptick in R&R activity or any trends to call out in that part of your business?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Definitely, some green shoots are good news. Not all good because there are some offsetting headwinds. So, the short answer is some of our more retail-focused businesses have seen a nice little uptick. As you know, we own the 50 Line San Lorenzo brands in California. They\u2019re doing quite well in the retail. Some other parts of the country doing well also. Unfortunately, there\u2019s \u2013 we also have our brand \u2013 our retail brand up in Alaska, and the Alaska market has really been hit hard. They\u2019ve gotten a double whammy of oil as well as COVID. So, they\u2019re certainly being hurt by all this. So, I think we\u2019re doing well in that space, a couple of weaker pockets geographically, but certainly happy with our performance there overall.\nReuben Garner: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then second one for me. I know working capital was brought up. The normal rule of thumb, I think, is 9% to 10% of every incremental or detrimental dollar of revenue. Is there anything about the current environment that would mix that drastically different over the next, I don\u2019t know, the duration of 2020? Thanks guys, and good luck navigating through this.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nChad Crow: Yes. No real difference. Based on our recent performance, we might come in a little towards the lower end of the 9% to 10%. But I think things have been fairly consistent. Thanks, Reuben.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.\nRyan Gilbert: Hey, thanks, guys.\nChad Crow: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan Gilbert: The first question from me is it\u2019s a little backward-looking, but the 3% core organic growth in single-family in the first quarter, a little slower than what we were seeing in large single family starts. Is that \u2013 do you think that\u2019s impacted by COVID? Or did you lose some share as competitors got \u2013 or to the extent that competitor has got more aggressive in the market in the first quarter? Has that trended? Or has that trend continued in April so far?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. As you can imagine, that caught our attention. We pay pretty close attention to the single-family numbers. The tricky part, and we talked a little bit about it at the end of last quarter is that we had a really strong end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. I think it\u2019s fair to say we took a boat load of share and so you\u2019re looking at some tough comps. I would also argue the numbers are a little bit odd. I personally have a hard time believing that there isn\u2019t some mathematical anomaly in that February starts number. It just doesn\u2019t ring true to what the market is doing. I think that if you smooth that out a little bit, for us, if you look at it over the last year, we netted a tremendous amount of share. Is there a little bit of pushback from our competitors and people trying to take some of that share back? Sure, yes, no doubt. But I think that we feel good about our share position about having net taken share. And I think we felt really good coming into the year. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 I know we blew by Q1, but it\u2019s a little tough to swallow just how well we were doing in Q1 and how the momentum of the business and the demand was building only to sort of be snuffed out by the COVID dynamics, and now we\u2019re just going to \u2013 we\u2019ll navigate through this bit, but I think we\u2019re starting from a position of strength.\nRyan Gilbert: Yes, totally understand. And can you comment on just pricing and then margins for structural components through late March and April?\nPeter Jackson: We generally don\u2019t get into the granularity of the individual product categories. I would say, on a year-over-year basis, we certainly had some tailwind within those manufactured products, but the component of it that has a good aspect of it in 2019. So, on a year-over-year basis, it would have trended a little. But I think it\u2019s a very healthy part of our business. Margins have been strong and we\u2019re continuing to stay disciplined on pricing and particularly in that category where we think we bring a lot of value to the table.\nRyan Gilbert: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.\nChad Crow: Well, thank you, once again for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our second quarter results. And if you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Binit or Peter. Thank you.\nOperator: And once again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chad Crow",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'd first like to say that our thoughts are with those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We express our gratitude to the first responders, health care workers, and all those on the frontline who have worked tirelessly to help us get through this situation. I am also incredibly proud of how the Builders FirstSource team has responded to take care of each other, our customers and our communities by upholding our core values to protect the well-being of all. For several years leading up to 2020, we have taken significant actions to expand our business, optimize our operations, pay down debt, improve cash flow and more closely partner with our customers through an integrated product offering. While the U.S. economy has transformed in an unprecedented way since our last update in February, our business entered the COVID-19 pandemic at the strongest point in our company's history. This has allowed us to effectively power through to the initial phases of the pandemic, as demonstrated by our solid first quarter performance, while also taking additional steps to fortify our business for the uncertain period ahead. Last quarter and before the pandemic began to impact the economy, I announced my planned retirement in 2020 at the commencement \u2013 in the commencement of asserts from our replacement. Given the rapidly evolving market landscape along with the economic uncertainty of the coming months, I have notified the Board of my intention to stay until the virus situation stabilizes, and the company has resumed more normal operations. We are all completely focused on emerging from this crisis a stronger company. Before we discuss results, I'll provide an update on the current market landscape and some actions we have taken. As I mentioned, we entered this pandemic at the strongest point in our company's history. As an essential business, we continue to supply critical products to customers with a paramount focus on health and safety. We are prioritizing the well-being of our team members, channel partners, and the communities where we operate. Fortunately, we have the ability to do so while maintaining operational continuity. Nearly all of our locations have remained open, except in the few states or counties where construction activities were suspended, but that list of states is shrinking. We have dedicated teams in place to monitor best practices, ensure compliance with shifting local orders, and implement swift action as needed. In addition to the many safety protocols and social distancing measures that we have put in place, our investments in technology are helping us maintain our connections with customers and our overall effectiveness. This includes My BFS Builder where we complement our first-class face-to-face customer service with an innovative customer portal. Customers can quickly access details regarding their account, receive automatic notifications of delivery, download statements and make payments, all with the goal of making it easier for customers to do business with us and for the time being, minimize physical contact. Our business performed well in the first quarter, even during the month of March. We met our financial expectations and finished the quarter strong, and our value-add products were once again a major contributor to our success. Looking ahead, there are several factors I would like to call out for the coming months. During the quarter, many of our customers worked vigorously to complete existing units under construction. As a valued partner to many builders, I am proud that our teams were able to provide customers with the critical products they needed to keep projects moving. However, as the quarter ended and the economic conditions softened in April, home sales declined and new projects coming into the pipeline have not fully replaced completed projects. As a result, we have taken actions to address the softer market conditions in what we expect will be an air pocket in construction activity. Last month, we announced proactive steps to enhance our financial flexibility, liquidity, and cash flow. At the end of March, we had $672 million of total liquidity. Out of an abundance of caution, we recently tapped the debt markets to end the month of April with $1 billion of total liquidity, including $193 million of cash and no significant debt maturities for the next seven years. On the operational side, we are taking a balanced approach to mitigate the impact of reduced demand on our profitability While protecting as many existing jobs as we can, as we believe the worst of the downturn will be short-lived. Recall that in 2019, we added $25 million in EBITDA through an operational excellence initiative to optimize process and control costs in a growing market. In response to COVID-19, we are enhancing our efforts to include: resizing locations where needed; minimizing discretionary capital expenditures; optimizing working capital; limiting and delaying operating expenses; tightly managing corporate spend; and reducing Board and senior management pay. These actions, while difficult, are helping to preserve cash and profitability while maintaining our ability to efficiently respond as demand recovers. We will continue to take prudent actions to maintain a strong liquidity position and operate our business with a safety-first emphasis across our nationwide footprint. While the extent and duration of the current economic crisis remains unclear, we are well prepared to navigate through it and keep our company positioned to succeed as the economy begins to improve. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our first quarter results and balance sheet in more detail. Thank you, Peter. We have managed through prior downturns, and our business is much stronger today than it was a decade ago. Our national scale vast product portfolio and our local market density across 77 of the top 100 MSAs are just a few of the reasons. Today, high-margin value added products, which make our customers more productive and efficient, are the largest portion of our business. Our net leverage is at the low end of our long-term target and we have a much deeper and more integrated relationship with our customers than ever before. We are much more than a supplier of lumber. We are a highly valued partner to many very sophisticated builders delivering labor savings and just-in-time delivery of critical building materials, helping them maintain a streamlined supply chain. As I've mentioned several times today, we are better prepared than at any point in our history to address the rapidly evolving and unprecedented economic environment. In early April, we withdrew our full year guidance due to the uncertainty in the current homebuilding market. Our prior outlook did not contemplate the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, in regards to our previous week communicated long-range plan, despite our confidence in long-term financial goals, we are also putting our targeted 2022 timing under review until we have a better view of the economic impact of COVID. The uncertainty regarding the duration of the COBIT crisis, the pace of recovery and the lingering impacts on the economy remain unclear. As I mentioned earlier, the hurried pace by customers to complete projects during March tapered off as we move through April. This resulted in a high single-digit percent decline in core organic net sales for the month of April compared to the prior year period. We believe this was due to a combination of factors including some builders shutting down certain other construction sites due to strict shelter in place, orders conflicting local mandate and for obvious health reasons. Our teams have also noted understaffing at some critical government offices delaying, permitting and production schedules. At construction sites that are operational, the logistics have become more complex to accommodate precautions to limit the spread of the virus. And as many public builders have reported the pace of new home orders has weakened in recent months due to social distancing guidelines, stay at home recommendations and general economic uncertainty, deferring some near-term home buying activity. We believe these factors make it likely that the market environment will weaken further in the coming months at the backlog of projects that started prior to the pandemic are completed and before new starts begin to ramp up again. That said, we still believe there will be a significant base level of demand for our essential products and services. We are encouraged by the reported uptake and uptick in new home sales in the past two weeks and have seen similar trends in orders coming into our trust and panel plants. From an operational and financial perspective, we are well positioned for a challenging second order, and we'll continue to adjust our business as needed. Given the limited visibility on a length and severity of the economic impact, we have a range of internal forecast depending on many sets of future assumptions. While we are not publicly disclosing our scenario analysis based on our cost position, our capital structure, our operational excellence initiatives, and a lot of contingency planning, we believe that our business will be able to produce positive free cash flow for the remainder of the full year 2020. We remain ready to make operational adjustments and react quickly. We will continue to align our costs with the evolving demand environment and will work to preserve our strong liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. We have full confidence in our business to be the supplier of choice for building materials and value-added products in the months and years to come. Our enhanced geographic reach, diversified product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities, and strong partnerships with customers are unmatched, competitive advantage \u2013competitive advantages in any market environment. I would especially like to thank the Builders FirstSource team for their unwavering dedication to our company, customers and communities during this volatile time and into the recovery. Operator, we can now open up the call for Q&A. Personally, I don't think that's a trend that's going to reverse. It's been taking share. I think it will continue to take share. I think builders see the value in it. They see the efficiency it creates on their job sites. It requires \u2013 it can require less people and less time on the job sites. I guess there could be a few instances where builders could revert back. But in general, I don't see that trend reversing. Yes. Maybe I wasn't clear. Right now, we have no intention to pausing on operational excellence initiatives. The pausing is more on some of the growth initiatives and M&A activity. But right now, we're full speed ahead on our operational excellence initiatives. You bet. Yes, that's a great question. First of all, it wasn't just me that it was around. I bet, gosh, 75% of our team has probably been around, and that includes the guys out in the field. And one thing they are very good about is adjusting their operations for demand to changes in demand. That's not just in situations like this, but from a seasonal perspective across a given year, especially in the upper \u2013 the Northern markets where seasonality is a huge factor. That's just a way of life for them. And so, the good news is we have an experienced team that knows how to deal with it. Right now, we have the playbook ready. And to be honest, we haven't initiated all those plays yet because we haven't needed to. Our sales have held up remarkably well. Now in states where we were required to close for a period of time, we did some temporary layoffs and things like that and adjusted our cost structure, but as we've opened back up, we've been able to bring most of those folks back. Now that being said, we do anticipate a slowdown in the coming months, and we will be prepared to adjust our cost structure accordingly. I don't have the crystal ball of what this is going to look like. Personally, I think it's not going to be anything like the last crisis. I think it's going to be much shorter lived than that. I think the underpinnings are much different right now. We're not in an overbuilt position like we were 10 years ago. In fact, you could argue we were still in an underbuilt position now. Now, there will be some bumps along the way. There's a high level of unemployment that we'll have to work through, but there's still a lot of positive things that give me hope that this is going to be relatively short-lived. I think the pandemic could drive some people out of big cities and wanting some space of their own. That could drive some additional homebuilding. Mortgage rates are still low. So, there's the demographics. There's a lot of things that give me hope that this will be relatively short-lived and nothing like 10 years ago. If it gets as bad as 10 years ago, we've got a boatload of liquidity, and we'll be ready to react. So right now, I, look, we've got an experienced team, we've got a balance sheet that's got $1 billion of liquidity, and we will manage through whatever the current economic environment presents to us. But when you compare what I see coming in the next few months and few quarters to what we went through in 2008, I don't think it's going to be anything like that. Will there be a couple of rough quarters? Yes, I think there will be, but \u2013 and we'll be able \u2013 we'll be ready to pull the playbook out again. But right now, as I said, we've been very fortunate being deemed as an essential business, and our business has held up remarkably well thus far. It's more regional based. As you would expect, up in the Northeast, they've been hit the hardest. They're probably down more than any other region. The opposite of that is, gosh, down around Georgia and Florida, you wouldn't know there was anything going on. Our results so far are on plan and up first prior year. And so those are the two bookings that we're seeing and all the other reasons are kind of fallen in between that. So, we haven't really seen a difference by builder type. It's really more a geographical difference and, how much the pandemic is really shut down operations in those regions. Yes, it's great. Well, I think your assumption is correct. In states where we were closed, there is a little bit of pent-up demand there as we reopened. We see a little bit of a surge, but we still think the worst is yet to come in the next couple of months. That's a tough question on, whether it's deferrals or cancellations. Honestly I think it's got to be some of both. You've got 30 million people that are filing for unemployment now. How many of those were potential homeowners in the near-term? I don't know. But I can say in the southeast, where our results are still pretty strong. We're seeing the still a pretty solid pipeline of new starts and new construction. But I think time will tell. I wish I had the answer, but I think time will tell on whether these are deferrals or cancellations. But my guess is it's going to be some of both. Yes, I do think this will create opportunities that otherwise wouldn't have been there. What those will look like. I don't know. But clearly, as we've discussed, we took out a lot of incremental debt. Liquidity \u2013 in uncertain times, liquidity is king. In uncertain times, liquidity is a lot like a concealed weapon. I'd rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. So consider us armed and daters once this thing levels out and there's acquisition opportunities out there because personally, I don't think we're going to need that incremental liquidity, but I've learned is coming through the last downturn, it's better to have it. And so if things turn out like, I think they will, we will have ample liquidity to be able to take advantage of some these situations that will come out. Thank you. Thank you. You too. Yes. I don't know that there's a hard and fast answer to that, Keith. I think that it's a good question. It's really dependent on the customer, in the region, a couple of weeks or a couple of months. It could be a range like that. But I think one of the interesting aspects of this and we look at, at least the recent past, there is a little bit of a buffering that happens as homebuilders continue to build through a little bit of their backlog. You have sort of this ability to expand and contract the under construction. I think we've seen a little bit of that. We've already started to see some of the green shoots or initial indications that we bounced off the bottom on orders. It's a question of how long it lasts. And does it continue that trajectory? Are there multiple dips? And when it gets a little bit back to normal, what does that normal look like. And I'll just add, as we expect to see business slow in the quarter, there may be opportunities where we get a little more aggressive on price to just keep the volume coming through our facilities and keep our folks working. So that could offset some of the \u2013 any advantage we would have gotten from the fluctuation in commodity prices this time around. Well, that's also a great question and probably, the things we're struggling with the most right now. As I said earlier, thus far, we've been very fortunate in our business has held up really well. We expect to see that decline. We also still currently expect it to be a relatively short-lived. When I say, relatively short-lived, months, not years, decline. And so as long as we believe that, I am certainly willing to keep investing in, as Peter said, our key employees. Many, many folks. We've got a lot of talented team members and to let some of them go just to ride out a fairly brief downturn in our business would be \u2013 would not be the right thing to do. We want to keep these people employed, and we want to be ready for things to \u2013 when things do recover. And so that's the tough question. Every day, we learn a little more. And as we continue over the next few weeks and months, if it becomes clear that our assumptions may be off and this may be a little longer downturn, then we'll adjust accordingly. But right now, we're working under the assumption that's going to be relatively short-lived. And so there will be \u2013 anytime our business flows, there's a reduction in overtime, there's a reduction in temp labor, there's a reduction in hours worked. But as far as permanently letting people go, we want to defer that as long as we can and keep buying time in order to get some more clarity on what this thing is going to look like. No. It's not \u2013 it's the strongest region of the country right now for us. But there's other markets that you can see they've been impacted, but they haven't been near \u2013 as impacted nearly as much as you might have thought they would have been. And yes, the strength we're seeing in the Southeast is a combination of both existing orders and new orders. I don't have the percentage of sales breakout with me now, but that's probably something that maybe you could discuss with Binit later, but it's not the only region. I was just pointing out the kind of the book ends of the strongest and the most impacted when I made that comment earlier. Well, when we were talking about the customers, they're basically finishing homes that had already been started. So units under construction. They were really making sure they got those homes completed. But we did see many builders start to tap the brakes on spec homes, on new lot development and of course, traffic and new buyer activity slowed given the restraints created by the pandemic. So yes, we mentioned the April results and how they trailed off. Still all in all, a pretty strong April, in my opinion, given what's going on. But as I mentioned earlier, we are still concerned that there's kind of an air pocket of demand coming that we'll have to work through in the coming months. Good morning, Jay. No, I really haven't seen that yet. It's just something we would anticipate seeing if we see a significant drop-off in demand. I think we can safely say it's around half of that number. Thanks, Jay. I don't know that I'm ready to give a starts number yet. But look, as I said earlier, this crisis just looks a lot different than what we went through last time. I won't rehash those. But I do think there's going to be incremental demand created down the road. And you've seen some articles on it recently of renters fleeing apartments and deciding now is the time to get a bit of space of our own if \u2013 I know for our company, in particular, I'm shocked at how well this whole telecommuting thing is working. And thankfully, we have ways in place to monitor what folks are doing at home and metrics and very, very pleased with the productivity that we've seen with folks. And so if this whole telecommuting thing sticks, that's probably going to create a group of people that say, \u201cYou know what, I don't have to live near downtown anymore where it's more expensive. If I'm working from home, maybe we go out to the suburbs, where it's cheaper and we have a little space of our own. So, I think that could provide a boost down the road. And we just don't have the excess inventory in homes that we had a decade ago. Now to your point, there's a lot of unemployed people right now, and we've got to get folks back to work. And the longer we don't go back to work, that obviously, the more of this thing is going to drag out. But I just think there's a lot of still underlying strength that if we can get folks back to work that we're going to be able to flush through this. And again, I'm not talking weeks and work everything's back to normal. It very well could be \u2013 it's likely going to be months. I'm just saying it's not going to be four or five years like we saw with the last financial crisis. That's my opinion anyway. Yes. No real difference. Based on our recent performance, we might come in a little towards the lower end of the 9% to 10%. But I think things have been fairly consistent. Thanks, Reuben. Hi, Ryan. Well, thank you, once again for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our second quarter results. And if you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Binit or Peter. Thank you."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Chad. Good morning everyone. I'm proud of our team's work in delivering another quarter of strong results and supporting our customers during this dynamic time. I will streamline our first quarter review, given it is in the rearview mirror at this point. I will also highlight the structural elements that we see as important near-term considerations to help communicate our confidence in the business. We had $1.8 billion in net sales in the first quarter with core organic growth of 3.9%. You heard me use a new term right there, as we are introducing a new core organic growth metric this quarter. We believe it is an efficient way to discuss the underlying performance of our business by excluding acquisitions, commodity impacts, and differences in selling days from net sales. Net sales in total increased 9.5%. Core organic growth as I mentioned was 3.9%. Our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added 3.5% and one additional selling day contributed 1.7%. Commodity price inflation was minimal and added 0.4% to net sales. Our value added product categories again led the way on a per day and core organic basis reflecting the continued execution of our strategic plan and the emphasis of those businesses on those key products. Our gross margin percentage was 26% and in line with our expectations for the quarter. The 110 basis points decline compared to the prior year period was a result of the previously communicated normalization in our lumber and lumber sheet goods product margin. Last year, we experienced a strong tailwind due to commodity deflation, which did not recur in 2020. Amid all of the expected noise related to COVID, please continue to keep in mind the mechanics of our margins as we have discussed on prior calls. Commodity cost deflation causes short-term gross margin percentage expansion when price has dropped rapidly relative to our short-term price and commitments that we provide customers. We experienced this benefit during the first quarter of 2019, and this benefit did not recur in the first quarter of 2020. Commodity costs increased markedly in February of 2020 before retreating to prior levels in the face of COVID-related interruptions. At this point, we expect we will see a modest impact from commodity inflation in our Q2 results. Interest expense increased by $27 million to $51.9 million compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of one-time items related to debt extinguishments, interest expense was down by $1 million on a lower outstanding debt balance year-over-year. First quarter EBITDA decreased $3.9 million to $97 million representing the higher end of our expectations. The year-over-year decline was largely driven by the previously discussed normalization in our gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2020. On Slide 4, you can see that the strength of our business driven by our national scale and strong local customer relationships was again evident as our customers push to complete units under construction. Higher margin value-added products remained at 42% of total sales in the quarter with estimated volume growth of 9% in combined manufacturing \u2013 manufactured products and windows, doors, and millwork product categories. On Slide 5, our first quarter organic growth with an estimated 3% in the single family new construction end market with broad-based growth across the country. A common thread is that we grew value-added products in the single family market in all of our regions. Core organic growth in R&R and other end other was 2% on broad growth as well. Multifamily core organic improved by 19% largely due to the timing of projects started earlier in 2019 when we implemented organizational improvements. Turning to our front-end liquidity and de-risk balance sheet on Page 6, let me first address cash flow. During the quarter, we had an outflow of free cash of approximately $79 million. The first quarter is seasonally our low point for cash flow as we typically use cash in the first half of the year and build up cash in the second half. This year is clearly shaping up to be unprecedented in nature and as Chad discussed, we have taken aggressive action to preserve cash including a significant reduction in CapEx spending and an increased vigilance around working capital. Looking at our net leverage, we ended the quarter down 0.2 times compared to prior year and up 0.3 times from December 31st. The sequential increase is partly due to the funding of prior acquisitions, which are not yet fully reflected in EBITDA, as well as the normal seasonal buildup and working capital. On a pro forma basis, our net leverage was closer to the low end of our two and a half to three and a half times targeted range. With that backdrop, let's focus on the structure of our capital resources for the current environment. We have already discussed our spending in cash preservation measures, so I'll address the recent debt financing transactions that are provided, significant additional liquidity in recent months. Since the beginning of the year, we have made several moves to push out maturities and improve our access to cash. First in February, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes that mature 10 years from now in 2030. We use the proceeds to pay off $504 million of existing debt that matured in 2024, plus a portion of our 2027 notes. This transaction was opportunistic in nature and unfortunate timing ahead of COVID's impact on the economy. In April, 2020, in response to the pandemic, we raised an additional $350 million in 2027 senior notes. We use those proceeds to repay the funds drawn under our revolving credit facility and left the remainder in cash. Following these transactions, we have approximately $1 million \u2013 $1 billion of total liquidity, including $193 million of cash representing a greater than 50% increase in liquidity since the end of the first quarter. We have a term loan in the amount of $52 million due in 2024, but beyond that, we have no maturities until 2027 and a weighted average maturity schedule of eight years. That represents an almost three-year extension in our weighted average maturity schedule since the beginning of the year. Including our recent bond offering, we expect our cash interest to be in the $100 to $110 million range for the full year of 2020. We believe our balance sheet is appropriately structured to face the challenges ahead. We have no covenants worth discussing and we have over $800 million available to us on our revolver. We are prepared to draw down additional capital is needed, but do not see a reason to do so at this time based on our free cash flow expectations. In terms of capital allocation, our primary objective at this time is to preserve cash. We have put numerous investment plans on hold including acquisitions and growth CapEx. If you recall, we had originally anticipated to invest around one-third of our total 2020 capital expenditures in value-add growth initiatives. While some of those \u2013 some of that has already been spent with the deferral of growth projects, we now expect capital expenditures to be in the $75 to $85 million range for the full year. In summary, we ended the quarter with a strong capital position, have further fortified our balance sheet and have ample coverage to effectively navigate the developing economic environment. I will now turn the call back to Chad for his closing comments. I agree. We grew through the last cycle in value add. I think that there was \u2013 there's an argument to be made, there was a far more labor availability during the last cycle than there is or will be during this one. So I think there's every reason for confidence. This is a product that the homebuilders like and use and rely on. Sure. Yes. I mean the nature of our commodities is pretty consistent. We saw that run-up in pricing, sort of the middle of the first quarter, generally takes about one quarter to two quarters but that will flush through the P&L in terms of the impact on gross margins, resetting pricing. Now in this case, because it went up and then came back down again, it has the potential to be a little quicker, but you still got to work through that inventory. As far as inventory levels, our days of inventory is less than it was a year ago. We've been very disciplined about the amount of inventory we brought on to make sure that we didn't get cost behind any material changes in demand. But that said, we're still the distributor. So we have inventory on the ground. We will continue to have inventory on the ground. But I think that our performance to date has been sort of continuing the progress that we made last year in keeping that we made last year in keeping our days well managed. I think that the overall lumber and commodity pricing, both OSB and lumber ran up a bit, but it settled back down. I don't know that there's much room for it to go much lower. I would say that manufacturers have done a good job of taking capacity offline to manage. So, it's really a matter of seeing when things start to ramp back up again from a homebuilding and demand perspective as to when, if at all, the prices move. So, we definitely don't want to go down into the weaves on April. I think that the overall trends have been largely consistent what you expect from us. It's a lot of question mark about where that goes into the future as things start to transition to digest this air pocket or whatever it is we're going to call it of the shelter in place. We're already starting to see the improvement in starts \u2013 sorry, in orders through our customers. But really, we're going to have to watch our homebuilder communication, permits and starts, the normal characteristics that you'd expect us to monitor from our homebuilding customers to know when we'll expect the things to turn around. But like Chad said, there'll be a window here where it's going to get harder. Thanks. You too. Given how fast it went up and back down again, I expect it's probably the latter this time. Because it was a month or two. Hey, Kurt. Yes. You're right on, that's a great question. I don't know that I have a lot of particularly useful detail other than we maybe recap a couple of things that we've talked about in the past. Yes. We will expect to see deleveraging, to a small degree, in gross margin as demand declines. The extent of the demand will correlate to the size of the impact on margins. We certainly see the variability in SG&A as a rule of thumb being around 70% variable. The tricky part in this particular situation is that we know it's temporary. The downturn in volume is temporary. So, we may keep a few more folks around to make sure that we're ready to go on the back end. There are some critical roles in this business that are extremely hard to recruit and retain and you don't want to let them slip away because you have a 30 or a 60-day window in which you lost some volume. So that's a good question mark for us to see how bad it goes down and how much do we want to protect versus how much do we just get down the business and rescale the business as appropriate. That fall through is a good question overall for the year. Do I think it's likely to be in that range? Sure. I don't think that net directionally is wrong. But for a window of time, could it be better or worse? Yes. No, it could be. So, I think that the real obvious one, I guess, with $1 billion in liquidity, there is a clear understanding in the marketplace that we are not going anywhere and you can count on us. I think that is a desirable position to be in when you're talking with customers about how to make sure you're supporting them and working with them. It's always a dynamic environment when you're trying to react. And again, it kind of reiterated an earlier point, and some parts of the countries that are killing it that are doing great. And other parts of the country that are really suffering and happen to hunker down a big way because their customers are. Being able to partner in every one of those situations continuing to invest in our business from an operational excellence perspective, continuing to invest in the portal, continuing to be able to offer services that others can't, we think that \u2013 it's that continuity. It's that reliability and that strength that in this moment and over time, continues to give us a competitive advantage. Will it \u2013 I think the area where it may offer better opportunities are those that having come through this cycle as owners of their own smaller business decide maybe this isn't such a horrible time to pass the reins. And boy, Builders FirstSource seems like a good group to work with. Maybe we'll sell to them. So there are opportunities. It's a little too early to say because we don't know what it's really going to look like. At this point, it hasn't looked like much. Thanks, Kurt. Take care. Yes. I think Chad alluded to it a little bit, the difference between the large and small is less pronounced than the difference between hard-hit regions and those regions not seeing nearly the impact. It's \u2013 I think that's \u2013 it's substantial. It's kind of hard to overstate how different those two regional indicators are. Now, as far as the cash flow and the collections, as you can imagine, we have been paying particularly close attention to that. The good news is our days are better this year than they were last year. So we have not seen a decay in our performance today. We are certainly being thoughtful about it and being conservative and staying close to our customers whenever there are any delays or indicators of stress that we are staying close. But I think at this point, based on the relatively modest decline in what has happened so far in terms of sales, we certainly have not seen any issues there. Thank you. Yes. I don't know if we have an exact estimate. It's a substantial \u2013 they're \u2013 I don't like in the same drum again. There's a massive difference between those regions, right? Pacific Northwest, where they shut down Washington; the Northeast, where they've been most deeply impacted, Michigan, as you described. Those numbers are materially different than what you're seeing in the rest of the country. So, I think it's fair to say, yes. We certainly don't want to imply guidance on the margins. I think that when we've talked about incrementals and decrementals in the past as sort of the curvature has alluded to. We're talking low double digits, so 12% to 15% is sort of a rule of thumb. And to reiterate, I guess, a little bit about the comment about the \u2013 if we hold on \u2013 if the worst-case scenario happens and we hold on to people a little longer than we should, then it does turn out to be down more. Of course, that's going to make that a little bit worse on the downside. But it would recover over time because we'll see that stabilized at a lower level. We'll take the appropriate actions to reset margins and cost levels to where they need to be. Thank you. Good morning, Reuben. Yes. Definitely, some green shoots are good news. Not all good because there are some offsetting headwinds. So, the short answer is some of our more retail-focused businesses have seen a nice little uptick. As you know, we own the 50 Line San Lorenzo brands in California. They're doing quite well in the retail. Some other parts of the country doing well also. Unfortunately, there's \u2013 we also have our brand \u2013 our retail brand up in Alaska, and the Alaska market has really been hit hard. They've gotten a double whammy of oil as well as COVID. So, they're certainly being hurt by all this. So, I think we're doing well in that space, a couple of weaker pockets geographically, but certainly happy with our performance there overall. Thank you. Yes. As you can imagine, that caught our attention. We pay pretty close attention to the single-family numbers. The tricky part, and we talked a little bit about it at the end of last quarter is that we had a really strong end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. I think it's fair to say we took a boat load of share and so you're looking at some tough comps. I would also argue the numbers are a little bit odd. I personally have a hard time believing that there isn't some mathematical anomaly in that February starts number. It just doesn't ring true to what the market is doing. I think that if you smooth that out a little bit, for us, if you look at it over the last year, we netted a tremendous amount of share. Is there a little bit of pushback from our competitors and people trying to take some of that share back? Sure, yes, no doubt. But I think that we feel good about our share position about having net taken share. And I think we felt really good coming into the year. I mean it's \u2013 I know we blew by Q1, but it's a little tough to swallow just how well we were doing in Q1 and how the momentum of the business and the demand was building only to sort of be snuffed out by the COVID dynamics, and now we're just going to \u2013 we'll navigate through this bit, but I think we're starting from a position of strength. We generally don't get into the granularity of the individual product categories. I would say, on a year-over-year basis, we certainly had some tailwind within those manufactured products, but the component of it that has a good aspect of it in 2019. So, on a year-over-year basis, it would have trended a little. But I think it's a very healthy part of our business. Margins have been strong and we're continuing to stay disciplined on pricing and particularly in that category where we think we bring a lot of value to the table."

Michael Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource, will now provide the company's opening remarks.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Britney. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our record fourth quarter and full year results for 2021. We've provided results that include BMC in the fourth quarter of 2021 and stand-alone BFS in the fourth quarter of 2020. We've also provided pro-forma results, as we own BMC in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. The fourth quarter press release and investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. On behalf of the entire company, we want to thank everyone who attended our Investor Day in-person or virtually and for your continued interest in and support of Builders FirstSource. I would encourage you to visit our Investor Day slides and commentary on our IR website at bldr.com. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should not be considered in isolation for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call, contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2021 was a phenomenal year for our company. We achieved four straight quarters of double digit core organic growth, delivering above market performance and record results. I want to thank our more than 28,000 team members for an incredible year. I'm extremely proud of their outstanding results, despite the many supply chain challenges and strong demand that is impacting our industry. I'll cover three key topics on today's call, which speak to the strength of our business and the strategy that is enabling us to excel as a leader in our space. First, I'll provide an update on our record full-year results, including our base business and our view of the current state of the housing market. Peter will discuss our fourth quarter results in his remarks. Second, I'll provide an update on our tuck-in acquisitions that continue to strengthen our industry-leading market position. And finally, I'll provide an update on our digital strategy, which we laid out during our Investor Day in December. As you know, we are the nation's leading supplier of structural building and value-added products and services, primarily to the residential construction market. We are a consolidator in our industry with arguably the best balance sheet of anyone in the space. We have a long track record of successful execution, combined with a very strong value proposition, a highly differentiated platform, and an unwavering commitment to customer-focused solutions. We are now 14 months into combining BFS and BMC with plenty of low-hanging fruit remaining for us to continue to harvest as we look to accelerate growth, capture synergies, and drive new productivity. Before I review our full-year results, I would like to highlight an important slide from our Investor Day. As we discussed during that event, we believe it is important to assess our results on a base business basis to better appreciate the underlying growth and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 3, over the next four years, we expect our base business to deliver a 10% CAGR on the top line, a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR and, importantly, a 50 basis points per year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points by 2025. Given the strength of our cash flow and the leverage target that we laid out last year between 1 and 2 times adjusted base business EBITDA, we expect to have $7 billion to $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025, and we will put that capital to work through continued investments in innovation and organic growth, accretive tuck-in M&A, and returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by the recent announcement of our third $1 billion share repurchase program in the last seven months. Turning to Slide 4. On a pro forma basis, we delivered an impressive single family core organic growth of approximately 28% in 2021. Meaningfully exceeding the single family starts growth of 13.6%. We produced record sales of nearly $20 billion to deliver $3.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. As you can see on Slide 5, our base business is strong as we grew sales by 26% to $15.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA by an outstanding 63%, while our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 250 basis points to 11.2%. Our momentum carried through the fourth quarter, in which we delivered $4.6 billion of revenue and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.1% on the strength of robust demand for housing, pricing discipline, and our continued focus on serving our customers with our value-added offerings. Last month, we attended the International Builders\u2019 Show in Orlando. Based on our conversations with many customers and suppliers, we believe demand for single family housing will remain strong headed into the spring homebuilding season. We are encouraged from these anecdotal conversations, but more importantly, by the double digit top line increases that we have seen in our results so far this year. The number of single family homes under construction increased 27% in 2021 versus 2020. One fact I'd like to remind you of is that there are currently more single-family homes under construction across the country than there have been in more than 14 years. And the homebuilder backlog is currently at the highest level it's been in the last 15 years. Backlogs, in fact, were an estimated 145,000 single-family units authorized, but not yet started as of last month, up 32% year-over-year, an encouraging sign of continued demand strength. On Slide 6, you will see that we also remain focused on executing our strategy of investing in inorganic growth. We have completed seven acquisitions for $1.2 billion since we closed on the BMC merger, and we believe we can invest at least $500 million each year in accretive M&A to augment our organic growth strategy. And as such, we will remain a disciplined consolidator in our industry for many years to come as we continue to focus on expanding an attractive high-growth markets and product categories. On December 31, we closed on our most recent acquisition of National Lumber, the largest independent building materials supplier in New England. National Lumber operates 16 facilities and employs more than 700 people across Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island with a diverse mix of products and end markets. This acquisition adds to our value-added portfolio and provides a favorable R&R mix in the New England area where we previously did not have a presence. We're excited to welcome the National Lumber team members to the Builders FirstSource family. Now, let me provide a brief update on our digital strategy on Slide 7. As a reminder, during our Investor Day, we provided an in-depth commentary on Paradigm and how they anchor our digital strategy. Our teams are working with our customers to pilot our technology, aiming to improve the pre-construction process, create more accurate material lists, bring our supply partners into a digital workflow and better engage homebuyers. We're actively pursuing several initiatives to advance our digital transformation. Among them, we continue to deploy paradigm estimate across more markets to accelerate customer quotations, and we are working on a specific pilot with a customer in South Carolina to improve our understanding of how to connect the home builders front-end sales process, utilizing paradigm visualization technology to enable a full band execution model and enhance home-building efficiency. We're making investments and executing projects that we believe will put us at the center of the homebuilding ecosystem. While these concepts may be basic, relative to other industries, they simply do not yet exist the scale in residential homebuilding. We believe we're on our path to revolutionize our industry for the benefit of our customers and to us, this represents an incremental $1 billion growth opportunity over the next five years. Next, on Slide 8, I'm pleased to announce that we've delivered $32 million in BMC merger-related cost synergies during the fourth quarter for a total of $108 million for the full year 2021, I can also announce that we have achieved a synergy run rate of $160 million as we exited 2021, well in excess of our $130 million to $150 million commitment at the announcement of the merger, and we captured those synergies two years faster than what we initially projected. I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome of our merger integration. With our merger-related synergy capture now officially completed, we have turned our attention to ramping up our internal productivity efforts. In 2022, we expect to capture total P&L productivity and synergy savings of $150 million, and we'll provide updates on our progress as the year proceeds. I believe great companies, and we are one, drive productivity on an ongoing basis and reinvest a portion of those savings to fuel future growth. We unveiled our BFS 1-TEAM operating system at our Investor Day, and the best way to think about that is continuous improvement in three key areas of our business. The first two are building people and building excellence. And as we do those two well, we will deliver the third, which is driving growth. Long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of the annual productivity improvement through our BFS 1-TEAM operating system. Looking at our progress as a combined company, we are clearly leveraging the strength of our industry-leading product portfolio, national network, and disciplined operating model alongside the robust demand environment to deliver exceptional growth, profitability, and free cash flow. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities to invest both organically and with M&A while returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. With a thoughtful and disciplined approach to deploying our capital, we are transforming the homebuilding industry through our investments in digital, expanding value-added offerings for our customers, and making strategic acquisitions that bolster and extend our industry leadership position. For 2022, we expect a continued strong execution by our team, combined with our diverse portfolio of value-added offerings, will enable us to deliver double-digit net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in our base business. Our team members continue to impress me at every turn from the sales forward to the yard and everywhere in between. Their commitment to excellence is where it keeps this company moving forward, and I love to highlight their collective and individual progress. For example, Alonzo Christian, the delivery manager at our Williamsburg, Virginia lumber location, gets his team started at 5:00 AM to ensure that Builders FirstSource trucks are the first out every morning to maximize seeing our customers each day. Not only does this give us a strategic advantage, but it shows our customers that BFS will be there for them when they need it, especially as they confront supply chain and labor challenges. With Alonzo's leadership, the yard runs efficiently and safely with no recordable injuries over the past five years, coupled with remarkably low-operating expenses and team member turnover. In total, we've made great progress in keeping our people safe. In the last year, we delivered an 18% reduction in recordable injuries across the company, beating our 10% reduction target, and we have another 10% improvement targeted for this year. It's a journey that never ends and we're getting better, but we're not going to stop. Our goal is zero. I'm grateful to team members like Alonzo who embody our core values, putting people first and showing our customers why BFS is the most valuable partner in the industry. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q4 results and provide an update on our new share repurchase program and our 2022 updated financial guidance.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I want to add my thanks to our team members for delivering an outstanding and record 2021. We wouldn't have been able to deliver such fantastic results without your hard work, your dedication, and your focus on our customers. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our fourth quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior-year quarter. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment. And third, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full-year 2022. Let's begin with our Q4 performance on Slide 9. We had net sales of $4.6 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 24% compared to the combined pro forma prior-year period. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 28%, highlighting our work to meet the strong demand across our value-added channels, especially impressive given the continued supply chain constraints. Despite the price volatility, commodity price inflation benefited net sales by 5% and acquisitions contributed another 7%. Gross profit was $1.5 billion, an increase of 52% compared with the combined pro forma prior year period. Gross margin increased 610 basis points to 32.1%, driven mainly by cost increases coupled with disciplined pricing, as well as effective and timely sourcing in a volatile, supply constrained marketplace. For the full year, our gross margin increased 360 basis points to 29.4%. Following this recent performance and our increasing mix of value-added products, we believe our normalized gross margins will now be approximately 27% or better compared to our prior expectation of 26.5%, a 50 basis point increase. For the quarter, SG&A was $864 million, an increase of approximately $189 million or 28% compared to the combined pro-forma prior-year period, driven primarily by expense related to the BMC merger and other acquisitions, including amortization expense of acquired intangibles and onetime charges. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 60 basis points to 18.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 110% to $793.4 million, driven by solid demand across our key customer end markets, combined with disciplined pricing on increasing costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 17.1%, which increased 700 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro-forma period. In the fourth quarter, net income was $442.5 million or $2.31 per share compared to combined pro forma net income of $200.7 million or $0.96 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $532.4 million or $2.78 of adjusted EPS. This compares to a combined pro forma adjusted net income of $225.5 million or $1.08 of adjusted EPS in the prior-year period. The 136.1% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income tax and SG&A expense. The 157.4% increase in adjusted EPS is driven by the increase in adjusted net income coupled with our reduced share count, which I'll cover in a moment. Now, let's turn to cash flow. Our fourth quarter operating cash flow was approximately $840 million, driven by increased net sales and the impact of inflation. Free cash flow was $774 million during the quarter. Turning to Slide 12, for 2021, our full year free cash was an inflow of $1.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of commodity inflation and core organic growth. The free cash flow for 2021 was a bit lower than our forecasted guide as a result of higher than expected sales driving an increase in year-end working capital due in large part to rising commodity prices later in the year. Let's turn to our capital deployment. For the full year of 2021, our M&A bolt-on strategy resulted in our purchasing seven companies for approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 16.5 million shares of BFS common stock at an average price of $70.89 for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in August of 2021, we have repurchased 30.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $2 billion for an average price of $65.43 per share. That's more than 15% of our shares outstanding while maintaining a rock solid balance sheet. We have completed the share repurchase programs authorized in August and November of 2021. In February 2022, the board then authorized another $1 billion share repurchase program. As we mentioned during the Investor Day, we plan to deploy $5 billion to $7 billion of capital by 2025. Of the $3 billion of share repurchase authorizations announced today, $2 million pass towards our target. We accelerated $700 million of the second-billion authorization at the end of 2021 and finished the remaining $300 million in January. As you may have seen, last month, we completed a private offering of an additional $300 million of our 2032 notes at an issue price equal to 105% of our value. Net proceeds from the offerings were used to repay borrowings on the 2026 ABL facility. In addition, the company amended the 2026 facility to increase the total commitments by an aggregate amount of $400 million, resulting in a new $1.8 billion amended credit facility. Also on Slide 12, our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.7 times our base business EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long term debt maturities until 2027, and our total liquidity was over $700 million as of year-end, consisting of about $686 million in net borrowing availability and $43 million in cash. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results were tremendous. The merger of BFS and BMC has gone better than expected, the combined field sales team is driving higher margin products and delivering value to our customers, and our balance sheet is strong. Let's change gears and discuss our 2022 full year outlook on Slide 13. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. We are estimating single family starts growth across our geographies in the middle single digits. R&R and Multi Family growth in the low-to-mid-single digits. Going forward, we are going to provide you with our base business guide on net sales and EBITDA as we believe this is a better measurement of our performance and assumes constant commodity costs at $400 per thousand. We'll continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. We expect base business net sales to grow approximately 8% to 12% over 2021 net sales of $15.7 billion. We expect base business adjusted EBITDA to grow 12% to 18% over 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion. The growth in these metrics is consistent with the long-term plan we communicated our December 7 Investor Day. CapEx is projected to be approximately $400 million in 2022. The increase from prior year is due to adding capacity in several of our facilities, largely related to value-added growth initiatives that will drive higher-margin results. In 2022, we expect productivity gains will contribute another $150 million to EBITDA, of which $50 million will come from the realization of BMC synergies. We believe free cash flow will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion, assuming an average commodity price in the range of $600 to $1,000 for the year. This assumes working capital coming down due to lower commodity prices in the back half of 2022. On Slide 14, we provide the sensitivity chart I mentioned, providing a way to think about our total sales and total adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 at various static commodity price points. It's important to note that our base business outlook is the same under any of these commodity assumptions. While we are not providing explicit guidance for total sales in total adjusted EBITDA, we believe this table is helpful in understanding the relationship between expected base commodity performance and total results under various commodity assumptions. We believe 2022 will be another strong year of growing our value-added products and profitability, outperforming the market, introducing innovative technology, and driving operational excellence across our geographic footprint. I'm proud of our 2021 performance and excited for what is in store for 2022. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Flitman: Thank you, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry is resilient, underbuilt, and we believe will continue to grow in 2022. As a result of the hard work of our team members every day, our company's momentum remains strong. We are leveraging our industry-leading platform to grow and sustain our profitability and will continue to benefit from our robust record free cash flow generation. We are poised to transform the homebuilding industry through our investments in value-added products and services and expanding our digital offerings. Our M&A pipeline remains strong and attractive, and we have the balance sheet to continue to execute on this important pillar of our strategy. We will remain disciplined in doing so. We are committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment and in our most recent $1 billion Committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment, and our most recent $1 billion share repurchase authorization is another indication of this commitment. We have a very clear and simple business strategy that our team is fully committed to implementing, and I've never been more excited about our potential in our future. Britney, let\u2019s please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Bouley: So, I want to start the question on the digital slide. Very helpful color there and everything you\u2019ve done for the past few months. Can you - I guess a two-partner. Number one, can you speak specifically that minimum viable product, is that the integration of Builder Omni and Estimator, kind of what stage are you in there? And part two is just more broadly, what are some of the next batch benchmarks that we, as analysts and investors can look out for on the digital progress this year? Thank you.\nDave Flitman: Sure. Great question, Matt. We outlined a lot of this at our Investor Day, but as we anticipated and communicated in the Investor Day, we do anticipate the next year to 18 months to be heavily development-focused. So to your point, we are taking Estimate, Omni for homebuilders and building this transactional capability that we spoke about. Importantly, in terms of milestones, again, we're going to be headed down this year, pouring in a lot of energy around development. And I think, we spoke about one pilot that we have going on in South Carolina. There are several other pilots that we have going on testing various theories of our case and how we might put this platform together. And I just would expect that we will continue the share progress as we learn through those and certainly as we work towards the commercialization of the platform through the course of time.\nMatthew Bouley: Thanks, Dave. And then secondly, I want to ask on that step up in CapEx. Peter, I heard you say you're sort of pressing on adding capacity. I think in the past, we had thought that even the truss plans were relatively low spend from a dollar perspective. So, I guess the question is just sort of what level of capacity are you looking to add here? Does this also include kind of step up in digital investment and other automation? Just what are some of the pieces of that stepped up CapEx guide? Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Thanks, Matt. That's a great question. I think you hit the nail on the head with your initial comments. The focus is really around value add. And what you're seeing here is that the same fleet size of the company having grown substantially as well as the acceleration we're trying to invest in. So this is new facilities. We have a number of those and we'll continue to talk about them. This is new lines within existing facilities. It's new equipment within existing lines, in existing facilities, and as well as the maintenance and the core of the operation rights. We're talking about fleet and force and all the different markets and things that we would need throughout the business. A little bit of inflation in there, but the bulk of it is core, the core maintenance and a substantial increase on that value add - value add side of the business. We're seeing a ton of demand. We're certainly seeing capacity particularly in hot markets be used up very, very quickly. And we're trying to make sure we stay on our front foot and stay aggressive given our cash flow and what we're able to do with it.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open\nUnidentified Analyst: It\u2019s actually, [Chris Cohen]. Congrats on the results. Very impressive stuff so far. I want to touch on the free cash flow guidance for next year, $1.6 billion to $2 billion is very impressive, particularly given the step up in CapEx. So, I was wondering, obviously, commodity - the commodity outlook is going to dictate the range a bit, but I was hoping you could help give us your thoughts on what you're expecting from the non-commodity side of business. Obviously, incrementals have been very strong so far this year, and I was wondering you could touch on the outlook there and some of the other puts and takes embedded in that guide.\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yes. I mean, to talk to the basics, we are expecting to continue to see good growth. You know we have to give you a commodity range in order to make the cash flow work. Right? It\u2019s not a base business metric. Cash flow isn't leased. So we did give you a midpoint. Your guess is as good or better than mine in terms of what commodities will be. Our job is to make sure we continue to deliver on profitable business related to it. But the overall growth - you saw top line in the base business being a midpoint of 10% in line with what we did, too, in Investor Day. Again the EBITDA growing midpoint of that 15% in line with what we said on Investor Day. In that fall through, we think we'll continue to work in line with our discipline around working capital. And what we've seen is it's still a healthy market, while there is certainly a lack of availability and supply in certain key areas. We are managing both our air and inventory very well, and I think the balance of our working capital is still healthy, so that combination, along with the other components which we have here in terms of the inputs on the cash flow are pretty much in line with prior year. And we think that certainly supports our commentary around the strong cash flow that we have seen and we expect to continue to see from this business in the coming years and kind of circles back to that Investor Day commentaries. We think by 2025, we\u2019re going to be deploying between $7 billion and $10 billion of cash, this is one installment of that cash.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. And just turning to capital allocations, I was hoping you could maybe give us your thoughts on priorities here. Obviously, the free cash flow supports a lot of options that are just - just your latest thoughts.\nDave Flitman: Yes, I would - this is Dave. I don't expect any change in our approach to capital allocation. We always have said and stated publicly that our first priority is to invest and grow organically inside our company. And as Peter just highlighted for you, we have great opportunities and have been doing that. Secondly, is finding the right accretive M&A to do and appoint for our $1.2 billion of spend in that area last year. And finally, where we have excess cash, we will return it to our shareholders. So, I don't expect any near-term shift in what we said are our priorities.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: And let me add my congratulations as well. I was just curious if you can just give us quick update on how some of these recent tuck-in M&As have gone and sort of your early read on how the integration is going there, whether it's the Arizona [indiscernible] in California?\nDave Flitman: Yes. I would just say that every one of the acquisitions that we did last year, we were excited about the day we announced them, and we're even more excited about them once we've got through the integration. Our most recent one, National Lumber, we've got a great team up there. Again, that's an area where we didn't have a footprint. As you know, not a tremendous region for starters, but they have an increased mix of R&R business and are the market leader across those three states. So consistent with how we've approached those acquisitions in times past, we're looking to augment our capability and our mix through value-added R&R and strengthen our footprint either in geographies where we do have a presence and are underrepresented in some of the value-added portions of the business or go in with scale into a market where we haven't been like you just saw us do in National - with National. And also s you saw us do with Alliance last summer in Arizona.\nKetan Mamtora: And then just on the supply chain side, I'm just curious on what you guys are seeing in terms of material availability, so absenteeism from just a labor standpoint. Is that really driving growth and offsite performance as you talk with your customers.\nDave Flitman: Yes. I mean, we've seen continued trends consistent with what we've talked about as recently as Investor Day. Those labor challenges and supply chain challenges have not abated. There might be pockets of improvement in some product areas but, broadly, is still challenged. I think that's consistent with what you've heard on a recent homebuilder commentary. And again, our value-added component adoption in particular, is strong. We've been driving that trend for a number of years, and we've just continued to see that accelerate really broadly across all of our geographies as our customers have gotten more comfortable with the offerings, importantly, continue to fight those labor challenges, which we believe are going to persist for a long time to come. So, we see strong tailwind both in terms of demand as well as the adoption of the value-added portions of our business.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Your line is open.\nAdam Baumgarten: Just thinking about maybe the new construction business. Just what are you guys seeing on homebuilder cycle times? It seems like they extended a bit in 4Q. Just curious if year-to-date here, if you\u2019ve seen that continue, or maybe there's some stabilization?\nDave Flitman: Well, I think as you point out, Adam, I mean, we saw cycle times extend really going back to early days of the pandemic, given the ramp up in the demand and the supply chain challenges, which kind of overlaid with that. We really haven't seen that abate significantly through the course of time here. And importantly, I think, even if we were going to see some improvement on the supply chain side, what happened when Omicron hit was we saw a lot of our suppliers face those challenges late last year, and in particular in January of this year. And we're just unable really to catch up on the backlog. So, we really haven't seen any abatement of the supply chain challenges broadly. Like I said earlier, maybe a few pockets of improvement, but things are kind of status quo on that front from our view.\nAdam Baumgarten: And then just thinking about guidance, the base business revenue growth of 8% to 12%, how should we think about the price versus volume split there?\nPeter Jackson: Well, I mean, we've certainly seen strong margins over the last year. There has been a lot of work as we've described in the past that improving our management of price, we've seen a tremendous amount of movement on the cost side and trying to stay very disciplined in their pass-through disciplines around that as well. As you look at both 2021 and 2022, we do believe there was some improvement in price. We haven\u2019t given the split historically. We probably won't do that for the foreseeable future, but certainly seeing both of those as being tailwinds for us in both 20221 and 2022.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.\nTrey Grooms: Dave, you mentioned seeing double-digit growth so far this year. I missed it in the comments maybe. But was that overall or was that in the base business?\nDave Flitman: That was overall across our business. But importantly, we're talking about kind of organic volume growth across the company here in the first couple of months.\nTrey Grooms: Okay. Organic. Got it. And then on the incremental margins, I know you touched on it a little bit earlier, but just to get into the weeds a little bit more here. You put up strong incremental margins on the base business in 2021. And in 2022, the guide implies kind of a wide range there. I think it's like 12% to 26%, I think it might be the range on incremental margins. And I think the midpoint, something like 17%. So, could you talk about what are some of the puts and takes there that could get us to the high or low end of that range, given that it is a pretty wide range there?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, Trey. This is Peter. So, my goal there was to give you guys a range of our outcomes. I think we all understand the volatility of some of that inputs this year. We've certainly got a few curveballs thrown at us already in 2022. I - what I will tell you as we build out our plans and look at the materials that the field is prepared in conjunction with their conversations with customers with our plans for new facilities, for productivity, for all the initiatives we're managing internally. We are really on that midpoint. That's where we think it'll be. Now, certainly, the potential for movements up and down and the supply chain availability movements up and down to starts that we think that will influence within supply chain is really the biggest limiting factor today. External factors, probably not as big of a deal, I don't think we're seeing a lot of risk associated with anything to do with what's going on in Europe and Ukraine right now. I think most of what we're looking at is the work around clearing those supply chain backlogs and continuing to get labor into job sites or at least into manufacturing facilities that need those job sites to make sure we're keeping the process flowing. But those are the big variables.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.\nSteven Ramsey: To start on windows, millwork, and doors, you\u2019ve got strong organic growth there. You talked about material availability improving. Was that broadly where certain products within that group? And then secondly, it seems like production from the manufacturers was more challenged in December and January with COVID. Do you think this tightens again in the next few months?\nDave Flitman: And just my comments earlier weren't aimed at any particular product category. We have seen a little abatement in a few. I might mention interior doors, but exteriors are still very tight, so it really varies. Windows might be incrementally better on lead times than they were six months ago, but they're still double-digit weeks kind of lead time. So, that's my point. Incremental improvement but not any major relief broadly across the supply chain, Steven, is what I point to.\nSteven Ramsey: And then CapEx nearly doubling year-over-year for greater revenue capacity. Is this broad CapEx or is this targeted geographically? And then how much of this is potentially delayed spend from 2021?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So geographically speaking, I think it's a little bit predictable. Where we're putting new capacity is where there is a lot of growth. The smile phase or the banana phase, whatever descriptor you choose, those southern and coastal stars-focused communities is where we're particularly strong and certainly seeing, over time, an increased adoption of that manufactured product offering whereas, historically, maybe it wasn't as concentrated as northern state. So a lot of focus definitely in value add. And in those states, I don't think there's much in the way of catch-up. Off at the top of my head, I can't think of anything that we've deferred at all. It's somewhat to do maybe catchup if you want to attribute it to supply chain and availability issues. We've seen a little bit of improved relief in some of those categories. Again, not as much as we'd like but, as Dave mentioned, incremental improvement.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid Manthey: First off, on the 2021 base of revenues and EBITDA on Slide 13, is it correct to assume that those figures exclude the divested gypsum operations and exclude all 2021 acquisitions?\nPeter Jackson: So, we did exclude - well, because the business wasn't owned, we do not have anything included. We didn't go back into the prior periods and pull it out. It's actuals. To that end, what we purchased the component of the year is included, so you'll get the lapping effect of the 2022 or on 2022 for both of those.\nDavid Manthey: Yes, mainly to follow up on that definition. But just as you look at the 2022 growth outlook and then the information on Slide 14, those include known acquisitions then is what you're saying, Peter?\nPeter Jackson: They include closed acquisitions. Right? So, we, of course, are continuing as we described to pursue M&A opportunities, but we don't have any forecast in there in 2022 for what incremental ones, just what we've already closed as of year-end. So, including national, but nothing beyond that.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And then another definition factor here. Year-to-date, obviously, lumber has averaged well over $1,000 per 1,000, but does your assumption of $400 lumber include the two months that are actuals and then the remainder at $400 or less than $400. Or are you just straight lining $400 from January 1, 2022 without regard of what actually happened here year-to-date?\nPeter Jackson: Yes - no, that\u2019s a great question. And I think our goal of here is to be very, very static in all of the commentary we're making about commodities. Everything based assumes $400 for every period, for every year always. We\u2019ll let you know of that $400. We think it's appropriate to change that $400 at some point, but for the time being, $400 is the number and applies equally to all those periods. So, why \u2013it\u2019s why I\u2019ve used the phrase static a few times, because as we all know, commodities is - if it's one thing, it's not static. But in order to give you a nice clean comparison to help you understand the core of the business, that base business metric, that's why we use that. So our number, if you want to think about it this way for cash, assumes that $600 to $1,000, that's an average. It\u2019s an average for the year, and it would assume that we would be in the midpoint of that in order to generate that kind of cash flow. And so, if you're thinking about the sensitivity page, we'd like you to think about your average for the year, sort not just emulate or replicate a static commodity number for the year. Does that help?\nOperator: We will take our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nCollin Verron: Just given the rising interest rates and affordability pressures, what gives you confidence that single family starts will grow in that mid-single digit range? And I guess, how are you thinking about growth in 2023 and 2024 if rates continue to rise and pressure affordability?\nDave Flitman: Yes. I would say obviously we've been talking about affordability challenges for quite some time. I would characterize our confidence around two things. First of all, a lot of in-depth conversations with our customers and suppliers as we've talked about the strength of the backlog, which I commented on. And importantly, two underlying fundamentals here that are probably much different than in times past. First is just the demand strength that we've seen over the last several years. We're talking about millennials who's driving the home buying, particularly the first time buyer or this first time step-up buyer. That dynamic has not changed. And secondly and importantly, and we've talked about this at length, the huge overbuilding that's occurred in this industry over the last decade and overlaid with that strong demand. We have a lot of confidence that that will continue to drive growth not only this year, but for a long time to come. At some point, the interest rates could become a factor. We're certainly not hearing that at current levels from our customers today.\nCollin Verron: And then how should we think about the cadence of base business sales growth in 2022 just given the pretty difficult comps that you're going to be facing and the current backlog of homes that are still under construction in the US?\nDave Flitman: Yes. So, on the base business side, it's consistent, right, with the overall growth. You're right about the costs getting more difficult, right? And we had a pretty nice stretch there of solid double-digit percentage growth. We think that will slow this year, obviously. But I think as you look at the actions being taken in the market, we hope to see or we expect to see incremental, as Dave mentioned, over time, relief on supply chain side. And we think that\u2019ll roll out of the market to continue to accelerate. Again, that demand, for a variety of reasons, we think is very, very healthy. So there's room for growth, both from orders already taken but we think from customers eager to get in as well.\nCollin Verron: Okay. And just to clarify, I guess does that mean that growth - sales growth will be more back half-weighted in 2022 just given the difficult comps and supply chain loosening or do you think you can deliver pretty consistent growth throughout the year?\nDave Flitman: I think it's more of the latter. We saw growth all year. We'll need to continue to see incremental as the year goes on. We think that will be supported with that relief on the supply chain side.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist. Your line is now open.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. On the base business growth that you've highlighted, I assume your manufacturing products will be growing faster than that. Give me an idea of what you're thinking in this guidance and how much can you - I mean, what's your limit average there given capacity?\nPeter Jackson: We don't break it out at that manufacture product level in terms of specific guide, but you're right. It is growing faster. I think that really what you're seeing now, Keith, is the next leg of the growth that we've been hoping for, and that's the expansion of the utilization of those manufactured products into markets that historically haven't adopted it. Some of the southern markets where you have not seen the adoption of manufactured products because there was a substantial amount of available framing labor, and it was relatively cheap. The nature of the speed of the recovery and how aggressive homebuilders are being trying to get homes built, trying to compensate for the extended build cycles is really, really common to fruit on the tree of manufactured products. We are seeing rapid growth there. We talk about manufacturing - or how value add was up 28%, high 20s across the board for 2021. Those are heady numbers, but we think we can continue to see growth. The challenge for us is we sort of harvested the second shift stop, now you're talking about really putting to work the numbers that we're investing in, that real new capacity. We feel good about it. We have a great track record of doing it, and we expect it will continue to grow those strong double digits definitely better than the rest of the business throughout 2022.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nKurt Yinger: I just wanted to start out on the pricing side in Q4. Could you just talk about some of the dynamics that drove commodity to be a year-over-year tailwind? Just looking at the composites on the lumber and panel side, kind of flat to lower. And then as we think about modeling the impact from commodity fluctuations going forward, is there a certain level of other inflation being passed through there that we should be considering in terms of maybe dampening that downside?\nDave Flitman: So, well, a couple of comments. First of all, you're right. It was pretty dynamic, right? We had talked openly about how we felt like it was important to use $400 as our long-term average We're at about the 10-year average for commodity prices. And I think it's fair to say that I took a little grief over putting that number out there, but we kind of saw that number in September. So, a lot of volatility last year to go to 1,600 to 400 million back to 1,300 plus right now. A lot of that flow through in terms of volatility in the fourth quarter. The fall and when the products came through, then the run, and when we started to see the impacts on working capital in sales, that\u2019s a big piece. Those are always tricky to guide you on and to give you some good tools. It's the turn that's always the most difficult part model, as you know. What we expect to happen is sort of consistent and then we will continue to focus on passing through cost pricing on replacement, staying disciplined about what we have availability on and being careful to support customers and be clear and candid with them about what they can get and what they can't and why but are disciplined around pricing, around inventory purchases and around inventory management. And on the ground days, it continues and we will continue to invest in it over time. I think that to reiterate something that maybe I - maybe you heard me say in the past, we do think there is a moderation on the amount of gross margin tailwind and headwind versus who we have been in past the year. We think as prices inflate and deflate as they do in commodities, we are seeing less of an expansion and contraction in our gross margins than we have historically.\nKurt Yinger: And I guess kind of leads in to my second question. Could you just talk about how the gross margins could you just talk about how the gross margins trended over the course of the quarter and what you're seeing in Q1 as commodities have really taken off? And then second, is that 27% kind of normalized gross margin, what's embedded, I guess, loosely within that profitability grid in terms of at the different lumber and panel price levels?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So, let me draw a distinction that that normalized is ignoring anything unusual or outside of the base business metric for commodity prices. So, just to say right, this is at normal banks at normal prices, we think we're at 27%. There is another layer that I'm sure you appreciate. I think we are seeing unusual margins based on the supply chain issues that we're experiencing right now. I don't want to give anybody the impression that 29%, 32% margins or the reduced margins if you exclude the commodity component and just look at phase that those are normal. We think we're in a bit of a displaced time right now. We think over time, things will refer back to a normalized gross margins of around 27% or better. Obviously, we're doing our best to manage that carefully, to improve our productivity, to add overall performance to those gross margin numbers. But we're trying to give people an insight that as we've seen that value add grow and as we've seen our business stabilize around the country, we feel very good about our ability to revalue for what we're providing and to partner with customers. And we think 27% gross margin is a better basis. We've certainly seen strong performance both in the fourth quarter and into Q1. I think that's been pretty consistent, even though we're laughing more difficult comps on the revenue line.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.\nStanley Elliott: Thank you, guys for fitting me in. A quick question about the national lumber, you mentioned the integration\u2019s going well. That\u2019s got such a higher mix of our R&R, is there any way to comment on what you're learning from that particular market. As at the Analyst Day, you guys talked about trying to expand the R&R part of the business overall. Curious what you've learned so far from that integration?\nPeter Jackson: Well, it's early days and obviously, more color to come on that. We\u2019ve got them for - right at two months. We got a company full of great people that have a very strong market position, and that's more an R&R market up there. So, what we are learning is the product portfolio that they have, the growth that they've developed consistently over time aimed at R&R. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be significant learnings for us that we can expand our thinking around, across the company through the course of time. But it's early days now. We've been working to get the teams aligned and make sure that the team was confident there that we weren't coming in to change anything significantly in the business, and get them in part of the family. And that's really the - it\u2019s early days to draw in significant conclusions.\nDave Flitman: The only thing I'd add is that national joins a freely group of R&R businesses within the Builders FirstSource family already, TWParry, the Dixieline business, Pinar's business. We certainly have R&R exposure around the country. So really, we're to be able to learn from each other, right, share best practices, look for ways to grow and continue to make that an important part of our growth now.\nStanley Elliott: No. A good fit for sure. And then quickly on the - some of the Paradigm tests you guys are doing in South Carolina and other markets, to what extent are you guys pushing kind of this whole house take off like you've done or like you talked about at the Analyst Day, and what other products that you're trying to put into the kind of the systems here?\nPeter Jackson: Well, obviously, that's the vision, and that's where we're going. It's early days, and as I mentioned, a lot of heavy development we're going into to develop the theory of that case, and we're going to do it in pieces through the course of time. And that's really what the different pilots are aimed at - or developing those statements with customers and iterating our design and our thinking as we need to. So, certainly have not changed the focus on where we're heading. And we'll share more about our progress here as we make it.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nReuben Garner: Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the strong close to the year. Peter, you mentioned or you were discussing the 27% gross margin. Just a clarification about that. So, the - what mix are you assuming there? Is that 60:40 mix between the manufactured or value-added products and commodity? Or, I guess, just help me walk through that math. And maybe what's changed the most from the way you guys used to talk about gross margin a few years ago? Is it more mix driven? Is it synergies from the all the deals you've done? Is it just operational improvements, or is it a combination of all three?\nDave Flitman: Yes. The end of your second question, first, certainly a combination of all of them. On page five, you can see our base business product mix that you should think about in light of that 27%. And over time, that number associated with value-added product mix continues to increase. Certainly, we do well with specialty products as well, but that increase in value-added business the incremental margin that we're able to see in that part of the business because of the incremental value we're providing customers, that combines for us to give us confidence. But you're right. We are working on productivity. There are initiatives within our manufacturing facilities, discipline in pricing management, operations management, all the synergies we've seen from the combination of the businesses we purchased and, just in general, that growth of the business and improved leverage from our improved scale. So it is a combination, but that's a really positive thing, we think, for us being able to get more and more comfortable with that 27% plus normalized gross margin number on base business.\nReuben Garner: That's helpful. And then the - more of a longer-term strategic type question with the software play. So you guys have some expertise or some capabilities already in some of the categories in the house, windows, and doors or trusses or other manufactured products. But as you build out the software's capabilities to get into some other areas that you maybe don't participate in, say like, I don't know, paint, drywall, whatever they may be, do we - should we look for you guys to maybe build that out organically? Would that require future M&A? How do we think about longer term and how are you going to build that capability out?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I would say think about it in the context right now of us building this platform to sell more of our products to our existing customers and look for ways to add new customers. We talked at Investor Day about - and in other conversations about playing to our strengths around design capability, our vision around the whole house design and embedding our products in there. I think it's way too premature to talk about what other products might look like. Certainly, you've heard me say out loud, we don't need to back or integrate into other product categories at the moment. That's certainly not part of the vision today. It's hunkering down, building out the capability that aligns with our strengths today and getting more of them into our model. So\u2026\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG. Your line is open.\nRyan Gilbert: First question - the first question is just on - just the really strong growth you saw in single family core organic, up 14% against. Housing starts maybe, single family starts anyways, down 5% in the fourth quarter. Do you think that differential between the two represents maybe a lag between the single family starts growth that we saw earlier in 2021 and BLDR\u2019s revenue recognition? Or is that more a function of market share gains that you achieved in the quarter?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. No, that was a great question, Ryan. And then you've heard me talk about this before, in any given quarter, it's extremely difficult to align starts with sales and market share. But what I think you're seeing here is kind of what we committed to or what we told you was going to happen in past quarters. There have been periods where our growth looked like share declined. This is a period where it looks like a pretty healthy share expansion. I think if you look at it over time, we are continuing to take share in modest increments as we continue to deliver a superior product and partner with our customers. What you saw in this period, if I take you down to another layer of granularity is some rebounding in some of those windows, stores, and millwork categories, for example, where the supply free up a little bit. And the timing of the builds started to move through those components. Obviously, the fourth quarter is a big push point for many of the homebuilders just for them to do their completions so that they can get credit for the homes sold. So that's a lot of, I think, what you're seeing. It's just hard to in any given quarter sort of conclude on the numbers that you're winning or gaining. I think of winning or losing. But I think over the medium and long-term trend, we certainly feel good about our market share gains.\nDave Flitman: Yes. We are gaining share. Just to add to Peter's comment there, I would point not to the quarterly data, but if you look more broadly on what we did in 2021 with that 28% in single-family core organic growth versus roughly half that in terms of starts, I think that's a good judge. It gives us confidence that we are taking share in particular with the value-added components in millwork, which we're really pushing hard with our customers. So, we're seeing great adoption there as Peter commented earlier.\nRyan Gilbert: Second question is on the value-add product mix. It sounds like a lot of that's demand-driven, but maybe you can just give some broad brushes around what you're seeing on - in terms of I guess both value-add mix for revenue and value-add mix driving margin higher from just demand from your end markets versus your ability to drive more cross-selling volume with the - with BMC and BLDR combined?\nPeter Jackson: Well, I think it's a little bit of both. And we are very excited about the combination here. And as you might have heard us say in the past, even where we overlap in some of the major markets, the product capabilities were very complementary. Builders was legacy, Builders was much stronger in components more broadly across the country. BMC had a really good core strength around millwork. So, it's given us a nice opportunity here to add to the breadth of our offering for our customers. And I think that's also playing into our growth. Our customers aren\u2019t feeling the need to go elsewhere to get their product or their needs met because we've got such breadth and depth and capability across our portfolio. So - and then as we\u2019ve commented here, we are seeing increased adoption in all the areas of value-add. And it takes time, particularly as we've talked about in the south and east which were legacy state-framing markets. It's taken us a number of years to consistently get our customers and the framers comfortable with moving towards the value-added portions of the business. But what we found is we found in other markets is once you reached that tipping point, the adoption rates accelerate. That's certainly been what we've experienced.\nOperator: We have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to Mike Neese for any additional or closing remarks.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Britney. And thank you for your time today and for your interest in Builders FirstSource. Have a great day.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2021 was a phenomenal year for our company. We achieved four straight quarters of double digit core organic growth, delivering above market performance and record results. I want to thank our more than 28,000 team members for an incredible year. I'm extremely proud of their outstanding results, despite the many supply chain challenges and strong demand that is impacting our industry. I'll cover three key topics on today's call, which speak to the strength of our business and the strategy that is enabling us to excel as a leader in our space. First, I'll provide an update on our record full-year results, including our base business and our view of the current state of the housing market. Peter will discuss our fourth quarter results in his remarks. Second, I'll provide an update on our tuck-in acquisitions that continue to strengthen our industry-leading market position. And finally, I'll provide an update on our digital strategy, which we laid out during our Investor Day in December. As you know, we are the nation's leading supplier of structural building and value-added products and services, primarily to the residential construction market. We are a consolidator in our industry with arguably the best balance sheet of anyone in the space. We have a long track record of successful execution, combined with a very strong value proposition, a highly differentiated platform, and an unwavering commitment to customer-focused solutions. We are now 14 months into combining BFS and BMC with plenty of low-hanging fruit remaining for us to continue to harvest as we look to accelerate growth, capture synergies, and drive new productivity. Before I review our full-year results, I would like to highlight an important slide from our Investor Day. As we discussed during that event, we believe it is important to assess our results on a base business basis to better appreciate the underlying growth and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 3, over the next four years, we expect our base business to deliver a 10% CAGR on the top line, a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR and, importantly, a 50 basis points per year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points by 2025. Given the strength of our cash flow and the leverage target that we laid out last year between 1 and 2 times adjusted base business EBITDA, we expect to have $7 billion to $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025, and we will put that capital to work through continued investments in innovation and organic growth, accretive tuck-in M&A, and returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by the recent announcement of our third $1 billion share repurchase program in the last seven months. Turning to Slide 4. On a pro forma basis, we delivered an impressive single family core organic growth of approximately 28% in 2021. Meaningfully exceeding the single family starts growth of 13.6%. We produced record sales of nearly $20 billion to deliver $3.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. As you can see on Slide 5, our base business is strong as we grew sales by 26% to $15.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA by an outstanding 63%, while our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 250 basis points to 11.2%. Our momentum carried through the fourth quarter, in which we delivered $4.6 billion of revenue and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.1% on the strength of robust demand for housing, pricing discipline, and our continued focus on serving our customers with our value-added offerings. Last month, we attended the International Builders' Show in Orlando. Based on our conversations with many customers and suppliers, we believe demand for single family housing will remain strong headed into the spring homebuilding season. We are encouraged from these anecdotal conversations, but more importantly, by the double digit top line increases that we have seen in our results so far this year. The number of single family homes under construction increased 27% in 2021 versus 2020. One fact I'd like to remind you of is that there are currently more single-family homes under construction across the country than there have been in more than 14 years. And the homebuilder backlog is currently at the highest level it's been in the last 15 years. Backlogs, in fact, were an estimated 145,000 single-family units authorized, but not yet started as of last month, up 32% year-over-year, an encouraging sign of continued demand strength. On Slide 6, you will see that we also remain focused on executing our strategy of investing in inorganic growth. We have completed seven acquisitions for $1.2 billion since we closed on the BMC merger, and we believe we can invest at least $500 million each year in accretive M&A to augment our organic growth strategy. And as such, we will remain a disciplined consolidator in our industry for many years to come as we continue to focus on expanding an attractive high-growth markets and product categories. On December 31, we closed on our most recent acquisition of National Lumber, the largest independent building materials supplier in New England. National Lumber operates 16 facilities and employs more than 700 people across Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island with a diverse mix of products and end markets. This acquisition adds to our value-added portfolio and provides a favorable R&R mix in the New England area where we previously did not have a presence. We're excited to welcome the National Lumber team members to the Builders FirstSource family. Now, let me provide a brief update on our digital strategy on Slide 7. As a reminder, during our Investor Day, we provided an in-depth commentary on Paradigm and how they anchor our digital strategy. Our teams are working with our customers to pilot our technology, aiming to improve the pre-construction process, create more accurate material lists, bring our supply partners into a digital workflow and better engage homebuyers. We're actively pursuing several initiatives to advance our digital transformation. Among them, we continue to deploy paradigm estimate across more markets to accelerate customer quotations, and we are working on a specific pilot with a customer in South Carolina to improve our understanding of how to connect the home builders front-end sales process, utilizing paradigm visualization technology to enable a full band execution model and enhance home-building efficiency. We're making investments and executing projects that we believe will put us at the center of the homebuilding ecosystem. While these concepts may be basic, relative to other industries, they simply do not yet exist the scale in residential homebuilding. We believe we're on our path to revolutionize our industry for the benefit of our customers and to us, this represents an incremental $1 billion growth opportunity over the next five years. Next, on Slide 8, I'm pleased to announce that we've delivered $32 million in BMC merger-related cost synergies during the fourth quarter for a total of $108 million for the full year 2021, I can also announce that we have achieved a synergy run rate of $160 million as we exited 2021, well in excess of our $130 million to $150 million commitment at the announcement of the merger, and we captured those synergies two years faster than what we initially projected. I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome of our merger integration. With our merger-related synergy capture now officially completed, we have turned our attention to ramping up our internal productivity efforts. In 2022, we expect to capture total P&L productivity and synergy savings of $150 million, and we'll provide updates on our progress as the year proceeds. I believe great companies, and we are one, drive productivity on an ongoing basis and reinvest a portion of those savings to fuel future growth. We unveiled our BFS 1-TEAM operating system at our Investor Day, and the best way to think about that is continuous improvement in three key areas of our business. The first two are building people and building excellence. And as we do those two well, we will deliver the third, which is driving growth. Long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of the annual productivity improvement through our BFS 1-TEAM operating system. Looking at our progress as a combined company, we are clearly leveraging the strength of our industry-leading product portfolio, national network, and disciplined operating model alongside the robust demand environment to deliver exceptional growth, profitability, and free cash flow. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities to invest both organically and with M&A while returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. With a thoughtful and disciplined approach to deploying our capital, we are transforming the homebuilding industry through our investments in digital, expanding value-added offerings for our customers, and making strategic acquisitions that bolster and extend our industry leadership position. For 2022, we expect a continued strong execution by our team, combined with our diverse portfolio of value-added offerings, will enable us to deliver double-digit net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in our base business. Our team members continue to impress me at every turn from the sales forward to the yard and everywhere in between. Their commitment to excellence is where it keeps this company moving forward, and I love to highlight their collective and individual progress. For example, Alonzo Christian, the delivery manager at our Williamsburg, Virginia lumber location, gets his team started at 5:00 AM to ensure that Builders FirstSource trucks are the first out every morning to maximize seeing our customers each day. Not only does this give us a strategic advantage, but it shows our customers that BFS will be there for them when they need it, especially as they confront supply chain and labor challenges. With Alonzo's leadership, the yard runs efficiently and safely with no recordable injuries over the past five years, coupled with remarkably low-operating expenses and team member turnover. In total, we've made great progress in keeping our people safe. In the last year, we delivered an 18% reduction in recordable injuries across the company, beating our 10% reduction target, and we have another 10% improvement targeted for this year. It's a journey that never ends and we're getting better, but we're not going to stop. Our goal is zero. I'm grateful to team members like Alonzo who embody our core values, putting people first and showing our customers why BFS is the most valuable partner in the industry. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q4 results and provide an update on our new share repurchase program and our 2022 updated financial guidance. Thank you, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry is resilient, underbuilt, and we believe will continue to grow in 2022. As a result of the hard work of our team members every day, our company's momentum remains strong. We are leveraging our industry-leading platform to grow and sustain our profitability and will continue to benefit from our robust record free cash flow generation. We are poised to transform the homebuilding industry through our investments in value-added products and services and expanding our digital offerings. Our M&A pipeline remains strong and attractive, and we have the balance sheet to continue to execute on this important pillar of our strategy. We will remain disciplined in doing so. We are committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment and in our most recent $1 billion Committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment, and our most recent $1 billion share repurchase authorization is another indication of this commitment. We have a very clear and simple business strategy that our team is fully committed to implementing, and I've never been more excited about our potential in our future. Britney, let's please open the call for questions. Sure. Great question, Matt. We outlined a lot of this at our Investor Day, but as we anticipated and communicated in the Investor Day, we do anticipate the next year to 18 months to be heavily development-focused. So to your point, we are taking Estimate, Omni for homebuilders and building this transactional capability that we spoke about. Importantly, in terms of milestones, again, we're going to be headed down this year, pouring in a lot of energy around development. And I think, we spoke about one pilot that we have going on in South Carolina. There are several other pilots that we have going on testing various theories of our case and how we might put this platform together. And I just would expect that we will continue the share progress as we learn through those and certainly as we work towards the commercialization of the platform through the course of time. Yes, I would - this is Dave. I don't expect any change in our approach to capital allocation. We always have said and stated publicly that our first priority is to invest and grow organically inside our company. And as Peter just highlighted for you, we have great opportunities and have been doing that. Secondly, is finding the right accretive M&A to do and appoint for our $1.2 billion of spend in that area last year. And finally, where we have excess cash, we will return it to our shareholders. So, I don't expect any near-term shift in what we said are our priorities. Yes. I would just say that every one of the acquisitions that we did last year, we were excited about the day we announced them, and we're even more excited about them once we've got through the integration. Our most recent one, National Lumber, we've got a great team up there. Again, that's an area where we didn't have a footprint. As you know, not a tremendous region for starters, but they have an increased mix of R&R business and are the market leader across those three states. So consistent with how we've approached those acquisitions in times past, we're looking to augment our capability and our mix through value-added R&R and strengthen our footprint either in geographies where we do have a presence and are underrepresented in some of the value-added portions of the business or go in with scale into a market where we haven't been like you just saw us do in National - with National. And also s you saw us do with Alliance last summer in Arizona. Yes. I mean, we've seen continued trends consistent with what we've talked about as recently as Investor Day. Those labor challenges and supply chain challenges have not abated. There might be pockets of improvement in some product areas but, broadly, is still challenged. I think that's consistent with what you've heard on a recent homebuilder commentary. And again, our value-added component adoption in particular, is strong. We've been driving that trend for a number of years, and we've just continued to see that accelerate really broadly across all of our geographies as our customers have gotten more comfortable with the offerings, importantly, continue to fight those labor challenges, which we believe are going to persist for a long time to come. So, we see strong tailwind both in terms of demand as well as the adoption of the value-added portions of our business. Well, I think as you point out, Adam, I mean, we saw cycle times extend really going back to early days of the pandemic, given the ramp up in the demand and the supply chain challenges, which kind of overlaid with that. We really haven't seen that abate significantly through the course of time here. And importantly, I think, even if we were going to see some improvement on the supply chain side, what happened when Omicron hit was we saw a lot of our suppliers face those challenges late last year, and in particular in January of this year. And we're just unable really to catch up on the backlog. So, we really haven't seen any abatement of the supply chain challenges broadly. Like I said earlier, maybe a few pockets of improvement, but things are kind of status quo on that front from our view. That was overall across our business. But importantly, we're talking about kind of organic volume growth across the company here in the first couple of months. And just my comments earlier weren't aimed at any particular product category. We have seen a little abatement in a few. I might mention interior doors, but exteriors are still very tight, so it really varies. Windows might be incrementally better on lead times than they were six months ago, but they're still double-digit weeks kind of lead time. So, that's my point. Incremental improvement but not any major relief broadly across the supply chain, Steven, is what I point to. Yes. I would say obviously we've been talking about affordability challenges for quite some time. I would characterize our confidence around two things. First of all, a lot of in-depth conversations with our customers and suppliers as we've talked about the strength of the backlog, which I commented on. And importantly, two underlying fundamentals here that are probably much different than in times past. First is just the demand strength that we've seen over the last several years. We're talking about millennials who's driving the home buying, particularly the first time buyer or this first time step-up buyer. That dynamic has not changed. And secondly and importantly, and we've talked about this at length, the huge overbuilding that's occurred in this industry over the last decade and overlaid with that strong demand. We have a lot of confidence that that will continue to drive growth not only this year, but for a long time to come. At some point, the interest rates could become a factor. We're certainly not hearing that at current levels from our customers today. Yes. So, on the base business side, it's consistent, right, with the overall growth. You're right about the costs getting more difficult, right? And we had a pretty nice stretch there of solid double-digit percentage growth. We think that will slow this year, obviously. But I think as you look at the actions being taken in the market, we hope to see or we expect to see incremental, as Dave mentioned, over time, relief on supply chain side. And we think that'll roll out of the market to continue to accelerate. Again, that demand, for a variety of reasons, we think is very, very healthy. So there's room for growth, both from orders already taken but we think from customers eager to get in as well. I think it's more of the latter. We saw growth all year. We'll need to continue to see incremental as the year goes on. We think that will be supported with that relief on the supply chain side. So, well, a couple of comments. First of all, you're right. It was pretty dynamic, right? We had talked openly about how we felt like it was important to use $400 as our long-term average We're at about the 10-year average for commodity prices. And I think it's fair to say that I took a little grief over putting that number out there, but we kind of saw that number in September. So, a lot of volatility last year to go to 1,600 to 400 million back to 1,300 plus right now. A lot of that flow through in terms of volatility in the fourth quarter. The fall and when the products came through, then the run, and when we started to see the impacts on working capital in sales, that's a big piece. Those are always tricky to guide you on and to give you some good tools. It's the turn that's always the most difficult part model, as you know. What we expect to happen is sort of consistent and then we will continue to focus on passing through cost pricing on replacement, staying disciplined about what we have availability on and being careful to support customers and be clear and candid with them about what they can get and what they can't and why but are disciplined around pricing, around inventory purchases and around inventory management. And on the ground days, it continues and we will continue to invest in it over time. I think that to reiterate something that maybe I - maybe you heard me say in the past, we do think there is a moderation on the amount of gross margin tailwind and headwind versus who we have been in past the year. We think as prices inflate and deflate as they do in commodities, we are seeing less of an expansion and contraction in our gross margins than we have historically. The only thing I'd add is that national joins a freely group of R&R businesses within the Builders FirstSource family already, TWParry, the Dixieline business, Pinar's business. We certainly have R&R exposure around the country. So really, we're to be able to learn from each other, right, share best practices, look for ways to grow and continue to make that an important part of our growth now. Yes. The end of your second question, first, certainly a combination of all of them. On page five, you can see our base business product mix that you should think about in light of that 27%. And over time, that number associated with value-added product mix continues to increase. Certainly, we do well with specialty products as well, but that increase in value-added business the incremental margin that we're able to see in that part of the business because of the incremental value we're providing customers, that combines for us to give us confidence. But you're right. We are working on productivity. There are initiatives within our manufacturing facilities, discipline in pricing management, operations management, all the synergies we've seen from the combination of the businesses we purchased and, just in general, that growth of the business and improved leverage from our improved scale. So it is a combination, but that's a really positive thing, we think, for us being able to get more and more comfortable with that 27% plus normalized gross margin number on base business. Yes. We are gaining share. Just to add to Peter's comment there, I would point not to the quarterly data, but if you look more broadly on what we did in 2021 with that 28% in single-family core organic growth versus roughly half that in terms of starts, I think that's a good judge. It gives us confidence that we are taking share in particular with the value-added components in millwork, which we're really pushing hard with our customers. So, we're seeing great adoption there as Peter commented earlier."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I want to add my thanks to our team members for delivering an outstanding and record 2021. We wouldn't have been able to deliver such fantastic results without your hard work, your dedication, and your focus on our customers. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our fourth quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior-year quarter. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment. And third, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full-year 2022. Let's begin with our Q4 performance on Slide 9. We had net sales of $4.6 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 24% compared to the combined pro forma prior-year period. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 28%, highlighting our work to meet the strong demand across our value-added channels, especially impressive given the continued supply chain constraints. Despite the price volatility, commodity price inflation benefited net sales by 5% and acquisitions contributed another 7%. Gross profit was $1.5 billion, an increase of 52% compared with the combined pro forma prior year period. Gross margin increased 610 basis points to 32.1%, driven mainly by cost increases coupled with disciplined pricing, as well as effective and timely sourcing in a volatile, supply constrained marketplace. For the full year, our gross margin increased 360 basis points to 29.4%. Following this recent performance and our increasing mix of value-added products, we believe our normalized gross margins will now be approximately 27% or better compared to our prior expectation of 26.5%, a 50 basis point increase. For the quarter, SG&A was $864 million, an increase of approximately $189 million or 28% compared to the combined pro-forma prior-year period, driven primarily by expense related to the BMC merger and other acquisitions, including amortization expense of acquired intangibles and onetime charges. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 60 basis points to 18.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 110% to $793.4 million, driven by solid demand across our key customer end markets, combined with disciplined pricing on increasing costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 17.1%, which increased 700 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro-forma period. In the fourth quarter, net income was $442.5 million or $2.31 per share compared to combined pro forma net income of $200.7 million or $0.96 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $532.4 million or $2.78 of adjusted EPS. This compares to a combined pro forma adjusted net income of $225.5 million or $1.08 of adjusted EPS in the prior-year period. The 136.1% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income tax and SG&A expense. The 157.4% increase in adjusted EPS is driven by the increase in adjusted net income coupled with our reduced share count, which I'll cover in a moment. Now, let's turn to cash flow. Our fourth quarter operating cash flow was approximately $840 million, driven by increased net sales and the impact of inflation. Free cash flow was $774 million during the quarter. Turning to Slide 12, for 2021, our full year free cash was an inflow of $1.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of commodity inflation and core organic growth. The free cash flow for 2021 was a bit lower than our forecasted guide as a result of higher than expected sales driving an increase in year-end working capital due in large part to rising commodity prices later in the year. Let's turn to our capital deployment. For the full year of 2021, our M&A bolt-on strategy resulted in our purchasing seven companies for approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 16.5 million shares of BFS common stock at an average price of $70.89 for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in August of 2021, we have repurchased 30.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $2 billion for an average price of $65.43 per share. That's more than 15% of our shares outstanding while maintaining a rock solid balance sheet. We have completed the share repurchase programs authorized in August and November of 2021. In February 2022, the board then authorized another $1 billion share repurchase program. As we mentioned during the Investor Day, we plan to deploy $5 billion to $7 billion of capital by 2025. Of the $3 billion of share repurchase authorizations announced today, $2 million pass towards our target. We accelerated $700 million of the second-billion authorization at the end of 2021 and finished the remaining $300 million in January. As you may have seen, last month, we completed a private offering of an additional $300 million of our 2032 notes at an issue price equal to 105% of our value. Net proceeds from the offerings were used to repay borrowings on the 2026 ABL facility. In addition, the company amended the 2026 facility to increase the total commitments by an aggregate amount of $400 million, resulting in a new $1.8 billion amended credit facility. Also on Slide 12, our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.7 times our base business EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long term debt maturities until 2027, and our total liquidity was over $700 million as of year-end, consisting of about $686 million in net borrowing availability and $43 million in cash. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results were tremendous. The merger of BFS and BMC has gone better than expected, the combined field sales team is driving higher margin products and delivering value to our customers, and our balance sheet is strong. Let's change gears and discuss our 2022 full year outlook on Slide 13. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. We are estimating single family starts growth across our geographies in the middle single digits. R&R and Multi Family growth in the low-to-mid-single digits. Going forward, we are going to provide you with our base business guide on net sales and EBITDA as we believe this is a better measurement of our performance and assumes constant commodity costs at $400 per thousand. We'll continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. We expect base business net sales to grow approximately 8% to 12% over 2021 net sales of $15.7 billion. We expect base business adjusted EBITDA to grow 12% to 18% over 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion. The growth in these metrics is consistent with the long-term plan we communicated our December 7 Investor Day. CapEx is projected to be approximately $400 million in 2022. The increase from prior year is due to adding capacity in several of our facilities, largely related to value-added growth initiatives that will drive higher-margin results. In 2022, we expect productivity gains will contribute another $150 million to EBITDA, of which $50 million will come from the realization of BMC synergies. We believe free cash flow will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion, assuming an average commodity price in the range of $600 to $1,000 for the year. This assumes working capital coming down due to lower commodity prices in the back half of 2022. On Slide 14, we provide the sensitivity chart I mentioned, providing a way to think about our total sales and total adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 at various static commodity price points. It's important to note that our base business outlook is the same under any of these commodity assumptions. While we are not providing explicit guidance for total sales in total adjusted EBITDA, we believe this table is helpful in understanding the relationship between expected base commodity performance and total results under various commodity assumptions. We believe 2022 will be another strong year of growing our value-added products and profitability, outperforming the market, introducing innovative technology, and driving operational excellence across our geographic footprint. I'm proud of our 2021 performance and excited for what is in store for 2022. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Yes. Thanks, Matt. That's a great question. I think you hit the nail on the head with your initial comments. The focus is really around value add. And what you're seeing here is that the same fleet size of the company having grown substantially as well as the acceleration we're trying to invest in. So this is new facilities. We have a number of those and we'll continue to talk about them. This is new lines within existing facilities. It's new equipment within existing lines, in existing facilities, and as well as the maintenance and the core of the operation rights. We're talking about fleet and force and all the different markets and things that we would need throughout the business. A little bit of inflation in there, but the bulk of it is core, the core maintenance and a substantial increase on that value add - value add side of the business. We're seeing a ton of demand. We're certainly seeing capacity particularly in hot markets be used up very, very quickly. And we're trying to make sure we stay on our front foot and stay aggressive given our cash flow and what we're able to do with it. Sure. Yes. I mean, to talk to the basics, we are expecting to continue to see good growth. You know we have to give you a commodity range in order to make the cash flow work. Right? It's not a base business metric. Cash flow isn't leased. So we did give you a midpoint. Your guess is as good or better than mine in terms of what commodities will be. Our job is to make sure we continue to deliver on profitable business related to it. But the overall growth - you saw top line in the base business being a midpoint of 10% in line with what we did, too, in Investor Day. Again the EBITDA growing midpoint of that 15% in line with what we said on Investor Day. In that fall through, we think we'll continue to work in line with our discipline around working capital. And what we've seen is it's still a healthy market, while there is certainly a lack of availability and supply in certain key areas. We are managing both our air and inventory very well, and I think the balance of our working capital is still healthy, so that combination, along with the other components which we have here in terms of the inputs on the cash flow are pretty much in line with prior year. And we think that certainly supports our commentary around the strong cash flow that we have seen and we expect to continue to see from this business in the coming years and kind of circles back to that Investor Day commentaries. We think by 2025, we're going to be deploying between $7 billion and $10 billion of cash, this is one installment of that cash. Well, I mean, we've certainly seen strong margins over the last year. There has been a lot of work as we've described in the past that improving our management of price, we've seen a tremendous amount of movement on the cost side and trying to stay very disciplined in their pass-through disciplines around that as well. As you look at both 2021 and 2022, we do believe there was some improvement in price. We haven't given the split historically. We probably won't do that for the foreseeable future, but certainly seeing both of those as being tailwinds for us in both 20221 and 2022. Yes, Trey. This is Peter. So, my goal there was to give you guys a range of our outcomes. I think we all understand the volatility of some of that inputs this year. We've certainly got a few curveballs thrown at us already in 2022. I - what I will tell you as we build out our plans and look at the materials that the field is prepared in conjunction with their conversations with customers with our plans for new facilities, for productivity, for all the initiatives we're managing internally. We are really on that midpoint. That's where we think it'll be. Now, certainly, the potential for movements up and down and the supply chain availability movements up and down to starts that we think that will influence within supply chain is really the biggest limiting factor today. External factors, probably not as big of a deal, I don't think we're seeing a lot of risk associated with anything to do with what's going on in Europe and Ukraine right now. I think most of what we're looking at is the work around clearing those supply chain backlogs and continuing to get labor into job sites or at least into manufacturing facilities that need those job sites to make sure we're keeping the process flowing. But those are the big variables. Yes. So geographically speaking, I think it's a little bit predictable. Where we're putting new capacity is where there is a lot of growth. The smile phase or the banana phase, whatever descriptor you choose, those southern and coastal stars-focused communities is where we're particularly strong and certainly seeing, over time, an increased adoption of that manufactured product offering whereas, historically, maybe it wasn't as concentrated as northern state. So a lot of focus definitely in value add. And in those states, I don't think there's much in the way of catch-up. Off at the top of my head, I can't think of anything that we've deferred at all. It's somewhat to do maybe catchup if you want to attribute it to supply chain and availability issues. We've seen a little bit of improved relief in some of those categories. Again, not as much as we'd like but, as Dave mentioned, incremental improvement. So, we did exclude - well, because the business wasn't owned, we do not have anything included. We didn't go back into the prior periods and pull it out. It's actuals. To that end, what we purchased the component of the year is included, so you'll get the lapping effect of the 2022 or on 2022 for both of those. They include closed acquisitions. Right? So, we, of course, are continuing as we described to pursue M&A opportunities, but we don't have any forecast in there in 2022 for what incremental ones, just what we've already closed as of year-end. So, including national, but nothing beyond that. Yes - no, that's a great question. And I think our goal of here is to be very, very static in all of the commentary we're making about commodities. Everything based assumes $400 for every period, for every year always. We'll let you know of that $400. We think it's appropriate to change that $400 at some point, but for the time being, $400 is the number and applies equally to all those periods. So, why \u2013it's why I've used the phrase static a few times, because as we all know, commodities is - if it's one thing, it's not static. But in order to give you a nice clean comparison to help you understand the core of the business, that base business metric, that's why we use that. So our number, if you want to think about it this way for cash, assumes that $600 to $1,000, that's an average. It's an average for the year, and it would assume that we would be in the midpoint of that in order to generate that kind of cash flow. And so, if you're thinking about the sensitivity page, we'd like you to think about your average for the year, sort not just emulate or replicate a static commodity number for the year. Does that help? We don't break it out at that manufacture product level in terms of specific guide, but you're right. It is growing faster. I think that really what you're seeing now, Keith, is the next leg of the growth that we've been hoping for, and that's the expansion of the utilization of those manufactured products into markets that historically haven't adopted it. Some of the southern markets where you have not seen the adoption of manufactured products because there was a substantial amount of available framing labor, and it was relatively cheap. The nature of the speed of the recovery and how aggressive homebuilders are being trying to get homes built, trying to compensate for the extended build cycles is really, really common to fruit on the tree of manufactured products. We are seeing rapid growth there. We talk about manufacturing - or how value add was up 28%, high 20s across the board for 2021. Those are heady numbers, but we think we can continue to see growth. The challenge for us is we sort of harvested the second shift stop, now you're talking about really putting to work the numbers that we're investing in, that real new capacity. We feel good about it. We have a great track record of doing it, and we expect it will continue to grow those strong double digits definitely better than the rest of the business throughout 2022. Yes. So, let me draw a distinction that that normalized is ignoring anything unusual or outside of the base business metric for commodity prices. So, just to say right, this is at normal banks at normal prices, we think we're at 27%. There is another layer that I'm sure you appreciate. I think we are seeing unusual margins based on the supply chain issues that we're experiencing right now. I don't want to give anybody the impression that 29%, 32% margins or the reduced margins if you exclude the commodity component and just look at phase that those are normal. We think we're in a bit of a displaced time right now. We think over time, things will refer back to a normalized gross margins of around 27% or better. Obviously, we're doing our best to manage that carefully, to improve our productivity, to add overall performance to those gross margin numbers. But we're trying to give people an insight that as we've seen that value add grow and as we've seen our business stabilize around the country, we feel very good about our ability to revalue for what we're providing and to partner with customers. And we think 27% gross margin is a better basis. We've certainly seen strong performance both in the fourth quarter and into Q1. I think that's been pretty consistent, even though we're laughing more difficult comps on the revenue line. Well, it's early days and obviously, more color to come on that. We've got them for - right at two months. We got a company full of great people that have a very strong market position, and that's more an R&R market up there. So, what we are learning is the product portfolio that they have, the growth that they've developed consistently over time aimed at R&R. I'm sure there'll be significant learnings for us that we can expand our thinking around, across the company through the course of time. But it's early days now. We've been working to get the teams aligned and make sure that the team was confident there that we weren't coming in to change anything significantly in the business, and get them in part of the family. And that's really the - it's early days to draw in significant conclusions. Well, obviously, that's the vision, and that's where we're going. It's early days, and as I mentioned, a lot of heavy development we're going into to develop the theory of that case, and we're going to do it in pieces through the course of time. And that's really what the different pilots are aimed at - or developing those statements with customers and iterating our design and our thinking as we need to. So, certainly have not changed the focus on where we're heading. And we'll share more about our progress here as we make it. Yes. I would say think about it in the context right now of us building this platform to sell more of our products to our existing customers and look for ways to add new customers. We talked at Investor Day about - and in other conversations about playing to our strengths around design capability, our vision around the whole house design and embedding our products in there. I think it's way too premature to talk about what other products might look like. Certainly, you've heard me say out loud, we don't need to back or integrate into other product categories at the moment. That's certainly not part of the vision today. It's hunkering down, building out the capability that aligns with our strengths today and getting more of them into our model. So... Yes. No, that was a great question, Ryan. And then you've heard me talk about this before, in any given quarter, it's extremely difficult to align starts with sales and market share. But what I think you're seeing here is kind of what we committed to or what we told you was going to happen in past quarters. There have been periods where our growth looked like share declined. This is a period where it looks like a pretty healthy share expansion. I think if you look at it over time, we are continuing to take share in modest increments as we continue to deliver a superior product and partner with our customers. What you saw in this period, if I take you down to another layer of granularity is some rebounding in some of those windows, stores, and millwork categories, for example, where the supply free up a little bit. And the timing of the builds started to move through those components. Obviously, the fourth quarter is a big push point for many of the homebuilders just for them to do their completions so that they can get credit for the homes sold. So that's a lot of, I think, what you're seeing. It's just hard to in any given quarter sort of conclude on the numbers that you're winning or gaining. I think of winning or losing. But I think over the medium and long-term trend, we certainly feel good about our market share gains. Well, I think it's a little bit of both. And we are very excited about the combination here. And as you might have heard us say in the past, even where we overlap in some of the major markets, the product capabilities were very complementary. Builders was legacy, Builders was much stronger in components more broadly across the country. BMC had a really good core strength around millwork. So, it's given us a nice opportunity here to add to the breadth of our offering for our customers. And I think that's also playing into our growth. Our customers aren't feeling the need to go elsewhere to get their product or their needs met because we've got such breadth and depth and capability across our portfolio. So - and then as we've commented here, we are seeing increased adoption in all the areas of value-add. And it takes time, particularly as we've talked about in the south and east which were legacy state-framing markets. It's taken us a number of years to consistently get our customers and the framers comfortable with moving towards the value-added portions of the business. But what we found is we found in other markets is once you reached that tipping point, the adoption rates accelerate. That's certainly been what we've experienced."

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Builders FirstSource management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Leo. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I hope you and your families continue to remain safe and well. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today we will review our record third quarter results, discuss our ongoing integration progress and achievements and cover our recent M&A activity. We remain bullish on the housing sector and believe we are well positioned for continued profitable growth in a highly fragment - fragmented market. We provided results that include BMC in the third quarter of 2021 and standalone BFS in the third quarter of 2020. We have also provided pro forma results as if we own BMC in the third quarter of 2020. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. The third quarter press release and supporting presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results, adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should not be considered in isolation from the most direct comparable GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they are useful to investors can be found in the earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press in - the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigations Reform Act and projections of future results, Please review the forward-looking statement section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. I'll cover three key topics on today's call. First I'll provide a quick update on our record third quarter results, including our base business and our view of the current state of the housing market. Second, I'll provide an update on our recent tuck-in acquisitions that further strengthened our leading market position. And finally, I'll provide an update on the BMC integration, which is progressing exceptionally well and continues to track ahead of plan. As you can see on Slide 3, in the third quarter, our team delivered exceptional performance continue to produce core organic growth, expanded margins and delivered strong cash flow. Sales grew an impressive 63% to $5.5 billion. Embedded in our top line performance, we also delivered core organic growth of 16.1%. Gross profit expanded 103% to a new quarterly record. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled when compared to the prior year quarter to a record $976 million with adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 930 basis points to a record 17.7%. Finally, the increase of our EBITDA and margins helped us deliver approximately $1.1 billion in free cash flow while repurchasing 5.3% of our outstanding common shares. This strong performance underscores the strength of our industry-leading platform in the tremendous execution by our team members as we continue to outperform in our markets despite the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the homebuilding industry. Last quarter, in an effort to provide greater transparency into our underlying business performance, we provided an overview of the top and bottom line growth of our base business. As shown on Slide 6 for the full year of 2021, we now expect our base business net sales to grow to $15.7 billion from $12.5 billion or 26% and adjusted EBITDA to grow to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion or 64%. Over time, we believe our base business will sustain and grow our double-digit EBITDA margin and expect to deliver 11.2% EBITDA margin for the full year 2021. Demand for single-family housing continues to support our top line growth and we believe that growth will be sustained over time as demographics, continue to develop favorably coupled with more than a decade of under. For the quarter on a pro forma basis, our core organic customer growth was 27.5% for single family. Value added core organic sales grew by an estimated 31.2% led by 44.6% growth in our manufactured product category. Our team members are doing an outstanding job getting our customers what they need in a very challenging environment. Single family starts to increase to approximately 5% in the third quarter on tough comparisons to a strong prior-year period. However, we were encouraged to see our core organic growth remains strong as underlying demand leveled off during the quarter. In addition, looking beyond the effects of the pandemic in the third quarter of last year, single family starts this quarter grew 21% when compared with the third quarter of 2019, which are core organic growth outpaced by 650 basis points. The country has averaged 1.2 million units of existing inventory in 2021 which is 14% below the 5-year average and a roughly a third of historical highs. Single-family housing under construction also increased 31% in the third quarter. In fact, there are currently more single-family homes under construction across the country than they have been in more than 14 years and our homebuilder backlog is currently at the highest level it has been in the last 15 years. This data is an encouraging sign for our business as we finish 2021 and look to next year, and we expect demand to remain robust. On Slide 7, we are focused on executing our strategy of investing in growth. We have completed five sucking transactions in 2021 since merging with BMC and believe each acquisition as unique value to not only our portfolio of best in class solutions for customers, but also our geographic presence in attractive economically sound high growth markets. Turning to Slide 8, we were excited to welcome the California TrusFrame team to the Builders FirstSource family in the third quarter. CaliTrus was California's largest independent truss manufacturer and has added substantial and profitable scale through our value-added products business on the West Coast. This acquisition adds for our value-added portfolio and provide access to new customers for our continued growth. Also during the quarter, we acquired the Apollo software assets from former construction technology startup Katerra. The Apollo platform provides design collaboration and workflow, construction budgeting and scheduling and job site management capabilities combined with mobile functionality. A quick update on our Paradigm acquisition. The BFS and Paradigm teams have come together nicely and are aligning on our digital strategy to drive efficiency and residential construction which will create value for our homebuilder customers and revenue growth for us. Our teams have made a number of customer business which have helped us validate the market opportunity associated with developing an end to end digital solution. And we are now working with several customers on pilots that will improve the preconstruction process, create more accurate material lists, bring our supply partners into a digital workflow and better engage home buyers in the process. We remain confident in our investments in both Paradigm and Apollo and our ability to drive long-term value through digital transformation. Moving forward, we will continue to reinvest in our business to accelerate organic growth while actively pursuing accretive tuck-in M&A opportunities to improve our mix and build scale in key growth markets. We firmly believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation will allow us to remain a disciplined consolidator in this industry. Next. On Slide 10. I'll provide a brief update on the BMC integration. As reported last quarter, synergies are tracking one full year ahead of our plan and are projected to be in the range of $140 million to$160 million by the end of 2022 exceeding our initial expectations. We delivered $36 million in cost synergies in the third quarter and $74 million during the first nine months of 2021. We now expect 2021 cost synergies to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million and mid-point increase of $10 million above the expected outcome we reported in the second quarter. Our ability to achieve our synergy commitment in half the time underscores the cultural alignment of our two companies and the strength in collaboration of our leadership team. As we approach Veteran's Day, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank the veterans at BFS and their families. Earlier this fall. I had the honor of signing a statement of support on behalf of our company with the employer support of the Guard and Reserve or the ESGR, I had the privilege of meeting BFS team member and US Army veteran Corey Basinger. Corey spent 8 years in the Army and has been with BFS nearly 10 years. He is our maintenance manager in Houston, where he oversees critical facilities and equipment processes so we can seamlessly serve our customers. Corey receive the Pro Patria and above and beyond awards for his excellent leadership and supporting Guard and Reserve employees, in part due to do to his empathy, experience and understanding of what it means to be a veteran. Thank you. Cory, and thank you to all of our veterans for your service. With that let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q3 results and provide an update on our share repurchase program and our 2021 updated financial guidance.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. I want to thank all of our team members for delivering another incredible quarter. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our third quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior year quarter. Second, I'll update you on how we are deploying capital supported by strong operating cash flow. And third, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full year of 2021. Let's start with our Q3 results, we had net sales of $5.5 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 63% compared to the combined pro forma prior-year period. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 31.2% led by 44.6% growth in our manufactured products category. Robust in internationally continues to be constrained by supply chain challenge. Commodity price inflation benefited sales by 39% and acquisitions contributed another 8%. Gross profit was $1.7 billion, an increase of $868 million or 103% compared with the combined pro forma prior-year period. Our gross margin increased 620 basis points to 31.1% primarily driven by disciplined pricing in a volatile supply constrained marketplace along with effective and timely source. Based on our year-to-date experience with the combined entity, we now believe our normalized gross margins will be north of 26.5%. SG&A was $875 million, an increase of approximately $235 million or 36.7% compared to the combined pro forma prior-year period. This was driven primarily by expense related to the BMC merger and other acquisitions including amortization expense of acquired intangibles and one-time charges. Excluding acquisition related one-time charges and variable compensation, underlying SG&A increased 8.1%. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 300 basis points to 15.9% due to the impact of higher net sales and continued expense control, which more than offset higher variable compensation driven by the increase in net sales and profitability. Adjusted EBITDA increased 244.4% to $975.9 million driven by consistently strong single family home demand, commodity inflation, execution of merger related synergies and cost leverage. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 17.7%, an increase of 930 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro forma period. In Q3 adjusted diluted EPS was $3.39 compared to a combined pro forma of $0.74 in the prior year period. The more than 3-fold increase was primarily driven by the growth in operating income, partly offset by higher taxes. Now let's turn to cash flow, our third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion, driven by increased net sales and disciplined working capital management. Free cash flow was also a robust $1.1 billion during the quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $11 million shares or 5.3% of our common shares outstanding at an average price of $52.74 for a total cost of $578 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $422 million remaining under our existing $1 billion share repurchase authorization. In October, we repurchased an additional $4.5 million shares at an average price of $55.99, leaving approximately $172 million in our current authorization. On Slide 11 our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1 times our base business. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2027 and our total liquidity was roughly $1.5 billion consisting of about $1.3 billion of net borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility and $225 million in cash. Our strong third quarter and first nine months performance is a testament to our field teams who are delivering excellent value to our customers. We will continue to focus on growing the higher margin specialty and value-added products and services in our portfolio. And now let's discuss our 2021 full-year outlook, which we are revising upward and can be found on Slide 12. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. Based on our first nine months results, we are increasing our full year '21 outlook. Net sales is expected to grow to a range of $19.3 billion to $19.8 billion or approximately 51% to 55 over 2020 combined proforma net sales of $12.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $2.95 billion or approximately 166% to 176% of our 2020 combined proforma adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. In 2021, we expect BMC synergy savings of $90 million to $110 million to be recognized in the P & L. Free cash flow will be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. A decrease of $400 as the expected increase in EBITDA will be partially offset by higher cash tax. Our outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release including mid teen percentage growth and single family starts, R&R growth in the low single digits and multi-family starts growth in the high single digits. Overall, we are having a tremendous year. Our base business is robust and growing and we believe there is a long runway for growth into 2022 and beyond. We are focused on creating value for our stakeholders and are continuing to build our world-class distribution network founded on operational excellence and delivering exceptional value to our customers. Let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Flitman: Thanks, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry momentum continues to be strong. Our core organic growth and in particular our value-added product categories is outpacing the industry in this unprecedented time given rapid growth in demand and widespread supply challenges. Our base business is large and we believe it will grow in 2022, the BMC integration and cost synergies are well ahead of schedule and the implementation of our digital strategy is ramping up. Our team is focused on operational excellence in delivering exceptional results for our customers and for our shareholders. I'm confident that our differentiated platform and our ability to invest organically and through M&A will deliver above market profitability and generate significant free cash flow for many years to come. Finally, we are excited to host our first ever Investor Day on December 7 and hope to see many of you here in the Dallas area. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take a question from Matthew Bouley of Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatthew Bouley: Many areas to touch on here, I guess I'll start with the gross margin. You - Peter, you said the normalized gross margin, you can now commit to north of 26.5. I obviously have to ask the question of how far north are we talking if you have any elaboration on that and maybe within that it would just be helpful if you could describe with this quarter's 31%, how much of that might have been driven by commodity deflation. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. Thank you. The gross margin numbers we're seeing now are really encouraging from our perspective, because it underscores the strength of the product portfolio the way we're combining the sales of value add with the other products. Certainly the tailwinds from commodities have been welcomed and I think we've done a nice job of generating real profitability and cash flow from it. There is also a little bit of unusual in this quarter and everybody is talking about it obviously given the supply chain constraints. That's caused some unusual numbers and some unusual dynamics based on timing and the price increases and things of that nature. So we can think it's a little bit unusual, certainly a significant portion of that gross margin fall through that comes from the benefit on commodities. And so the 26.5% is where based on what we've seen in the nine months combined in the company, we feel very good about. I think we sort of demonstrated a willingness to commit to things that we know we're confident in. I mean, we are very confident in that 26.5% or better. We're certainly thinking about it in context of the longer-range of the business. It was a more long-term normal where we think we can get to and we'll be talking a lot more about that in our Investor.\nDave Flitman: And then I would just add that we have re-companies in our ability to outpace the market and continue that in our value-added portions of the business, which is also helping to shift the mix of the company. As you saw the strong performance in manufactured products. We also had core organic growth above our average in our millwork, doors and windows business which has continued to strengthen throughout the year despite all the supply chain challenges with that.\nMatthew Bouley: That's great color. Thank you both for that. Second one on capital deployment clearly great progress on deploying the balance sheet there with the buyback just in the past 3 months. So I think you're still guiding to over $1 billion of free cash flow just in Q4. Any thoughts on kind of a future buyback authorization and Dave, you also mentioned that just being a disciplined consolidator in M&A, there's other consolidators out there, I'm just curious if you can kind of outline what you're seeing in the M&A market from a competitive perspective and valuations and all that. So thank you both and congrats on the results.\nDave Flitman: Yes, thank you. So with regard to the share buyback. To date, we're very, very pleased with what we've been able to accomplish. We think we were able to move, put a lot of capital toward this quarter added on an underpriced stock, and I think we're doing pretty well there. Certainly happy with the momentum. We do have remaining allocation. So we've all been authorized for another roughly $175 million. That is going to be our first priority. No new announcement today or anything into the future, but obviously we sort of demonstrated the way we think about the business and how we're going to work in terms of a balanced capital allocation.\nPeter Jackson: The second part of your question there on M&A, we have been disciplined in our work both us in place. the companies have. As you probably expect there's been a lot of opportunities in the market through the course of this year. Valuations have. We've been disciplined around how we think about the long-term profitability of our targets, especially given the lumber environment that we've have here. We can get the deals that we want and we're going to stay disciplined around that. The five deals that we've done this year we feel very good about. And so we didn't say a lot about the pipeline slide in the deck, but it's still very strong and robust. And we're going to continue to play out our M&A in a way that makes sense for the company.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Congrats on your results, really exceptional I. A couple of questions around the value add. The first one really manufactured products another really strong quarter, your other value add categories up nicely as well but lot of strength in Manufactured Products combination of a lot of hard work on positioning that business, can you remind us where you're at now from a capacity standpoint and potentially speak to how you're thinking about incremental investments and further capacity expansions there.\nDave Flitman: Yes, I'll start and then Peter down any color on it, but we continue to see very high demand in manufacturing performance. It's really not just in one geography, it's all across the country. And as we said when we combine these two companies, the complementary nature of our value-added capabilities was going to be very powerful and we certainly see that - see that play out exactly as we expect. I would tell you right now, we haven't more demand than we have capacity for our products and we expect that's going to continue. We have moved the market this direction and the labor challenges, the - the performance around inflation is real. Our customers are all talking about it, we've seen it every day and that's helped us continue to move the market towards offsite manufacturing and helping them be a lot more efficient at the job site. \\We have invested heavily in that part of the business and we will continue to do so to make sure we're meeting demand.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah, you see that point, we have a number of projects around the country where we have seen the utilization of our existing capacity to expand it. We can do that in a number of ways. The easiest way is obviously adding shifts, next would be adding equipment, automation equipment more sophisticated equipment, more equipment in total. Some limitations in that right now, just given the supply chains and availability of the wrong funds further up the supply chain and in greenfield along the line in greenfield, we know there are markets around the country that's been adopting this type of solution, this value-added solution, very, very quickly and we see tremendous opportunities in expanding our footprint, being the provider of choice and the provider with the best sort of variable cost position as we execute that as well to be successful long term.\nMike Dahl: And my second question, obviously the scale, the execution, the way you positioned the business has helped you to capture a decent amount of share in a very dynamic and supply constrained environment and it's demonstrated the potential power and profitability of the business. As you look forward, there is probably a world in which when things normalize, some of your maybe smaller mom and pop competitors are, get back on their feet and I guess the question is really, when you think about customer stickiness and share the stickiness in share gains, how does your experience this year affect how you think about balancing share versus price and margin in a more normal environment and maybe if that differs when you think about commodity versus value add.\nPeter Jackson: Well, certainly on the value-added portions of the business, we continue to see great adoption. We expect that that will continue. However, we have to remain competitive and to your point around that, this is still a very competitive market. We have seen as we said in times in the past that these products are very sticky with our customers because of the value proposition and the benefits goods that our manufactured components deliver to them which is very real. And that's been nothing but validated since the merger has come together, but that's why we drive productivity and efficiency. Right. We won't rest on our laurels, we know this will continue to be a competitive market and we have to earn that business with our customers each and every day. That's the mentality. I have some value our entire leadership team has around us. We take nothing for granted.\nDave Flitman: Yes, just from a modeling perspective, I think, how that manifests itself is a little bit of having both. There will be quarters when certainly the mom and pops will level things out in certain of the more commoditized product areas. Our commitment is to just to be the organization that wins at the end of the day, we think we can continue to perform better than market. We think our mix of products allows us to execute that achievement at a higher than higher than industry margin because of our ability to pull through that value-added mix, do it very efficiently and to manage the combined entity in a way to really leverage scale and drive through those investments in technology and leadership in ways that others can't touch. So certainly think it will continue to be competitive, what they said that doesn't change and there'll be some ebbs and flows and that never moves in a straight line, but we think that base business trend over time it's going to be - is going to be very desirable to all involved.\nMike Dahl: Okay, great, well thank you, both. I appreciate that and look forward to the Investor Day.\nDave Flitman: Thanks a lot Mike.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora of BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: Thank you and let me offer my congratulations as well. A really strong performance. Within manufactured products. I'm just curious, are there any specific product categories that you are seeing kind of stronger growth versus the others and that these labor challenges are kind of driving faster adoption of component offsite manufacturing.\nDave Flitman: Yeah, I think - the great news is we're seeing strength in all categories of our manufacturing components, whether it's a roof truss systems or floor systems, it has been well publicized. EWP has been a challenging supply environment this year through the great work of our - teams. All around the country we've been able to get the volumes that we needed, although it's been a price, and they remains there. But importantly also our Ready Frame is up over 30% this year on a year-to-date basis in-house count. So we're not really seeing any areas of weakness. And really the system approach that we're taking the structural design helps support all pieces of our manufactured components business. So we're excited about we're getting big traction everywhere.\nKetan Mamtora: And then my other question with other base business steadily moving higher, I'm just curious kind of how do you think, or is there any rethink in how you - how you look at the leverage on the Company.\nDave Flitman: So the base business is certainly a - but really important metric for us going forward for those that maybe don't remember is, is re baselining us at a normalized historical commodity value just taking all that volatility story. What that yields is sort of underlying business that's showing a steady strengthening and increased profitability and yeah, that is the basis for our leverage. We include that in in the investor presentation this quarter to give you an anchor point. We think that's the right way to think about how we're levered over time, because that's a part of the business you can really count on and rely on. So we're going to leverage based on that in terms of our guidance and our commitment over time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Reuben Garner of The Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner: Thank you. Good morning, everybody and congrats on the results. So can you just talk about, I mean the big businesses. I'm looking at it correctly, going to be up over 25% revenue this year. Profit is going to be growing north of 60%. What kind of gives you the confidence that you'll be able to grow. I think you made the comment that you think you can grow the base business next year. Can you just talk about what you're seeing that gives you that level of comfort.\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Well, a couple of things, first of all, I just want to be very clear. The strategy of the company is predicated on the base business and are always has been. So the fact that we've broken that out has provides an external clarity, but this is what we're trying to drive. Right. Our organic growth or value added portions of the business is at the heart of what we're trying to do and so I'm not surprised by it. And given the demand environment that we're seeing, we expect that will continue, but also in the areas of the value add that we're focused on, we have been for quite some time now taking market share and we do expect that will continue for a long time to come. So I just want to be clear though, this is the focus of the companies, with the leadership team is a breeze every day and that's what we're driving into the marketplace with our customers.\nReuben Garner: So, in an environment where maybe the starts single family or total DARTs are flat next year. Do you think that you still, with the backlog in the business that you have and the initiatives you have to grow the value add to be able to grow the business in that environment?\nDave Flitman: Yes, absolutely. And we do think, it's been well publicized here starts of slowed through the third quarter of this year but, but to a customer, every one of them point to supply chain challenges not weakening underlying demand. So there has been a little pause on stores and we saw that through the third quarter and you just see in our results. So that gives me even more confidence that we're going to be able to sustain our performance even in a weaker starts environment. These products are very sticky even if start slow, that the labor challenges are going away, the things we're delivering value on for our customers are not going to change for our value proposition is robust and strong in any stores environment.\nReuben Garner: Okay. And then last one for me. Are there any areas, most companies that have reported third-quarter results so far ran into some kind of supply chain issues and had volume even volume pressure in some cases. Are there any areas of your business that you're having product shortages or where there is bottleneck that you didn't see growth that's been pushed out to future quarters or if you guys have been able to overcome this somehow with your scale and reach.\nDave Flitman: Well, to your last point, I mean, our scale and reach is tremendous even more so in the combined company. And I think our procurement teams and our field leadership teams are now credited for the great work in securing what we needed for our customers. It has been a dog fight I believe all remaining that we also have great suppliers and they've been tremendous throughout this period in helping to get us more than our fair share in what our customers need. Now having said that, EWP remains a challenge. Even where we've seen lumber and OSB, for instance, kind of loosen up a little bit, the challenge is less than manufacturing right now it's more in drivers and given the, the material to the job sites from a lot of our suppliers, that's also been well publicized exterior doors are still a challenge. So things might be in a little different spot than they were three months ago, but there is still a widespread challenges that that we're up against in the industry every single day. And then just acknowledged your comment about the industry homebuilders wide any one of them that have had very much success this year have had to govern and sort of pull back a little bit on how many stores and how many sales they can make because of those, those same supply chain issues and availability issues. We certainly have seen that but we are not somehow immune to that. That has run through our numbers, but we've also seen the normalization in the bounce off the bottom. So I think there is, there is a lot of reason for optimism that this is a healthy industry making smart decisions about how much we can flow through given the constraints and really looking forward to the day when some of those constraints are.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Keith Hughes of Truist.\nKeith Hughes: Just getting back to the availability questions that we've had before. Are you seeing, if you could call it major product galleries, were you seeing things actually getting better sequentially or is the situation just not improved in the last 3 to 4 months.\nDave Flitman: Yeah, I would say Keith it's incrementally better, certainly on the commodity side of the business as I mentioned. That is loosened up a bit. Interior doors are better than they were a quarter ago. We're still struggling with exterior doors. Hardware remains a challenge, moldings remainder challenge. A lot of the specialty products are a real challenge. Windows remains in high demand and with - backlogs. Our team is working on that challenge. It has been for a long time. This is - the encouraging part of it is, even though our millwork, doors and windows organic growth was lower than our total or lower than our total for single-family, we have seen sequentially each quarter of this year that continue to improve. Right. We were at 19% this quarter versus single family of 27.5%, but we were 15-ish in Q2. So I think that just speaks to over to softening, but more importantly, the great work that our team continues to do every day to get us what we need.\nKeith Hughes: And final question. Comments from your builder customer, you talked about some of the slowdown they've, many of them have talked about. As I talk to you about next year are they expecting average pacing of completions during the year, more front loaded any sort of color you can give on that would be helpful.\nDave Flitman: Yeah, it's still early and we are in those conversations. But obviously we're kicking stars out of this year. We'll certainly many good things for the first half, at least the next year. The other piece of it, which we heard a little bit about is land and development of that and I think this gives them a chance to catch the breath, a little bit and get out in front of that a little bit, where I think they were may be caught off guard a bit with the strength of the start this year. But what we're hearing, by and large is continued strength and continued high demand for what we offer them.\nOperator: We'll move next to David Manthey of Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid Manthey: David mentioned Ready Frame and I was wondering if you could talk about what percentage of revenues that is today and what was the comparable figure in the third quarter of 2019. You also gave us an interesting stat there. You said that house count was up 30% year-over-year. Could you provide that number from the Third quarter of 2019 as well. Sorry for all the data request here.\nDave Flitman: Yeah, I know and we may have cash you offline on all that. I don't have all that in my fingertips at the moment Dave but just suffice as to say that we're quite pleased with the penetration that we continue to get and we've put to actually even in the BMC days we've put into looking at this more at a house account level to understand. It's more but organic growth of the business, how are we penetrating the market more. So that's really not a new metric for us and it takes out the noise around what's going on with the commodities in the revenues up and down and we were focused squarely in-house account penetration, as I said, that's up 40% over 30% this year and as you recall, last year was pretty strong. So we're excited about it. It is mirroring very much what's going on with our manufactured products in general and we expect that growth will continue.\nDavid Manthey: Okay, great. Yeah, I'll look forward to catching up with you on that. And my second question is on the software acquisitions. Could you describe how Apollo and Para kind of fit together and are there additional modules or capabilities that you're going to need to complete your tech platform or is this sort of a complete suite of software now.\nDave Flitman: We're very pleased with Paradigm and that is the broad capability - start the digital platform, right, and the configuration capabilities they have. That they comply almost exclusively to the newer portion of business. As I've said previously, we're excited to be able to take that on the prior categories and expand it more broadly. Apollo was a unique one and that was very opportunistic. If you saw that the - we got a really good deal on that. And it provides particularly mobile capability and some of the fast end works that the Paradigm - provide and take orders chance like management capability. And so we're excited about the end-to-end solution that we have now and if all pick up just say the development were from the back end.\nOperator: And we'll move next to those light to the site of Steven Ramsey. Your line is open.\nSteven Ramsey: Maybe to start with the synergies, can you clarify the new synergies are updated synergies, as you say, does that include any of the acquisitions that have been made. If I think about distributor acquisitions, the sales total over $600 million of. So it seems like there would be some meaningful synergies coming in.\nDave Flitman: Yeah. So it does not. Those are still - hose are limited to the DMC merger synergies. So midpoint of 100 on the P&L for '21 and mid-point of our run rate for what 150 by 2022. That does not include the tailwinds from the smaller entities not tracking in the same way. I don't think it's particularly helpful to report it in that consolidated way. It is showing up in the materials for the profitability obviously in that organic growth number. So probably we won't be breaking that out separately, but certainly we'll continue to talk about excellence metrics and where we can identify significant projects.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay, helpful. And then if I'm looking at this correctly, it appears the incremental margins on the base business in FY '20 and FY '21 guide or in the low 20% range above normal, is that expected to moderate as the environment in demand trends normalize over the next year, two years.\nDave Flitman: Yeah. So that goes back to kind of the, my comment about the unusual nature of the market in the current period, there certainly is some expectation that certain aspects of that will moderate things that were based on the timing of sourcing, the things that were based on usual disconnect service placements in the market there has though been a real trend of better discipline around pricing in the right markets making smarter decisions about how we provide value and are compensated for that value. So it's a mix. There will certainly be some underlying sustainable improvement and will probably get back.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll move to the side of Collin Verron of Jefferies. Your line is open. Mr. Verron, you may want to check your mute switch. Your line is open.\nMichael Neese: Leo, let's - we'll move to the next analyst please.\nOperator: We will. We'll move next to Kurt Yinger of DA Davidson. Your line is open.\nKurt Yinger: Kurt Yinger of DA Davidson. Your line is open.\nKurt Yinger: Great, thanks and good morning Dave and Peter Just on the base business. EBITDA increased to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion previously. Kind of curious what the moving pieces are there. Maybe it just goes back to kind of the last point around pricing discipline and whatnot, but it seems like a pretty nice uplift, considering the volume outlook and what is unchanged here. And then as we think about kind of building out 2022 kind of how confident are you in using that as kind of a good jumping-off point.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So the work in pricing. As you know, Kurt is something we've been focused on for a few years and putting these two teams together letting really high quality leadership to engage with that yield, working together, sharing best practices, that really has moved, we think, the baseline. I think that's certainly there were some examples of situations where we found ourselves in possession of product outline cost in terms of current pricing and not going to apologize for that. But certainly our ability to continue to be disciplined helped us in the quarter and will help us on an ongoing basis and that is the result of that historical investment, that alignment, the way we think about pricing, the tools we put in place, the way we train. All of that has come to fruition, particularly as you look at the business, this combined wealth, has a great market position and in markets around the country where there is just tremendous demand and growth, we're really well positioned.\nKurt Yinger: And then second, just as I think about the products you sell from a pricing perspective. Commodities, likely to be a headwind here over the next couple of quarters but you name it EWP, windows, siding doors, there is a pretty significant level of underlying price inflation out there. So can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about that impact on the top line here going forward and how it might help offset that drag from lumber and panels.\nPeter Jackson: Well, you're right, there is tremendous inflation in the marketplace. Like you said a number of different products, we are very focused on making sure we're passing that through. Some of the leverage you see from that is part of what is driving some of those margins, obviously. It doesn't cost any more to transport a more expensive piece of lumber window or door. It is probably a smaller component, but certainly important to mention. As we continue to see volatility in prices, we are going to maintain our discipline around passing it through. There will be instances where things will go back down and we all but adapt to that and make sure that you are still the provider of choice, that we're providing tremendous value to our customers, that are our products or relationships with vendors are served to move through, that the high volumes that our - that our vendors want to see to meet the demand that their customers want to receive but that dynamic, that ability to continue to be consistently disciplined, it is something we pride ourselves in and that's something I think we've proven the capability to do even in really unprecedented, we call it times.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Jay McCanless of Wedbush. Your line is open.\nJay McCanless: Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Great quarter both. So another question on Slide 16. It looks like the EBITDA ranges at all the dollar per MBF. All the EBITDA range has moved up. I guess: A, is that right, and then B, what's the biggest driver here is? is it a change in mix, some of the acquisitions. Just any - which one of these assumptions on the right hand side of the slide, which was the biggest driver on that.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah, no, The catch. So it doesn't move right when the base business on the prior slide bumps up, which we did increase the guide there. It reflects in that, that sensitivity on Slide 16 about what this business might look like at different commodity prices. It's a couple of factors. I - obviously with the growth of the value add faster than the four, you continue to see that favorable performance on an ongoing basis in what we consider base right that normalized margin level as a powerful influence on this. Our ability to manage price in see sustained margins across the portfolio and in the way we do things is certainly reflected in here. As this discipline around expenses, the improved performance and synergies, the operational excellence initiatives we're seeing in there are bearing fruit. All of that is in some way, contributing to the increased sort of starting point and as reflected on the sensitivity.\nJay McCanless: Great, thank you. And then my second question, I guess, staying on the slide, where, where did in the way you are calculating this blended. I think it's a blend of both framing lumber and sheet lumber. Where did this dollar per MBS in within the third quarter.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. So you're hitting a point that's always a challenge right it is. We don't know where commodities are going to go, it was certainly a bit of a surprise for us in terms of the guide in the back half of the year. It has absolutely leveled out above the $400 levels. It is going up, I mean branded alliances between 500 and 600 if you're talking about kind of lumber and sheet in terms of what we're seeing. We'll see where it goes from here. But on a year-over-year basis as Kurt mentioned earlier, there is certainly a turn in terms of the year-over-year comparisons, but still very, very strong and healthy from our - from a historical perspective. But at the end of the day, we're still going to circle back to base business and we're going to focus on running the quarter. We'll reap the benefits of commodities, but that's not where our attention is going to stay.\nJay McCanless: All right. And one other - one if I could sneak it in. Do you feel like from a pricing power perspective during the third quarter, did you get - were you able to take more price on the value-add goods or were you able to hold the line better on commodity goods even as the underlying commodity went down in price.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah, I'm actually proud of that and we did both. We did bout but I think there are certainly good discipline in not getting on certain products acknowledging the relationship working with customers, but at the same time switching vendors for quickly re-setting where appropriate, but it always focusing on getting paid for the value that we're providing appropriately. But really across the board. It's been a really positive story.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Iman Akram of Lord Abbott.\nIman Akram: Thanks for taking the question. Just back on the commodity front. Just want to better understand the lumber dynamics. How - like is there - when you're talking with contractors is there a pricing law for that log or - as the prices no or how does that market work.\nDave Flitman: Yes. So I mean it is - price is a small part of what we do now, it's certainly shrunk in recent years. The vast majority of what we're selling in the commodity space is quoted in pass-through in a pretty narrow period of time. We're pretty happy with that balance. The amount of inventory we have on hand and on order with the way we're quoting but we can walk through that in more detail for you offline. If you look at the end of the day with commodities important part of what we do, we think of our more important part is certainly the base business and what we're doing with the overall strategy.\nIman Akram: Okay, thanks. And yes, it will be helpful. If we could talk offline at some point.\nDave Flitman: Yeah, happy to do it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Gilbert of BTIG.\nRyan Gilbert: And my first question. Good morning. And I want to talk about, or I should say Peter you've talked in the past about the backup in units authorized but not started. And that's certainly something that we're seeing in the data and Dave, it sounds like based on your comments earlier builders are certainly planning for more units going ahead. I'm just wondering if you're, if you're seeing so far in the fourth quarter, some movement on getting those units started. Maybe a re-acceleration and starts or if we think that's more a 2022 story.\nPeter Jackson: So we. I think our, if we're looking at our numbers, our assessment is July was probably though we guessed in terms of the context of the business was bad, but it was weaker from a growth perspective than the rest of the year and we come back for them. So we started to see a little bit of a re-acceleration. I think what a bit on characterizing it, the homebuilders as a group sat down and said, oh, we've come way too many units under, under construction are not yet started. Let's govern this and there was a bit of a pause and then they continue to roll along trying to get to a point where it's very supportable and sustainable. I don't think it's possible to know that with precision but certainly, we know better now than we have in the past. And that does represent a bit of a re-acceleration in growth from that July's low point. - to say right, I mean it will always be dependent on weather, particularly this time of the year, but broadly speaking, there certainly a very strong demand and we do think those sold units and even some started units will accelerate and continue to grow just given that strong demand.\nDave Flitman: And we also know that they are squarely focused on winning completions between by the end of the year. And so, my earlier comment, I do think the stars growth will still and in the first half of next year quite nicely.\nRyan Gilbert: Second question is on multifamily just parsing the guide, it looks like we should expect a big year-over-year increase in - in multifamily in the fourth quarter and am I thinking about that correctly? And how does the pipeline or the backlog of multifamily projects look as you sit today.\nDave Flitman: Yes. No. Good question. So there is multi-families of venture and we like to be able to reference it as a comparison, the National Multifamily number but still it is not a comparable metric for us given we're really sort of focused on our few key regions around the country. A lot of movement within those, within the market is project driven. - the sort of lumpy moves in and out in any given period. I don't know that I agree that it's a large expected increase for the fourth quarter. I think we're still positive, I think that the one adjustment that I will highlight is we did dispose of our standalone gypsum business that did have some multifamily and commercial exposure fuel feel a little bit of moves in that in the R&R another bucket but it is pretty modest overall. It's a good area for us. We are seeing growth and we think that will continue through the fourth quarter and into next year.\nOperator: And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I'd be happy to return the call to Michael Neese for any concluding remarks.\nMichael Neese: Thank you for your time today and for your interest in Builders FirstSource as Dave mentioned, we are hosting an Investor Day on December 7th in the Dallas area. We look forward to hosting you in person or virtually through webcast, if you'd like to attend in person, please email me at michael.neese@bldr.com. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. I'll cover three key topics on today's call. First I'll provide a quick update on our record third quarter results, including our base business and our view of the current state of the housing market. Second, I'll provide an update on our recent tuck-in acquisitions that further strengthened our leading market position. And finally, I'll provide an update on the BMC integration, which is progressing exceptionally well and continues to track ahead of plan. As you can see on Slide 3, in the third quarter, our team delivered exceptional performance continue to produce core organic growth, expanded margins and delivered strong cash flow. Sales grew an impressive 63% to $5.5 billion. Embedded in our top line performance, we also delivered core organic growth of 16.1%. Gross profit expanded 103% to a new quarterly record. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled when compared to the prior year quarter to a record $976 million with adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 930 basis points to a record 17.7%. Finally, the increase of our EBITDA and margins helped us deliver approximately $1.1 billion in free cash flow while repurchasing 5.3% of our outstanding common shares. This strong performance underscores the strength of our industry-leading platform in the tremendous execution by our team members as we continue to outperform in our markets despite the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the homebuilding industry. Last quarter, in an effort to provide greater transparency into our underlying business performance, we provided an overview of the top and bottom line growth of our base business. As shown on Slide 6 for the full year of 2021, we now expect our base business net sales to grow to $15.7 billion from $12.5 billion or 26% and adjusted EBITDA to grow to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion or 64%. Over time, we believe our base business will sustain and grow our double-digit EBITDA margin and expect to deliver 11.2% EBITDA margin for the full year 2021. Demand for single-family housing continues to support our top line growth and we believe that growth will be sustained over time as demographics, continue to develop favorably coupled with more than a decade of under. For the quarter on a pro forma basis, our core organic customer growth was 27.5% for single family. Value added core organic sales grew by an estimated 31.2% led by 44.6% growth in our manufactured product category. Our team members are doing an outstanding job getting our customers what they need in a very challenging environment. Single family starts to increase to approximately 5% in the third quarter on tough comparisons to a strong prior-year period. However, we were encouraged to see our core organic growth remains strong as underlying demand leveled off during the quarter. In addition, looking beyond the effects of the pandemic in the third quarter of last year, single family starts this quarter grew 21% when compared with the third quarter of 2019, which are core organic growth outpaced by 650 basis points. The country has averaged 1.2 million units of existing inventory in 2021 which is 14% below the 5-year average and a roughly a third of historical highs. Single-family housing under construction also increased 31% in the third quarter. In fact, there are currently more single-family homes under construction across the country than they have been in more than 14 years and our homebuilder backlog is currently at the highest level it has been in the last 15 years. This data is an encouraging sign for our business as we finish 2021 and look to next year, and we expect demand to remain robust. On Slide 7, we are focused on executing our strategy of investing in growth. We have completed five sucking transactions in 2021 since merging with BMC and believe each acquisition as unique value to not only our portfolio of best in class solutions for customers, but also our geographic presence in attractive economically sound high growth markets. Turning to Slide 8, we were excited to welcome the California TrusFrame team to the Builders FirstSource family in the third quarter. CaliTrus was California's largest independent truss manufacturer and has added substantial and profitable scale through our value-added products business on the West Coast. This acquisition adds for our value-added portfolio and provide access to new customers for our continued growth. Also during the quarter, we acquired the Apollo software assets from former construction technology startup Katerra. The Apollo platform provides design collaboration and workflow, construction budgeting and scheduling and job site management capabilities combined with mobile functionality. A quick update on our Paradigm acquisition. The BFS and Paradigm teams have come together nicely and are aligning on our digital strategy to drive efficiency and residential construction which will create value for our homebuilder customers and revenue growth for us. Our teams have made a number of customer business which have helped us validate the market opportunity associated with developing an end to end digital solution. And we are now working with several customers on pilots that will improve the preconstruction process, create more accurate material lists, bring our supply partners into a digital workflow and better engage home buyers in the process. We remain confident in our investments in both Paradigm and Apollo and our ability to drive long-term value through digital transformation. Moving forward, we will continue to reinvest in our business to accelerate organic growth while actively pursuing accretive tuck-in M&A opportunities to improve our mix and build scale in key growth markets. We firmly believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation will allow us to remain a disciplined consolidator in this industry. Next. On Slide 10. I'll provide a brief update on the BMC integration. As reported last quarter, synergies are tracking one full year ahead of our plan and are projected to be in the range of $140 million to$160 million by the end of 2022 exceeding our initial expectations. We delivered $36 million in cost synergies in the third quarter and $74 million during the first nine months of 2021. We now expect 2021 cost synergies to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million and mid-point increase of $10 million above the expected outcome we reported in the second quarter. Our ability to achieve our synergy commitment in half the time underscores the cultural alignment of our two companies and the strength in collaboration of our leadership team. As we approach Veteran's Day, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank the veterans at BFS and their families. Earlier this fall. I had the honor of signing a statement of support on behalf of our company with the employer support of the Guard and Reserve or the ESGR, I had the privilege of meeting BFS team member and US Army veteran Corey Basinger. Corey spent 8 years in the Army and has been with BFS nearly 10 years. He is our maintenance manager in Houston, where he oversees critical facilities and equipment processes so we can seamlessly serve our customers. Corey receive the Pro Patria and above and beyond awards for his excellent leadership and supporting Guard and Reserve employees, in part due to do to his empathy, experience and understanding of what it means to be a veteran. Thank you. Cory, and thank you to all of our veterans for your service. With that let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q3 results and provide an update on our share repurchase program and our 2021 updated financial guidance. Thanks, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry momentum continues to be strong. Our core organic growth and in particular our value-added product categories is outpacing the industry in this unprecedented time given rapid growth in demand and widespread supply challenges. Our base business is large and we believe it will grow in 2022, the BMC integration and cost synergies are well ahead of schedule and the implementation of our digital strategy is ramping up. Our team is focused on operational excellence in delivering exceptional results for our customers and for our shareholders. I'm confident that our differentiated platform and our ability to invest organically and through M&A will deliver above market profitability and generate significant free cash flow for many years to come. Finally, we are excited to host our first ever Investor Day on December 7 and hope to see many of you here in the Dallas area. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. And then I would just add that we have re-companies in our ability to outpace the market and continue that in our value-added portions of the business, which is also helping to shift the mix of the company. As you saw the strong performance in manufactured products. We also had core organic growth above our average in our millwork, doors and windows business which has continued to strengthen throughout the year despite all the supply chain challenges with that. Yes, thank you. So with regard to the share buyback. To date, we're very, very pleased with what we've been able to accomplish. We think we were able to move, put a lot of capital toward this quarter added on an underpriced stock, and I think we're doing pretty well there. Certainly happy with the momentum. We do have remaining allocation. So we've all been authorized for another roughly $175 million. That is going to be our first priority. No new announcement today or anything into the future, but obviously we sort of demonstrated the way we think about the business and how we're going to work in terms of a balanced capital allocation. Yes, I'll start and then Peter down any color on it, but we continue to see very high demand in manufacturing performance. It's really not just in one geography, it's all across the country. And as we said when we combine these two companies, the complementary nature of our value-added capabilities was going to be very powerful and we certainly see that - see that play out exactly as we expect. I would tell you right now, we haven't more demand than we have capacity for our products and we expect that's going to continue. We have moved the market this direction and the labor challenges, the - the performance around inflation is real. Our customers are all talking about it, we've seen it every day and that's helped us continue to move the market towards offsite manufacturing and helping them be a lot more efficient at the job site. \\We have invested heavily in that part of the business and we will continue to do so to make sure we're meeting demand. Yes, just from a modeling perspective, I think, how that manifests itself is a little bit of having both. There will be quarters when certainly the mom and pops will level things out in certain of the more commoditized product areas. Our commitment is to just to be the organization that wins at the end of the day, we think we can continue to perform better than market. We think our mix of products allows us to execute that achievement at a higher than higher than industry margin because of our ability to pull through that value-added mix, do it very efficiently and to manage the combined entity in a way to really leverage scale and drive through those investments in technology and leadership in ways that others can't touch. So certainly think it will continue to be competitive, what they said that doesn't change and there'll be some ebbs and flows and that never moves in a straight line, but we think that base business trend over time it's going to be - is going to be very desirable to all involved. Thanks a lot Mike. Yeah, I think - the great news is we're seeing strength in all categories of our manufacturing components, whether it's a roof truss systems or floor systems, it has been well publicized. EWP has been a challenging supply environment this year through the great work of our - teams. All around the country we've been able to get the volumes that we needed, although it's been a price, and they remains there. But importantly also our Ready Frame is up over 30% this year on a year-to-date basis in-house count. So we're not really seeing any areas of weakness. And really the system approach that we're taking the structural design helps support all pieces of our manufactured components business. So we're excited about we're getting big traction everywhere. So the base business is certainly a - but really important metric for us going forward for those that maybe don't remember is, is re baselining us at a normalized historical commodity value just taking all that volatility story. What that yields is sort of underlying business that's showing a steady strengthening and increased profitability and yeah, that is the basis for our leverage. We include that in in the investor presentation this quarter to give you an anchor point. We think that's the right way to think about how we're levered over time, because that's a part of the business you can really count on and rely on. So we're going to leverage based on that in terms of our guidance and our commitment over time. Yes, absolutely. And we do think, it's been well publicized here starts of slowed through the third quarter of this year but, but to a customer, every one of them point to supply chain challenges not weakening underlying demand. So there has been a little pause on stores and we saw that through the third quarter and you just see in our results. So that gives me even more confidence that we're going to be able to sustain our performance even in a weaker starts environment. These products are very sticky even if start slow, that the labor challenges are going away, the things we're delivering value on for our customers are not going to change for our value proposition is robust and strong in any stores environment. Well, to your last point, I mean, our scale and reach is tremendous even more so in the combined company. And I think our procurement teams and our field leadership teams are now credited for the great work in securing what we needed for our customers. It has been a dog fight I believe all remaining that we also have great suppliers and they've been tremendous throughout this period in helping to get us more than our fair share in what our customers need. Now having said that, EWP remains a challenge. Even where we've seen lumber and OSB, for instance, kind of loosen up a little bit, the challenge is less than manufacturing right now it's more in drivers and given the, the material to the job sites from a lot of our suppliers, that's also been well publicized exterior doors are still a challenge. So things might be in a little different spot than they were three months ago, but there is still a widespread challenges that that we're up against in the industry every single day. And then just acknowledged your comment about the industry homebuilders wide any one of them that have had very much success this year have had to govern and sort of pull back a little bit on how many stores and how many sales they can make because of those, those same supply chain issues and availability issues. We certainly have seen that but we are not somehow immune to that. That has run through our numbers, but we've also seen the normalization in the bounce off the bottom. So I think there is, there is a lot of reason for optimism that this is a healthy industry making smart decisions about how much we can flow through given the constraints and really looking forward to the day when some of those constraints are. Yeah, I would say Keith it's incrementally better, certainly on the commodity side of the business as I mentioned. That is loosened up a bit. Interior doors are better than they were a quarter ago. We're still struggling with exterior doors. Hardware remains a challenge, moldings remainder challenge. A lot of the specialty products are a real challenge. Windows remains in high demand and with - backlogs. Our team is working on that challenge. It has been for a long time. This is - the encouraging part of it is, even though our millwork, doors and windows organic growth was lower than our total or lower than our total for single-family, we have seen sequentially each quarter of this year that continue to improve. Right. We were at 19% this quarter versus single family of 27.5%, but we were 15-ish in Q2. So I think that just speaks to over to softening, but more importantly, the great work that our team continues to do every day to get us what we need. Yeah, it's still early and we are in those conversations. But obviously we're kicking stars out of this year. We'll certainly many good things for the first half, at least the next year. The other piece of it, which we heard a little bit about is land and development of that and I think this gives them a chance to catch the breath, a little bit and get out in front of that a little bit, where I think they were may be caught off guard a bit with the strength of the start this year. But what we're hearing, by and large is continued strength and continued high demand for what we offer them. Yeah, I know and we may have cash you offline on all that. I don't have all that in my fingertips at the moment Dave but just suffice as to say that we're quite pleased with the penetration that we continue to get and we've put to actually even in the BMC days we've put into looking at this more at a house account level to understand. It's more but organic growth of the business, how are we penetrating the market more. So that's really not a new metric for us and it takes out the noise around what's going on with the commodities in the revenues up and down and we were focused squarely in-house account penetration, as I said, that's up 40% over 30% this year and as you recall, last year was pretty strong. So we're excited about it. It is mirroring very much what's going on with our manufactured products in general and we expect that growth will continue. We're very pleased with Paradigm and that is the broad capability - start the digital platform, right, and the configuration capabilities they have. That they comply almost exclusively to the newer portion of business. As I've said previously, we're excited to be able to take that on the prior categories and expand it more broadly. Apollo was a unique one and that was very opportunistic. If you saw that the - we got a really good deal on that. And it provides particularly mobile capability and some of the fast end works that the Paradigm - provide and take orders chance like management capability. And so we're excited about the end-to-end solution that we have now and if all pick up just say the development were from the back end. Yeah. So it does not. Those are still - hose are limited to the DMC merger synergies. So midpoint of 100 on the P&L for '21 and mid-point of our run rate for what 150 by 2022. That does not include the tailwinds from the smaller entities not tracking in the same way. I don't think it's particularly helpful to report it in that consolidated way. It is showing up in the materials for the profitability obviously in that organic growth number. So probably we won't be breaking that out separately, but certainly we'll continue to talk about excellence metrics and where we can identify significant projects. Yeah. So that goes back to kind of the, my comment about the unusual nature of the market in the current period, there certainly is some expectation that certain aspects of that will moderate things that were based on the timing of sourcing, the things that were based on usual disconnect service placements in the market there has though been a real trend of better discipline around pricing in the right markets making smarter decisions about how we provide value and are compensated for that value. So it's a mix. There will certainly be some underlying sustainable improvement and will probably get back. Yes. So I mean it is - price is a small part of what we do now, it's certainly shrunk in recent years. The vast majority of what we're selling in the commodity space is quoted in pass-through in a pretty narrow period of time. We're pretty happy with that balance. The amount of inventory we have on hand and on order with the way we're quoting but we can walk through that in more detail for you offline. If you look at the end of the day with commodities important part of what we do, we think of our more important part is certainly the base business and what we're doing with the overall strategy. Yeah, happy to do it. And we also know that they are squarely focused on winning completions between by the end of the year. And so, my earlier comment, I do think the stars growth will still and in the first half of next year quite nicely. Yes. No. Good question. So there is multi-families of venture and we like to be able to reference it as a comparison, the National Multifamily number but still it is not a comparable metric for us given we're really sort of focused on our few key regions around the country. A lot of movement within those, within the market is project driven. - the sort of lumpy moves in and out in any given period. I don't know that I agree that it's a large expected increase for the fourth quarter. I think we're still positive, I think that the one adjustment that I will highlight is we did dispose of our standalone gypsum business that did have some multifamily and commercial exposure fuel feel a little bit of moves in that in the R&R another bucket but it is pretty modest overall. It's a good area for us. We are seeing growth and we think that will continue through the fourth quarter and into next year."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. I want to thank all of our team members for delivering another incredible quarter. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our third quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior year quarter. Second, I'll update you on how we are deploying capital supported by strong operating cash flow. And third, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full year of 2021. Let's start with our Q3 results, we had net sales of $5.5 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 63% compared to the combined pro forma prior-year period. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 31.2% led by 44.6% growth in our manufactured products category. Robust in internationally continues to be constrained by supply chain challenge. Commodity price inflation benefited sales by 39% and acquisitions contributed another 8%. Gross profit was $1.7 billion, an increase of $868 million or 103% compared with the combined pro forma prior-year period. Our gross margin increased 620 basis points to 31.1% primarily driven by disciplined pricing in a volatile supply constrained marketplace along with effective and timely source. Based on our year-to-date experience with the combined entity, we now believe our normalized gross margins will be north of 26.5%. SG&A was $875 million, an increase of approximately $235 million or 36.7% compared to the combined pro forma prior-year period. This was driven primarily by expense related to the BMC merger and other acquisitions including amortization expense of acquired intangibles and one-time charges. Excluding acquisition related one-time charges and variable compensation, underlying SG&A increased 8.1%. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 300 basis points to 15.9% due to the impact of higher net sales and continued expense control, which more than offset higher variable compensation driven by the increase in net sales and profitability. Adjusted EBITDA increased 244.4% to $975.9 million driven by consistently strong single family home demand, commodity inflation, execution of merger related synergies and cost leverage. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 17.7%, an increase of 930 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro forma period. In Q3 adjusted diluted EPS was $3.39 compared to a combined pro forma of $0.74 in the prior year period. The more than 3-fold increase was primarily driven by the growth in operating income, partly offset by higher taxes. Now let's turn to cash flow, our third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion, driven by increased net sales and disciplined working capital management. Free cash flow was also a robust $1.1 billion during the quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $11 million shares or 5.3% of our common shares outstanding at an average price of $52.74 for a total cost of $578 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $422 million remaining under our existing $1 billion share repurchase authorization. In October, we repurchased an additional $4.5 million shares at an average price of $55.99, leaving approximately $172 million in our current authorization. On Slide 11 our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1 times our base business. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2027 and our total liquidity was roughly $1.5 billion consisting of about $1.3 billion of net borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility and $225 million in cash. Our strong third quarter and first nine months performance is a testament to our field teams who are delivering excellent value to our customers. We will continue to focus on growing the higher margin specialty and value-added products and services in our portfolio. And now let's discuss our 2021 full-year outlook, which we are revising upward and can be found on Slide 12. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. Based on our first nine months results, we are increasing our full year '21 outlook. Net sales is expected to grow to a range of $19.3 billion to $19.8 billion or approximately 51% to 55 over 2020 combined proforma net sales of $12.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $2.95 billion or approximately 166% to 176% of our 2020 combined proforma adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. In 2021, we expect BMC synergy savings of $90 million to $110 million to be recognized in the P & L. Free cash flow will be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. A decrease of $400 as the expected increase in EBITDA will be partially offset by higher cash tax. Our outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release including mid teen percentage growth and single family starts, R&R growth in the low single digits and multi-family starts growth in the high single digits. Overall, we are having a tremendous year. Our base business is robust and growing and we believe there is a long runway for growth into 2022 and beyond. We are focused on creating value for our stakeholders and are continuing to build our world-class distribution network founded on operational excellence and delivering exceptional value to our customers. Let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Yeah. Thank you. The gross margin numbers we're seeing now are really encouraging from our perspective, because it underscores the strength of the product portfolio the way we're combining the sales of value add with the other products. Certainly the tailwinds from commodities have been welcomed and I think we've done a nice job of generating real profitability and cash flow from it. There is also a little bit of unusual in this quarter and everybody is talking about it obviously given the supply chain constraints. That's caused some unusual numbers and some unusual dynamics based on timing and the price increases and things of that nature. So we can think it's a little bit unusual, certainly a significant portion of that gross margin fall through that comes from the benefit on commodities. And so the 26.5% is where based on what we've seen in the nine months combined in the company, we feel very good about. I think we sort of demonstrated a willingness to commit to things that we know we're confident in. I mean, we are very confident in that 26.5% or better. We're certainly thinking about it in context of the longer-range of the business. It was a more long-term normal where we think we can get to and we'll be talking a lot more about that in our Investor. The second part of your question there on M&A, we have been disciplined in our work both us in place. the companies have. As you probably expect there's been a lot of opportunities in the market through the course of this year. Valuations have. We've been disciplined around how we think about the long-term profitability of our targets, especially given the lumber environment that we've have here. We can get the deals that we want and we're going to stay disciplined around that. The five deals that we've done this year we feel very good about. And so we didn't say a lot about the pipeline slide in the deck, but it's still very strong and robust. And we're going to continue to play out our M&A in a way that makes sense for the company. Yeah, you see that point, we have a number of projects around the country where we have seen the utilization of our existing capacity to expand it. We can do that in a number of ways. The easiest way is obviously adding shifts, next would be adding equipment, automation equipment more sophisticated equipment, more equipment in total. Some limitations in that right now, just given the supply chains and availability of the wrong funds further up the supply chain and in greenfield along the line in greenfield, we know there are markets around the country that's been adopting this type of solution, this value-added solution, very, very quickly and we see tremendous opportunities in expanding our footprint, being the provider of choice and the provider with the best sort of variable cost position as we execute that as well to be successful long term. Well, certainly on the value-added portions of the business, we continue to see great adoption. We expect that that will continue. However, we have to remain competitive and to your point around that, this is still a very competitive market. We have seen as we said in times in the past that these products are very sticky with our customers because of the value proposition and the benefits goods that our manufactured components deliver to them which is very real. And that's been nothing but validated since the merger has come together, but that's why we drive productivity and efficiency. Right. We won't rest on our laurels, we know this will continue to be a competitive market and we have to earn that business with our customers each and every day. That's the mentality. I have some value our entire leadership team has around us. We take nothing for granted. Sure. Well, a couple of things, first of all, I just want to be very clear. The strategy of the company is predicated on the base business and are always has been. So the fact that we've broken that out has provides an external clarity, but this is what we're trying to drive. Right. Our organic growth or value added portions of the business is at the heart of what we're trying to do and so I'm not surprised by it. And given the demand environment that we're seeing, we expect that will continue, but also in the areas of the value add that we're focused on, we have been for quite some time now taking market share and we do expect that will continue for a long time to come. So I just want to be clear though, this is the focus of the companies, with the leadership team is a breeze every day and that's what we're driving into the marketplace with our customers. Yes. So the work in pricing. As you know, Kurt is something we've been focused on for a few years and putting these two teams together letting really high quality leadership to engage with that yield, working together, sharing best practices, that really has moved, we think, the baseline. I think that's certainly there were some examples of situations where we found ourselves in possession of product outline cost in terms of current pricing and not going to apologize for that. But certainly our ability to continue to be disciplined helped us in the quarter and will help us on an ongoing basis and that is the result of that historical investment, that alignment, the way we think about pricing, the tools we put in place, the way we train. All of that has come to fruition, particularly as you look at the business, this combined wealth, has a great market position and in markets around the country where there is just tremendous demand and growth, we're really well positioned. Well, you're right, there is tremendous inflation in the marketplace. Like you said a number of different products, we are very focused on making sure we're passing that through. Some of the leverage you see from that is part of what is driving some of those margins, obviously. It doesn't cost any more to transport a more expensive piece of lumber window or door. It is probably a smaller component, but certainly important to mention. As we continue to see volatility in prices, we are going to maintain our discipline around passing it through. There will be instances where things will go back down and we all but adapt to that and make sure that you are still the provider of choice, that we're providing tremendous value to our customers, that are our products or relationships with vendors are served to move through, that the high volumes that our - that our vendors want to see to meet the demand that their customers want to receive but that dynamic, that ability to continue to be consistently disciplined, it is something we pride ourselves in and that's something I think we've proven the capability to do even in really unprecedented, we call it times. Yeah, no, The catch. So it doesn't move right when the base business on the prior slide bumps up, which we did increase the guide there. It reflects in that, that sensitivity on Slide 16 about what this business might look like at different commodity prices. It's a couple of factors. I - obviously with the growth of the value add faster than the four, you continue to see that favorable performance on an ongoing basis in what we consider base right that normalized margin level as a powerful influence on this. Our ability to manage price in see sustained margins across the portfolio and in the way we do things is certainly reflected in here. As this discipline around expenses, the improved performance and synergies, the operational excellence initiatives we're seeing in there are bearing fruit. All of that is in some way, contributing to the increased sort of starting point and as reflected on the sensitivity. Yeah. So you're hitting a point that's always a challenge right it is. We don't know where commodities are going to go, it was certainly a bit of a surprise for us in terms of the guide in the back half of the year. It has absolutely leveled out above the $400 levels. It is going up, I mean branded alliances between 500 and 600 if you're talking about kind of lumber and sheet in terms of what we're seeing. We'll see where it goes from here. But on a year-over-year basis as Kurt mentioned earlier, there is certainly a turn in terms of the year-over-year comparisons, but still very, very strong and healthy from our - from a historical perspective. But at the end of the day, we're still going to circle back to base business and we're going to focus on running the quarter. We'll reap the benefits of commodities, but that's not where our attention is going to stay. Yeah, I'm actually proud of that and we did both. We did bout but I think there are certainly good discipline in not getting on certain products acknowledging the relationship working with customers, but at the same time switching vendors for quickly re-setting where appropriate, but it always focusing on getting paid for the value that we're providing appropriately. But really across the board. It's been a really positive story. So we. I think our, if we're looking at our numbers, our assessment is July was probably though we guessed in terms of the context of the business was bad, but it was weaker from a growth perspective than the rest of the year and we come back for them. So we started to see a little bit of a re-acceleration. I think what a bit on characterizing it, the homebuilders as a group sat down and said, oh, we've come way too many units under, under construction are not yet started. Let's govern this and there was a bit of a pause and then they continue to roll along trying to get to a point where it's very supportable and sustainable. I don't think it's possible to know that with precision but certainly, we know better now than we have in the past. And that does represent a bit of a re-acceleration in growth from that July's low point. - to say right, I mean it will always be dependent on weather, particularly this time of the year, but broadly speaking, there certainly a very strong demand and we do think those sold units and even some started units will accelerate and continue to grow just given that strong demand."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and thank you for joining Builders FirstSource Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource will now provide the company\u2019s opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you and your families continue to remain safe and well. With the increase in the COVID-19 Delta strain, our COVID task force continues to closely monitor the developments and we will continue to follow CDC guidance and protocols for the safety of our team members, customers, suppliers and communities. With me on the call today are Dave Flitman, CEO and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our second quarter results and provide an update on our base business momentum, our ongoing integration progress and achievements as well as our recent M&A. We remain bullish on the housing sector and believe we are well-positioned to continue to capture double-digit single-family starts growth. We have provided GAAP results that include BMC in the second quarter of 2021 and standalone BFS in the second quarter of 2020. We have also provided pro forma results as if we own BMC in the second quarter of 2020. Our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. The second quarter press release and the supporting presentation for today\u2019s call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they are useful to investors can be found in the earnings press release, our SEC filings and presentations. Our remarks in the press release, presentation, and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David.\nDave Flitman: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Our record second quarter and first half earnings are the result of the hard work and strong execution by our more than 26,000 team members who have been relentless in providing superior customer service amid robust demand in a very tight supply environment. I want to start by thanking them as I couldn\u2019t be more proud of their efforts. In the second quarter, we delivered core organic sales growth above 35%, along with record gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and margin. Our performance accelerated in the second quarter as we continued to expand our value-added offerings, executed disciplined pricing strategies and accelerated merger-related integration savings. I will cover three key topics on today\u2019s call. First, I\u2019ll provide an update on the residential housing environment, which remains very strong, review our second quarter results and given the unique demand and supply dynamics, share some insights into the strength of the underlying growth in our base business. Second, I\u2019ll provide an update on our recent M&A transactions that further strengthen our market position and advance our digital strategy and highlight our very strong pipeline of potential tuck-in acquisitions. And finally, I\u2019ll provide an update on the BMC integration, which is progressing exceptionally well and running ahead of plan. Let me start with the current state of the residential housing environment. we continue to see strong demand across the country. Specifically, single-family housing demand is robust and our entire supply chain is working hard to keep up with that strength. Regardless of short-term fluctuations, we believe the nation\u2019s homebuilding sector is growing today, and there is sustained growth in store for the next several years. Freddie Mac stated earlier this year that the U.S. is underbuilt by approximately 4 million homes. The National Association of Realtors believes we are 5.5 million homes underbuilt. Whichever number you believe, there is a significant shortage of housing in this country that will take many years of above normal starts to overcome. According to the NAHB\u2019s second quarter 2021 housing trends report, almost 20% of American adults are considering the purchase of a home within the next year. This statistics have increased for 5 consecutive quarters and is nearly double to 10% in Q1 of 2020. Additionally, 64% of these potential buyers are first-time buyers, which is the highest share in history. The millennial generation, some 82 million strong, will continue to provide support and growth in new housing construction for many years. There is also an extremely tight supply of existing homes for sale. We have averaged 1.1 million units of inventory in 2021, which is 20% below the 5-year average and well below the high of 3.5 million units of inventory in 2007. This data further supports our strong belief in the need for new home construction. Single-family starts increased 41.7% in the second quarter, which we outpaced by approximately 240 basis points with our single-family core organic growth. In addition, adjusting for the effects of the pandemic in the second quarter of last year, single-family starts this quarter grew 27% when compared with the second quarter of 2019. Housing under construction also increased 29% in the second quarter. There are now 439,000 more single-family homes under construction than there were at this time last year, and 396,000 more than at the same time in 2019. Some industry observers are racing to call at the top of the cycle, but the data tells us there will likely be continued strong momentum in new home construction, which will bode well for us and the industry as a whole. Recently, we\u2019ve heard from several of our homebuilder customers that they are tapping the brakes on starts for a few reasons, namely labor, material and land availability, even though demand remains strong. These challenges, coupled with the growth we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year, suggests builders are exceeding their growth forecast for this year and are pushing some new home construction into next year, supporting our belief that growth will continue for some time. And our 58% core organic growth in our Structural Components business, underscores our belief that our value-added offerings will be increasingly important to builders as they continue to navigate material and labor challenges and look for ways to get more efficient. Housing starts showing significant growth, mortgage rates remaining at historical lows and a continued shift to homeownership are all significant tailwinds. As a reminder, we are in 84 of the largest and fastest growing MSAs in the country. Our team is poised to continue to capture a disproportionate share of the growth as we have done for the past several years and as evidenced by our most recent 260 basis point outperformance over the last 6 months. I am confident we will outperform the market in any environment. And what we are experiencing now is exactly what we envisioned when we put our merger together. A best-in-class operation located in the top markets in the country, focused on serving customers with the best portfolio of products and services and solving their construction challenges. We have a seasoned, cycle-tested management team, and we are just getting started. Now let\u2019s turn to our record second quarter results. We delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line performance and importantly, core organic growth of 44.1% in our single-family segment and 58% in manufactured components, again outpaced the market as we continue to gain share. Turning to Slide 4, I will review our pro forma results for the quarter. Total sales grew 91% to $5.6 billion. Core organic sales increased 35%. Gross profit expanded more than 105% and adjusted EBITDA increased a remarkable 232% to $836 million with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding by 640 basis points to a record 15%. Turning to Slide 5, we have received many questions from analysts and investors regarding the impact of commodities on our business results. In response, we are providing an overview of the underlying top and bottom line growth of our base business, on a normalized basis, assuming a static commodity price of $400 per thousand board feet. For the full year 2021 versus 2020, we expect our base business net sales to grow to $15.3 billion from $12.5 billion or 22% and adjusted EBITDA to grow to $1.6 billion from $1.1 billion or 45%. Given consistent single-family starts, we believe our 10.1% EBITDA margin on our base business is sustainable and can grow over time, as evidenced by our 240 basis points of growth since 2019. That\u2019s a 31% improvement in profitability in 2 years. Peter will go into further detail in his prepared remarks, but I want to point out to everyone that our base business is large, it\u2019s growing, and it has a sustained double-digit EBITDA margin profile. Now, let me spend a bit of time on M&A and our recently announced transactions, Alliance Lumber, which closed on July 1 and Paradigm for which we signed a definitive purchase agreement in late June. Turning to Slide 6, Alliance Lumber is the largest supplier of building materials in Arizona, primarily serving the fast-growing greater Phoenix, Tucson and Prescott Valley metropolitan areas. The Phoenix Metro area alone is expected to add more than 100,000 jobs in 2022, so we\u2019re excited about our increased presence in the state. Arizona is the number three ranked single-family MSA in the U.S., encompassing the nation\u2019s fastest growing county, Maricopa. This acquisition is aligned with our strategy of investing organically and through M&A to grow our portfolio of high-value and faster growth categories. Alliance has an estimated 45% market share with the top homebuilders and catapults us to a leading position in the state. Its geographic footprint and component manufacturing capability is an excellent strategic fit. And the limited overlap of our existing coverage enables us to expand our product offerings into previously untapped regions. Alliance is margin accretive and we have an opportunity to embed our millwork capability into their operations. With deep, longstanding customer relationships and a reputation for offering outstanding customer service, Alliance is an established and trusted adviser to leading homebuilders and contractors across single-family, multifamily and commercial end markets. Founder and CEO of True Carr and his team have built a fantastic company with strong leadership and values that align to our own in a similar culture of growth. We are thrilled to have the Alliance team members as part of the BFS family. Now turning to Slide 7, I want to spend a few minutes on our strategy and recent M&A in the digital space, which has been a priority and focus for us over the last several years. Based on third-party research, the homebuilding market is lagging almost every other industry in digital transformation. As the new generation of builders emerges, a generation that grew up with digital technologies, which has accelerated given the impacts of COVID, we are seeing a shift in how our customers want to do business. And we see this trend having a long tail as adoption accelerates. Digital is a significant growth opportunity for BFS as the industry goes through a shift to digital execution. Given the scale of our platform, we feel we are well positioned to help shape important outcomes for our industry, including improved efficiencies and productivity through digital technologies. Our digital strategy includes three main areas: first, a focus on our internal processes and productivity by investing in technology to drive operational efficiency and excellence; next, help streamline interactions with our vendors and customers; and finally, a focus on external innovation and investment to offer value-added digital products and services that support our customers\u2019 success and growth. On June 29, we announced a major step forward in our digital strategy with our intent to acquire Paradigm, an innovative software solutions company that is transforming the way new construction and renovation this time. Over the past 20 plus years, Paradigm has grown to over 300 employees, serving more than 250 customers spanning homebuilders, lumber yards, manufacturers, retailers and distributors with an expanding list of 70,000 end users. From home visualization to material takeoff technology to drafting services and estimating, Paradigm software platform helps increase sales and operational efficiencies for new construction and renovation businesses. The addition of Paradigm offers several compelling strategic benefits to Builders FirstSource. Specifically, we will scale Paradigm\u2019s platform from the current 250 customers to our broader base of 70,000 customers. Paradigm\u2019s platform will help us drive internal productivity in our team of over 700 designers and estimators. Paradigm provides another value-added capability to reduce inefficiencies and costs for our homebuilder customers, strengthening our current partnerships. And finally, and most impactfully, we believe we can capture more than $1 billion of incremental sales over the next 5 years by utilizing our digital assets to accelerate the adoption and capture rates of value-added products. To be clear, neither Alliance nor Paradigm signal a change in our M&A strategy. We will continue to reinvest in our business while actively pursuing accretive tuck-in M&A opportunities to improve our mix and build scale in key growth markets. As you can see on Slide 11, we have identified more than 460 targets in the $15 million to $100 million revenue range. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation will allow us to be a disciplined consolidator in this industry for a long time to come. Finally, I\u2019d like to update you on the BMC integration, which is going very well. Synergies are tracking 1 year ahead of plan and are projected to exceed our initial expectations. Through the second quarter of this year, we have already captured $36 million in cost savings. Based on our progress to-date, we are increasing our synergy targets. Specifically, we are raising our year one 2021 projected savings to between $80 million and $100 million from the $60 million to $70 million we had previously communicated and now, we expect to achieve total synergies of between $140 million to $160 million by the end of 2022, allowing us to overachieve in just 2 years versus our original 3-year commitment of between $130 million to $150 million. These increased synergy targets underscore the success of the BMC integration to date. In addition, our teams are working closely together to leverage our scale and product offerings. Specifically, we\u2019ve been able to create additional capacity for our component facilities in overlap markets, accelerating growth in that key category. We have also been able to use our combined relationships to divert more national builders in attractive markets, accelerating growth in structural components, READY-FRAME and our millwork offerings. These are exciting times and our outstanding results reflect the strong housing market and underlying demand for new homes. Our industry leading platform, coupled with our ability to deliver value to our customers, and a continuation of our disciplined approach to cost management and operational excellence, and we are confident in our ability to consistently execute at a very high level. In conclusion, I would like to highlight one of our many valued associates. Nothing is more important than safety of our team members here at BFS. It takes hard work and commitment to build and maintain a strong safety culture. I wanted to spotlight someone who is going above and beyond to lead that culture in her location. Kelly Rhodes is a regional safety manager in Oklahoma. She and her team invited OSHA to voluntarily visit the North Oklahoma City lumber and millwork location to further improve their safety and health program. While there, the OSHA representatives were so impressed that they gave Kelly a special OSHA commemorative coin as a token of appreciation for a successful inspection and for their outstanding training documentation. Dedicated team members like Kelly help reinforce our safety culture, and we are glad to have her on our team in Oklahoma. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q2 results and our 2021 updated financial guidance.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. I want to thank all of our team members for delivering incredible results. Your execution is rock solid. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I will review our second quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior year quarter. Second, I will discuss our financial position, supported by a strong operating cash flow. And third, I will provide some color on our guidance raise for the full year 2021. Starting with our Q2 results, we had net sales of $5.6 billion for the first quarter, which increased approximately 91% compared to the combined pro forma prior year period. Turning to Slide 13, value-added core organic sales increased by 35% led by 58% growth in our manufactured products category and 17% growth in our windows, doors and millwork category. Commodity price inflation benefited net sales by 52% and acquisitions contributed 3.5%. We experienced stronger than expected demand in Q2 single-family starts across the country, and we were well positioned to support this demand and take market share. Our Q2 gross profit of $1.6 billion increased 105% year-over-year, while our gross margin expanded 210 basis points to 28.4%, above our stated more than 26% long-term target, primarily driven by disciplined cost and pricing management and a dynamic supply-constrained marketplace. SG&A was $902.9 million, an increase of approximately $324 million compared to the combined pro forma prior year period, driven primarily by expenses related to the BMC merger and other acquisitions, including intangible amortization and onetime charges. Variable compensation was also higher due to the increase in net sales and profitability. Excluding acquisition-related onetime charges, underlying SG&A increased by 18.9%. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 360 basis points to 16.2% due to higher sales and continued expense control. Adjusted EBITDA increased 232% to $835.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 15%, an increase of 640 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro forma period, driven primarily by higher sales at strong margins and cost management, including synergy savings. In Q2, adjusted EPS was $2.76 per share compared to combined pro forma of $0.64 a share in the prior year period. The 331.3% increase was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, offset by higher tax and higher SG&A expenses due in part to the normalization of COVID expense costs. Adjusted EPS excludes amortization and onetime expenses related to merger and acquisition activity. Let\u2019s turn to cash flow. Our second quarter operating cash flow was an outflow of $3.3 million and free cash was an outflow of $56 million, primarily due to the impact of commodity inflation on working capital. Turning to Slide 15, at the end of the second quarter, our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 1x. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2027 and our total liquidity was approximately $750 million, providing us with significant financial flexibility. Last month, we successfully completed an opportunistic offering of $1 billion of aggregate principal amount of 4.25% unsecured senior notes due in 2032, further strengthening our balance sheet. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the credit facility with remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. Our strong second quarter and first half performance are the result of superior execution from our field teams. They are meeting the demands of the strong market momentum while delivering excellent service to our customers. While the impact of increased commodity costs is evident in our results, our structural focus remains on profitable growth in our base business. As Dave mentioned, our base business EBITDA is expected to grow 45% this year. We will continue to focus on growing the higher-margin specialty and value-add products and services in our portfolio. At the $400 per thousand commodity level, our value-added mix is roughly 43% of our total sales. From 2019 to 2021, our base business net sales are projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 15.4%, while our EBITDA is projected to grow 32%. That exceptional base growth is expected to be further augmented by commodity tailwinds. In the appendix of the investor presentation on Slide 20, we\u2019ve also provided a sensitivity analysis with various commodity cost assumptions and the corresponding profits if you assume static commodity prices at those levels. Please keep in mind that shorter-term price fluctuations can result in materially different results than in a static commodity environment. Most importantly, the base business perspective provides a sharper view of our run rate regardless of where commodity prices ultimately settle. We believe we can continue to grow our base business next year while sustaining a double-digit EBITDA margin. Let\u2019s turn to our 2021 full year outlook on Slide 16. Our differentiated platform is delivering above-market growth and strong results, which we expect to continue. We are seeing strong underlying demand in both new housing construction and remodel. As we anticipated, builders are seeing such strong demand that they are limiting sales in certain communities to maintain backlogs at prudent levels, given material and labor constraints. Based on our stellar first half performance, our positive conversations with customers, our accelerated integration synergy capture, a better view of our inflation environment and our continued strong organic sales through July, we are increasing our full year 2021 outlook. We expect net sales in the range of $18 billion to $19 billion representing growth of approximately 41% to 48% over 2020 combined pro forma net sales of $12.8 billion. This is driven by an increase in new starts as the key catalyst for our base business growth plus the benefit of robust but receding commodity prices. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, or approximately 105% to 124% over 2020 combined pro forma adjusted EBITDA and of $1.07 billion. We expect to deliver significant free cash flow over the next 6 months based on normal seasonal flows, declining commodity prices and an active working capital management. Our 2021 free cash flow guidance increases by $100 million to approximately $1.5 billion as increased EBITDA is partially offset by higher working capital from higher sales as well as higher taxes and interest. Our outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release, including: mid to high teen percentage growth in single-family starts; our R&R growth in the low to mid-single digits; and multifamily starts growth in the high single digits. As discussed earlier, our commodity assumption provides an 18% to 28% lift to our base business sales growth. Commodity costs have come down over the past several months, and we expect OSB in particular to continue to come down, during which time, we will remain vigilant as we sell through our higher commodity cost materials. Despite the commodity price volatility, we feel confident in hitting our full year guidance. As Dave mentioned, the integration with BMC is ahead of our initial expectations. We now expect to deliver cost synergies of $80 million to $100 million this year. And in addition, we remain focused on accelerating our operational excellence initiatives. Turning to capital allocation, since the merger of BFS and BMC 7 months ago, we have spent considerable time focused on our strategic alignment and the analysis of the best way to deliver value to our shareholders over the long-term. As a result, our priorities for balanced capital deployment are in order, maintaining a strong balance sheet, reinvesting in our business to drive growth and productivity, continuing our tuck-in M&A strategy to grow our capabilities in desirable markets across the country with a specific focus on value-added capabilities, and returning capital to shareholders as appropriate. As part of our balanced capital deployment strategy, we are setting our leverage target in the 1 to 2x range, recognizing that we will appropriately adapt that range to the economic cycle. We remain well positioned to deploy capital effectively after executing multiple value-enhancing transactions, given our robust balance sheet and strong M&A pipeline. Overall, the financial results for the first 6 months have been extraordinary. Our base business is robust, and we believe there is a long runway for growth in the years ahead. We are focusing on creating value for our stakeholders and are continuing to build our world-class distribution network founded on operational excellence and delivering exceptional value to our customers. Let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Flitman: Thanks Peter. In summary, demand in single-family housing remains exceptionally strong, and we continue to capitalize on this positive trend by ensuring we meet the needs of our customers, both today and in the future. The BMC integration continues to progress extraordinarily well, and our realization of cost synergies is a year ahead of schedule. Looking forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy of investing both organically and through M&A to continue to align our portfolio with high value and faster growth categories while simultaneously improving efficiencies, productivity and our digital capabilities in the value chain. Our future is bright, and our ability to execute and our hunger to innovate have never been stronger, and we will continue going above and beyond for our customers and partners to provide best-in-class homebuilding solutions. With that, Sarah, let\u2019s open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner: Thank you. Good morning everybody.\nDave Flitman: Good morning, Reuben.\nReuben Garner: So first off, thanks for all the detail in the deck. I think that\u2019s all going to be very helpful for folks seeing how much of your business is not really driven by this lumber market. So maybe if I could start, you mentioned your visibility into next year, how much visibility do you have? In other words, how much business do you think this year is going to be pushed out to next year for you guys? I mean you\u2019re putting up big growth numbers in your manufactured business despite this. Any color into what\u2019s going to get pushed out into 2022?\nDave Flitman: Yes. Reuben, as I mentioned in my comments, we\u2019ve been in contact with our customers quite regularly. And almost without exception, you\u2019ve seen them kind of slow the starts for this year with the intent of pushing demand into next year. And almost to a person, they said this is the strongest environment they have operated in many through their careers. Given the state of the demand which is much, much different than it\u2019s been in a very, very long time, interest rates, we expect the continuation of what we\u2019ve seen this year into next year. And I\u2019d also point out, our focus on our value-added portions of our business are just continuing to gain momentum. And I said it in the script, and I\u2019ll say it again, I\u2019ve got confidence in our ability to continue to drive growth and take share in any market environment.\nReuben Garner: Perfect. Very helpful. And then secondly, on the free cash flow, Peter, it\u2019s a little \u2013 I guess, maybe if you could help us out, what free cash flow have you generated thus far in the year? How much working capital investment is, I guess, embedded in that number? I am just trying to figure out, kind of, what\u2019s left to go, what\u2019s sort of the normalized number there and where your balance sheet will stand as we kind of enter 2022. Congrats on the results guys and thanks for your help.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Thanks, Reuben, and great question. It\u2019s been a dynamic year for cash flow as you highlighted. We have seen an investment of over $1.1 billion year-to-date in our working capital space, right? We\u2019re not yet \u2013 while the market is certainly turning, we\u2019re not yet on burning through either the summer build of normal inventory or the higher prices that we bought through all year. So year-to-date, our free cash flow has been at use right around $300 million. We do expect to generate the remainder, so the \u2013 about $1.8 billion between now and the end of the year. We\u2019ve already started to see that generation in the third quarter. Third quarter will be a very good year, as you would expect as the market turns, and still a significant amount of cash generation into the fourth quarter. So certainly see a clear line of sight of where that will take us. $1.8 billion of additional cash from now to the end of the year is certainly going to put us in a very strong position to deploy capital in ways that will benefit shareholders.\nReuben Garner: Perfect. Thanks again and good luck looking forward.\nDave Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, I wanted to pick up on the cash flow and also the capital allocation, Dave. Peter, I think you have a more technical and colorful term for how much cash is coming in the next 6 months, a little restrained here, not even that. But if you look at that turn lever currently, that\u2019s clearly going to come down when you kind of net out the cash in the second half versus the M&A, you still wind up close to zero net debt. So that kind of checks off the box on a maintained strong balance sheet. When you think about the three other priorities, I know it\u2019s in order here from kind of a medium to longer-term standpoint. But when you\u2019re thinking more near-term in nature, next couple of quarters, next few quarters, is there any bias across the three? I mean whether it\u2019s reinvesting internally for their tuck-in M&A or returning capital? That last one hasn\u2019t been a part of the pro forma company yet. So, just any color on kind of more near-term, how that balance shakes out?\nPeter Jackson: So, a couple of comments, obviously, really excited about the strength of the balance sheet. Our action to put structural very favorable debt out there, the 2032 notes 4.25% unsecured is something we\u2019re very proud of. One of the agencies gave our secured notes and investment-grade rating. We certainly are proud of what we\u2019ve done on the balance sheet and excited about what that means. To your point, we\u2019ve put our priorities out there. I think we are excited about what the pipeline looks like for opportunities to continue to grow in M&A, but we\u2019re going to remain disciplined. We\u2019re not going to get out over our skis on valuations. We\u2019re very clear-eyed about what commodities do over time, that can\u2019t be a driver. And we think that, that pathway will certainly yield opportunities. Your comment about not having done share buybacks as a pro forma entity is absolutely correct. Both prior entities have done share buybacks. So I don\u2019t think anybody is necessarily opposed to the concept. It\u2019s more a matter of making sure we\u2019re looking at the situation each month, each quarter and making the absolute right decisions for the long term for our shareholders. So we\u2019re going to stay committed to that, and we will continue to message as things develop.\nMike Dahl: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. My second question is just on the manufactured products, I mean that is exceptional growth even in a \u2013 even against the strong market backdrop. And so clearly, there is some share gains there. I know it\u2019s probably difficult, but is there any way that you could kind of talk to how much of that growth was effectively seeing increased adoption or conversion within your existing customer base, versus potentially the added capacity that you\u2019ve brought on and/or just a higher customer count in your manufactured products segment? Thanks.\nDave Flitman: Mike, this is Dave. We had both legacy companies, as you know, had strong underlying momentum and a strong focus on manufactured components for a long time. And both of us, we\u2019re continuing to gain share. When we put this team together, we knew, particularly in overlap markets, there will be increased opportunities for us to accelerate that growth, both internally based on what we were doing with our assets and where we saw opportunities to extend capacity, which has been very tight in some markets where we\u2019ve had rapid adoption. But importantly, continuing to convert customers at a higher rate. Those new customers, what I would say more importantly and probably more impactfully, is accelerating growth with customers we\u2019ve already had relationships in certain geographies and our merger helped them get more comfortable in accelerating and extending that across their footprint.\nMike Dahl: That\u2019s good to hear. Thanks, Dave. Thanks Peter.\nDave Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we will take Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning everyone. Hey, Dave, thank you for taking the questions. I echo\u2026\nDave Flitman: Sure. Happy Birthday, Matt. We appreciate you spending your Birthday morning with us. I think, you ought to get a bigger size piece of cake for that.\nMatthew Bouley: This is exactly what I imagine for my Birthday, so much appreciated. So, yes, well, you provided a gift here, so a lot of things to ask about. Let me ask about the digital opportunity, the $1 billion. Dave, you mentioned at the top that you\u2019re going to \u2013 part of this is using, if I heard you correctly, Paradigm to accelerate value-add adoption. And you list on one of the slides that there is \u2013 look like four or five kind of drivers of the $1 billion. And what I\u2019m wondering is kind of \u2013 if you could kind of bucket that out, how much comes from scaling the Paradigm software versus how much comes from that litany of internal drivers and across wallet share and driving value-add adoption? Thank you.\nDave Flitman: Well, the internal piece \u2013 I appreciate the question \u2013 the internal piece is something internally that we feel strongly about where we can gain some efficiencies, and just we are internally today have very manual processes as we go from design to estimating for our customers. And there are two key things that are going to help us accelerate towards that $1 billion. And obviously, these are early days, and we still have a lot to figure out. And, by the way, we haven\u2019t closed the transaction yet. But in our early thinking, we see opportunities to extend their platform more broadly across our customer base, which Nathan and his team have done a great job to get the customers that they have gotten, but we just got a bigger platform in the ability to scale that. But if you think also about long-term, being able to automate our design and takeoffs and actually provide our customers with an estimate of our full capability, including our manufactured components and READY-FRAME and even further down our millwork capability, which is at the core of what Paradigm does today, we just see that ability and the ease with which we will be able to do that over the long-term, being a great value proposition for our customers and the ability to get our value-added products in front of them in a more seamless way.\nMatthew Bouley: Wonderful. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And yes, we will look for that additional color upon the deal closure, but that is very helpful. Second one on the margin side. You made a comment at the top that the base business margin, the 10.1% this year is something that you see as sustainable, if not with the potential to further expand. If I\u2019m doing the math right, with a little bit of rounding, it looks like your core base business incremental margin in the guide this year is right around 18% give or take. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But \u2013 so high level, the question is, \u2013 is it that you can further expand structural gross margins? Or is it that you\u2019re shifting to additional SG&A leverage? And I think one thing that would be helpful to address a common question we get from investors is if any of the base business margin, that 10%, if you think any of that may have also been temporarily benefited by extreme lumber prices and shortages there? So it\u2019s a long question, but I would appreciate any color. Thank you.\nDave Flitman: Yes, there is a lot in that. Let me try to unpack it a little bit, and then I\u2019ll have Peter come over the top with any further color. But I am confident in our ability to continue to expand that margin over the long haul. I think to your last question, no, I don\u2019t think there was any outsized impact based on lumber in that. And as you think about our core business, and as Peter highlighted, 43% of that today roughly is our value-added areas. With the growth that we see, the continued improvement in mix, we just accelerated our synergy capability here. We\u2019re going to capture that over the next 6 to 12 months. And in addition to that, you think about our ability to drive operational excellence in this combined company, which we\u2019re just starting to think about and get after over the long haul. We see the ability to continue to improve our margins over time. So it\u2019s a combination of growth and internal work that we see going on that will continue to enable us over the long haul to expand those margins.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So, just a little bit of color on that, Matt, we have seen a couple of, I\u2019d call it, leakage of the impact and the acceleration of price in the marketplace into other buckets, we try to normalize for that in here. We try to look at the margins that we thought were sustainable over the long-term. We\u2019ve talked in the past about sort of a normalized amount of gross margin. We try to account for that in this and allow the rest of it to slosh over into the commodity unusual pricing bucket. So I think that is an important one. And like I said, we have a lot of different ways to drive the performance of this business on a go-forward basis. And I think it\u2019s all of the above. It\u2019s that expanded value add, it\u2019s the efficiency in that more gross margin line, it\u2019s the efficiency in SG&A, a lot of operational excellence, a lot of improvements that we think we still have in front of us as we continue to solve problems for our customers and just grow.\nMatthew Bouley: Wonderful. Well, that is very clear. Thank you, Peter and thank you, Dave and best of luck guys.\nDave Flitman: Appreciate, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will take our next question from David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Hi, thank you. Good morning everyone.\nDave Flitman: Good morning, Dave.\nPeter Jackson: Good morning.\nDavid Manthey: So lumber prices, they clearly have an impact on both the OpEx leverage in the P&L and the gross margin itself via mix. But as we look at the table in the appendix sort of top to bottom, are we to assume that behind that, you\u2019re looking at SG&A dollars that are materially flat in every one of those states of being in that appendix table?\nPeter Jackson: No. Our expectation is that about roughly 70% of SG&A remains variable. That\u2019s the rule of thumb that we\u2019ve used historically. I mean this is base only. So you have to sort of exclude that commodity price fluctuation component.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And then secondly, as it relates to the table as well, you note here that these are constant lumber prices for the full year. And just to level set, can you talk about the dynamics in real life as you move from tier-to-tier across this table, just what are some of the moving parts that we should look for as you sort of chase lumber prices up and down and the impact on the P&L?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yes. I mean I think it\u2019s consistent with what we have said in the past about commodities. We certainly want investors and view the analyst community to have a clear understanding of how our business works. As you deal with the increases and decreases in commodities, there are certain characteristics of certain parts of the country that are impactful on the results. When you have inflation, where you\u2019ve got longer fixed-price contracts, whether it be 60 days and the smaller percentage that\u2019s left that are the 90 days or 90 days plus, you inevitably will see a compression in the gross margin percentage as that inflation occurs. And then as it reverses, you\u2019ll see an expansion in the gross margin percentage. Inversely, you will also see it in markets with very, very fast pricing turns where everything is very short. Sometimes you will see the exact opposite, where you will see expanding margins on the way up and declining margins on the way down as you\u2019re pricing off a replacement in a very fast turnaround environment. By and large, we, of course, want to make sure we\u2019re turning inventory quickly so that whatever those impacts are, they happen quickly, right? They pass through very quickly. We\u2019re \u2013 and I\u2019ll reemphasize this, we\u2019re not in the game of predicting and betting on commodities. We\u2019re in the game of distributing commodities to the advantage of our broader business. And I think that our demonstrated performance historically shows that we\u2019re pretty good at it. We know how to make money in ups and downs. It\u2019s a matter of making sure you\u2019re running it in a disciplined and operationally excellent manner.\nDavid Manthey: That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will move on to Keith Hughes with Truist.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. Question on the manufactured products number, I know that does get impacted by commodity inflation. So is there a way you can talk about units, how much units were up year-over-year?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So that\u2019s the attempt. That 58% excludes what we believe to be the overlap from commodities. That\u2019s actually a new note 48% in there, Keith, on Slide 5. In that footnote, you can see we sort of called out, it\u2019s about 4% of that 22% that has some exposure to commodities, as you think about the commodities are included in what we manufacture.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. So that gets closer we can get to a unit number, is that what you\u2019re trying to say?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Well, we\u2019ve communicated at close. Based on our analysis of price volume mix, that\u2019s our best estimate, yes.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. And second question on the guidance for the second half implies EBITDA up year-over-year, is that going to slant towards the third or fourth quarter given commodity impact or any sort of directional guidance there would be helpful?\nPeter Jackson: Well, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to say third quarter is always higher than the fourth quarter just due to normal seasonality.\nDave Flitman: Normal seasonality.\nPeter Jackson: And I think that the impact of commodity is as it occurs.\nKeith Hughes: I\u2019m talking about the gain year-over-year. Because the slant \u2013 is there going to be more of a gain in one quarter versus the other?\nPeter Jackson: Based on a prior year comparison?\nKeith Hughes: Yes.\nPeter Jackson: I hope I know that off the top of my head.\nKeith Hughes: Okay, you can get back on this one.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. It\u2019s probably a little more weighted to Q3. Just by nature of the seasonality, it\u2019s a little bigger and the fall-through would be a little bigger in that quarter.\nKeith Hughes: Okay, alright. Thank you.\nDave Flitman: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will take our question from Steven Ramsey, Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsey: Hi, good morning. Maybe to start with on the divestiture of the gypsum operations, is that a meaningful impact to the incremental margins that are non-lumber?\nPeter Jackson: No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a fairly small business in total, and the margins were below average.\nSteven Ramsey: Great. And then thinking about product shortages, you referred to for windows, doors, millworks \u2013 millwork. Is that something \u2013 I am sure it\u2019s embedded in the guidance for 2H, but in the second half, is that a major impact? And then \u2013 or is it a greater impact as you get into next year?\nPeter Jackson: Well, I mean, it\u2019s been an impact all year. I think if you \u2013 as you look at the other part of our business, right. The other part of our value-add business, windows, doors and millwork, it\u2019s trailed a little bit in terms of growth. Still strong, but not where we think it should be. A couple of pieces of that, obviously, a chunk of that is the expansion in units under construction, and it\u2019s just sort of how far along a lot of these homes are. But some of the cause of them being as \u2013 there being as many units under construction as there are, is that we have just struggled. Lead times are longer. They have been longer for, gosh, coming up on nine months plus. So, this is not new news. I think we just consistently fight it in the channel. I think it\u2019s one of those areas where we would see faster completions and faster cycling of, sort of, the growth in our market if we could relieve that. I know they are trying, but it certainly continues \u2013 I would say, in a stable way. It may be a little bit less bad than it was, but still bad.\nDave Flitman: Yes. I would say we saw a little acceleration in our organic growth there from Q1 to Q2, which kind of reflects what Peter just highlighted. But our teams are just doing a tremendous job to get product for our customers. And as I mentioned, we have heard from our builders, they have slowed starts. It\u2019s not a demand problem. The reason those starts have been slowed is exclusively because of the challenges that they have had around labor and materials. And we are doing our best to satisfy those needs on both fronts.\nSteven Ramsey: Excellent. And then last thing, lumber pricing, clearly on randomly starts coming down, but some people we talk to in-channel checks have said that lumber transactions, the pricing is not coming down on the ground. Are you seeing that in your business?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I mean we do so much commodity across the country. I would say we probably see everything in one place or another. I think speculating on commodity prices and what it\u2019s going to do is, in our world, something where \u2013 it\u2019s a bit of a fool\u2019s errand, as demonstrated by my forecast last quarter. So, I think we will just maybe leave that along.\nSteven Ramsey: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will take our next question from Stanley Elliott.\nStanley Elliott: Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you all for taking the question and congratulations. Could you talk a little bit more about the Alliance acquisition? If I remember correctly, they didn\u2019t do a whole lot of value-add millwork like you all do. What\u2019s the opportunity set here for you all to put that through their channel and how quickly can you realize that?\nDave Flitman: Yes. We are excited about that. I made a couple of comments there in the script about that as an opportunity. We had a relatively small footprint in the states, as you know, half a dozen or so locations. They have got great capability on the component side, which we are excited about, but they have not had the millwork opportunity, and we are very strong in millwork, as you know. And so we will see how quickly we can get that ramped up. The team is excited about it, both the Alliance team as well as our team. And we will get after that one as quickly as we can. There is obviously a clear need in that market, given the growth that they are experiencing. And so we are excited about that.\nStanley Elliott: In M&A, you have always did a very nice job of rolling up markets. Does the shortage in some of the materials that you are seeing now, does that change your thought process on maybe moving into, maybe adding some capacity on the value-added side versus consolidating some of the smaller dealerships?\nDave Flitman: I don\u2019t think it materially changes it. And we are doing both. We are investing quite heavily in capabilities on value added, both in the millwork side and the component side as we see a long runway there of adoption and growth in the markets. And we are still looking in the markets to understand where it makes sense for us to augment our capability through the right M&A, which may help us expand our geographic footprint in the local market. And so as we have talked about both on our capital allocation and just our overall strategy, we are going to continue to do both.\nPeter Jackson: And just to add on to that, one thing that\u2019s exciting in some of these opportunities is that we have got the efficiency, the skill sets to help them improve their performance to get more out of these businesses that they are managing. So, I think that adds to our ability to meet the capacity constraints in the market. And as far as being there for our customers, we certainly believe that increased scale and the partnerships that, that helps to create in the long run with vendors is certainly \u2013 it\u2019s advantageous to us and puts us in a position to get, at least if not more than our fair share, as we deal with typical supply environment.\nStanley Elliott: Great guys. Thank you very much and best of luck.\nDave Flitman: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: Hi. Thanks guys. And yes, I wanted to echo on the deck as well, super helpful. But my question, I guess first off, is the follow-up back on one of the earlier ones around the base business EBITDA margins. And clearly, the incrementals are running high-teens I think you did 10.4 this quarter. And like you said, David, obviously, there is potential for some upside here. But Dave, where do you see this base business margin opportunity over time as you look at all the moving pieces? Clearly, it\u2019s higher. But with these types of incrementals, where could we see this going over time?\nDave Flitman: Yes. We are excited about it. We think both the top and the bottom line will continue to grow over time. We are not going to project that this morning, Trey. But I will promise you we are absolutely focused on it. That is the focus of this company right now, our base business our value-added capabilities. We are going to grow it. We are going to continue to improve profitability, and we are going to invest in it.\nTrey Grooms: Alright. Fair enough. I thought it was worth a shot. And then \u2013 and then, Peter, a minute ago, you mentioned some of the dynamics that we have come to understand over the years with lumber price fluctuations, where this most recent spike in lumber, you guys had kind of bucked the trend. It hasn\u2019t been your normal kind of reaction as far as the \u2013 to the gross margin percentage. So \u2013 and you mentioned that when things move widely \u2013 or wildly quickly, that the margin can react differently, almost the opposite of what we see in a more normal kind of lumber price movement kind of environment. So, with that said, is \u2013 so you guys have been really outperforming or actually seeing margins higher as a result of this spike up. So, is it the expectation per your comment earlier that it\u2019s like a decremental on the way down that we should expect some kind of normalization of the gross margin just as these prices come down? Did I read that right? Excluding the core business, which obviously is the big focus in what we care about, but unfortunately, we still have to model the lumber piece, too. So \u2013 but is that kind of what you were pointing to there?\nPeter Jackson: Well, I am not signaling a downturn. I guess what I want to be upfront about, and I think we have talked about a little bit on prior calls, is the nature of those extended terms, the mix of those extended terms have materially changed. So, where there was a more extreme impact on the way up and a pretty extreme impact on the way down, right. Headwind on the margin, percentage on the way up, strong tailwind on the market, percentage on the way down, I think both of those are diminished. I think they are diminished because of the reduction in average days of price lock in our mix of sales. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s signaling a downturn into the future. I think a lot of the fall-through that we are dialing out and this analytic comes from other parts of the business and commodities and the pricing volatility, the nature of some buying that we did, all of that, all glommed together in that number. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a real big headwind for us. Anytime you have fluctuations, especially as massively as they are now, there is always a little bit of uncertainty as to how it all filters through. But based on what we are seeing in the detail, inventory levels, pricing levels, we think we can manage through it very effectively. I just wanted to sort of signal that there \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is going to be as big of a windfall as there have been in the last cycles.\nTrey Grooms: Great. Thanks for the clarity there. It appears that was perfect. And thanks again for taking the question. Keep up the good work. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Ketan Mamtora, BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: Thanks for squeezing me in and let me add my congratulations. Coming back to the value-added side of the piece, obviously, really strong results, so I am just curious, are there any particular regions or areas of the country where you are seeing more growth or is it more-broad based?\nDave Flitman: Yes. The exciting part about it is we have seen that expansion and growth broadly across all the geographies. So, there is not one that I would point to that would be outpaced strong. Obviously, the strength that we have in the South and in Texas, a kind of leads the way, but as we have gained adoption and accelerated penetration, it\u2019s really broad based.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then can you just remind us in terms of the capacity headroom that you have, both on the manufacturer side and the millwork side, particularly in light of the strong growth that you guys are seeing?\nDave Flitman: No, it\u2019s a challenge. We were spending \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, we have been spending quite a bit of capital to increase our capacity in key markets. In addition to that, we are driving productivity and efficiencies to just gain any incremental capacity that we can. I think, given the strength of the market and the adoption rate of what we are seeing. We are going to fight that for a bit, but we are not losing sales today because we can\u2019t supply. The challenge, as Peter talked about earlier, has been in some of the upfront supply chain challenges and just getting materials. We are not the bottleneck currently, but it\u2019s something that we have got to be diligent about and stay on top of.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Good luck in the back half of the year.\nDave Flitman: I appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\nDave Flitman: Good morning.\nJay McCanless: First \u2013 good morning. Given the velocity of the business now and the lower lumber prices, do you \u2013 do you think third quarter this year\u2019s gross margin is trending more towards what we saw in the first quarter, or something closer to what we saw in the second quarter? Just wondering with all the turnover and what seems to be a better outlook for multi-family on Builders FirstSource part, just wondering how quickly that change in lumber prices is going to flow through to the gross margin.\nPeter Jackson: Well, I think historically, we have talked about the timeline for the flow-through of changes in commodities, just being in that quarter-ish time line, one quarter to two quarters. So, I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say that there will be a bit of a fade. Obviously, Q2 had the lapping of the worst of COVID. We have gotten a lot of good benefits year-on-year. So, I think settling back as prices settle back over the next quarter or two quarters is still appropriate.\nJay McCanless: And then could you maybe talk about multi-family? It sounds like the demand from what\u2019s coming in has changed and you have gone to positive growth there from, I think, negative growth before. A, what\u2019s going on there? B, is this helping to offset maybe a little bit slower pace from single-family builders?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. That\u2019s been a nice, sort of surprise, a little ray of sunlight coming through in multi-family when we thought it would be pretty weak. Now just to clarify for those that maybe aren\u2019t as familiar with us, our multi-family is a pretty market specific focused business on most of the country. It\u2019s four-story and below wood structures, a couple of businesses that do quite well in the high-rise market, but they are fairly small. So, a lot of our work is project focused. I think what you see is the resurgence of a little bit of that multi-family housing market as people realize that the new homes aren\u2019t going to come out of the ground as fast as people maybe would have hoped, as all of us maybe would have hoped. And those 3 million to 5 million underbuilt or underserved homebuyers are going to need some place to live until we are ready. So, I think what you are seeing is a little bit of a rebound there. It\u2019s still pretty modest, but we are certainly pleased with it because it was, as you know, pretty grim there on the outlook for a while.\nJay McCanless: Perfect. And my compliments on the new deck as well. There is a lot of good detail there. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will move on to Collin Verron with Jefferies.\nCollin Verron: Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. Most of my questions have actually been answered already. But I guess I will touch on the new leverage target. You seem to be very bullish on demand for the next several years. So, can you just tie together your bullish commentary, maybe how many more years of growth you see in the cycle with that new 1x to 2x leverage range that you put out there today?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I mean I think that it\u2019s exciting times to be in Builders FirstSource is what that blows down to. We have got we think a really strong positioning on the business in terms of what we have been able to do with the balance sheet, the long maturities, the low and declining interest rates. And we are doing it in a way that makes the business bulletproof. Our focus, our recognition is to make sure we have an incredibly strong balance sheet throughout the cycle. This is a great time in the cycle where we think that there is more runway and we are going to continue to generate cash. Our job is to put it to work and maximize the shareholder benefit, and benefit the business, make sure we are healthy and our stakeholders are satisfied and taking care of and provides a great return. And I think we are lining it up in a way that we have got a lot of firepower to do a bunch of different things. And we are going to be disciplined about how we put that to work. And the math we are doing around the return on investment for internal investments, for M&A and for potential returning of capital to shareholders is disciplined. And we are going to continue to work with the Board and management to make those decisions in the best possible way.\nCollin Verron: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next caller \u2013 question from Kurt Yinger.\nKurt Yinger: Great. Thanks and good morning everyone.\nDave Flitman: Good morning Kurt.\nKurt Yinger: Good morning. Just one quick one on the EBITDA incremental, it looks like in \u201821, on the commodities, that margin is about 20% or so. I guess the question is, as we look ahead to 2022 and make whatever assumption we want around lumber prices and the top line impact there, is that the same type of incremental margin we should be kind of looking for, presumably, on the way down or do you have any thoughts around anything you are doing internally around pricing or things like that, that could kind of dampen that impact?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So, I think the way down versus the way up comment is exactly why we did Slide 5. I think that was really our intent is to help people understand where it wants to be when commodity prices are at that $400. So, I think that\u2019s a really healthy way to look at it. I just remind everybody how dynamic this year has been, how volatile. I mean these words coming from the guy who thought we were going to descend gently from our roughly $900 or $1,000 commodity levels back when the last time we met on this call. It\u2019s been a heck of a ride since. And I think what you are seeing in these numbers is a lot of the impact of that volatility in one way, shape or form. So, that expectation of it going back to the 15.3 and the $1.6 billion number for \u201821, we really wanted you to have that just to give you a sense of what we think the base business really looks like. And hopefully, that answers your question appropriately.\nKurt Yinger: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess just one higher level question. I mean you are still relatively early in the process of combining the business and a lot of things are going very well. I am just curious from a pure scale perspective and the relationships you have with your suppliers and your customers, which positive areas of the business that you are seeing right now, do you feel like have really been augmented by that increased scale, putting together BMC and BFS?\nDave Flitman: Yes. Now, I am thrilled about a lot of things, but the results that you are seeing in the value-added areas of the business. As I said earlier, were exactly what we envisioned and hope for, and it\u2019s great to see that playing out. Our organization is focused on it. We are continuing to provide innovation. We are continuing to invest in that part of the business. And as I said, we have got a long, long runway ahead of us.\nPeter Jackson: Yes, I don\u2019t think any of us have that forecasted number of 58%...\nDave Flitman: In growth.\nPeter Jackson: Right. So, the ability of the team to be put together like they have been and execute at that level, it\u2019s really amazing, it\u2019s awesome.\nDave Flitman: The cultural alignment has been fantastic.\nKurt Yinger: Okay, alright. Well, I appreciate all the color guys and good luck here in the back half.\nDave Flitman: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. And lastly we will take Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.\nRyan Gilbert: Hi. Thanks guys.\nDave Flitman: Good morning.\nRyan Gilbert: First question is \u2013 good morning. First question on manufactured products, I think over the last couple of quarters, we have talked about the growth on \u2013 the core organic growth in the manufactured products segment being driven primarily by existing customer relationships. And I am wondering as we move into the peak building season here, and the really strong core organic growth you put up in 2Q, if you are seeing the customer base expand from the last couple of quarters. And then just \u2013 if that has been the case, your thoughts on the stickiness of that new customer base and how that influences your thoughts around normalized gross margin if we can do better than 26 to 26.5?\nDave Flitman: Yes. I mean, very good question. And as I have just said, that clearly is the focus of the organization in our value-add. We have seen great adoption. I think I commented earlier that we are seeing really good adoption with customers who have had experience with our value-added capabilities in one geography or another, or maybe a few and are gaining more confidence based on what they have seen in those markets around what our value-added capability can do \u2013 can do to help them both with labor challenges and drive outpaced efficiencies at the job site. So, we see a long runway here over time. And the other thing I would say and I think I said this in my prepared remarks, a disproportionate amount of the new homes being constructed are those starter homes, and that lends itself very well to the structural design work that we do in our components business. And so given all that backdrop and the focus that we have on it, we will continue to see the adoption increase.\nRyan Gilbert: Okay, great. Second question is on multi-family. I know legacy BMC had a really nice multi-family operation that flowed through \u2013 or complemented the millwork, doors and windows segment of their business. And as we see multi-family start to rebound, I am wondering the extent that you have been able to take the legacy BMC multi-family operation and expand it to the entire pro forma business?\nDave Flitman: Yes. Let me just comment and I will flip it over to Peter here for any additional color. You are right to portray the focus that we had at BMC being very strong. But I would highlight what Peter said earlier, even in the BMC legacy footprint, it was a very targeted approach to multi-family and key markets in the South, a little bit up in the East and somewhat out in California and the West Coast. It was not broad based. And I think that our targeted market focus is exactly why we had such success. We knew where those markets were going to be strong for some period of time, and that\u2019s where we had the capability. And our team was just fantastic at driving growth.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. And I think that the combined multi-family business has done well. I think they have partnered well and are seeing strong performance. What we consider to be taking market share, it\u2019s a little hard to communicate that and we are talking about comparisons to national metrics. But we think we are doing really well with that business. Anybody who has the background in the multi-family recognizes the longer cycle times on those projects, cycle times that are particularly disrupted by extremely volatile commodity prices. So, there has been \u2013 it\u2019s been \u2013 of all the markets they have been as active as anybody. But we certainly are still very pleased with the performance of that business, both top and bottom line.\nRyan Gilbert: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Michael Neese for any additional or closing remarks.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Sarah and thank you everyone for your time and interest in BFS. We are around all day to take your questions. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Our record second quarter and first half earnings are the result of the hard work and strong execution by our more than 26,000 team members who have been relentless in providing superior customer service amid robust demand in a very tight supply environment. I want to start by thanking them as I couldn't be more proud of their efforts. In the second quarter, we delivered core organic sales growth above 35%, along with record gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and margin. Our performance accelerated in the second quarter as we continued to expand our value-added offerings, executed disciplined pricing strategies and accelerated merger-related integration savings. I will cover three key topics on today's call. First, I'll provide an update on the residential housing environment, which remains very strong, review our second quarter results and given the unique demand and supply dynamics, share some insights into the strength of the underlying growth in our base business. Second, I'll provide an update on our recent M&A transactions that further strengthen our market position and advance our digital strategy and highlight our very strong pipeline of potential tuck-in acquisitions. And finally, I'll provide an update on the BMC integration, which is progressing exceptionally well and running ahead of plan. Let me start with the current state of the residential housing environment. we continue to see strong demand across the country. Specifically, single-family housing demand is robust and our entire supply chain is working hard to keep up with that strength. Regardless of short-term fluctuations, we believe the nation's homebuilding sector is growing today, and there is sustained growth in store for the next several years. Freddie Mac stated earlier this year that the U.S. is underbuilt by approximately 4 million homes. The National Association of Realtors believes we are 5.5 million homes underbuilt. Whichever number you believe, there is a significant shortage of housing in this country that will take many years of above normal starts to overcome. According to the NAHB's second quarter 2021 housing trends report, almost 20% of American adults are considering the purchase of a home within the next year. This statistics have increased for 5 consecutive quarters and is nearly double to 10% in Q1 of 2020. Additionally, 64% of these potential buyers are first-time buyers, which is the highest share in history. The millennial generation, some 82 million strong, will continue to provide support and growth in new housing construction for many years. There is also an extremely tight supply of existing homes for sale. We have averaged 1.1 million units of inventory in 2021, which is 20% below the 5-year average and well below the high of 3.5 million units of inventory in 2007. This data further supports our strong belief in the need for new home construction. Single-family starts increased 41.7% in the second quarter, which we outpaced by approximately 240 basis points with our single-family core organic growth. In addition, adjusting for the effects of the pandemic in the second quarter of last year, single-family starts this quarter grew 27% when compared with the second quarter of 2019. Housing under construction also increased 29% in the second quarter. There are now 439,000 more single-family homes under construction than there were at this time last year, and 396,000 more than at the same time in 2019. Some industry observers are racing to call at the top of the cycle, but the data tells us there will likely be continued strong momentum in new home construction, which will bode well for us and the industry as a whole. Recently, we've heard from several of our homebuilder customers that they are tapping the brakes on starts for a few reasons, namely labor, material and land availability, even though demand remains strong. These challenges, coupled with the growth we've seen in the first half of the year, suggests builders are exceeding their growth forecast for this year and are pushing some new home construction into next year, supporting our belief that growth will continue for some time. And our 58% core organic growth in our Structural Components business, underscores our belief that our value-added offerings will be increasingly important to builders as they continue to navigate material and labor challenges and look for ways to get more efficient. Housing starts showing significant growth, mortgage rates remaining at historical lows and a continued shift to homeownership are all significant tailwinds. As a reminder, we are in 84 of the largest and fastest growing MSAs in the country. Our team is poised to continue to capture a disproportionate share of the growth as we have done for the past several years and as evidenced by our most recent 260 basis point outperformance over the last 6 months. I am confident we will outperform the market in any environment. And what we are experiencing now is exactly what we envisioned when we put our merger together. A best-in-class operation located in the top markets in the country, focused on serving customers with the best portfolio of products and services and solving their construction challenges. We have a seasoned, cycle-tested management team, and we are just getting started. Now let's turn to our record second quarter results. We delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line performance and importantly, core organic growth of 44.1% in our single-family segment and 58% in manufactured components, again outpaced the market as we continue to gain share. Turning to Slide 4, I will review our pro forma results for the quarter. Total sales grew 91% to $5.6 billion. Core organic sales increased 35%. Gross profit expanded more than 105% and adjusted EBITDA increased a remarkable 232% to $836 million with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding by 640 basis points to a record 15%. Turning to Slide 5, we have received many questions from analysts and investors regarding the impact of commodities on our business results. In response, we are providing an overview of the underlying top and bottom line growth of our base business, on a normalized basis, assuming a static commodity price of $400 per thousand board feet. For the full year 2021 versus 2020, we expect our base business net sales to grow to $15.3 billion from $12.5 billion or 22% and adjusted EBITDA to grow to $1.6 billion from $1.1 billion or 45%. Given consistent single-family starts, we believe our 10.1% EBITDA margin on our base business is sustainable and can grow over time, as evidenced by our 240 basis points of growth since 2019. That's a 31% improvement in profitability in 2 years. Peter will go into further detail in his prepared remarks, but I want to point out to everyone that our base business is large, it's growing, and it has a sustained double-digit EBITDA margin profile. Now, let me spend a bit of time on M&A and our recently announced transactions, Alliance Lumber, which closed on July 1 and Paradigm for which we signed a definitive purchase agreement in late June. Turning to Slide 6, Alliance Lumber is the largest supplier of building materials in Arizona, primarily serving the fast-growing greater Phoenix, Tucson and Prescott Valley metropolitan areas. The Phoenix Metro area alone is expected to add more than 100,000 jobs in 2022, so we're excited about our increased presence in the state. Arizona is the number three ranked single-family MSA in the U.S., encompassing the nation's fastest growing county, Maricopa. This acquisition is aligned with our strategy of investing organically and through M&A to grow our portfolio of high-value and faster growth categories. Alliance has an estimated 45% market share with the top homebuilders and catapults us to a leading position in the state. Its geographic footprint and component manufacturing capability is an excellent strategic fit. And the limited overlap of our existing coverage enables us to expand our product offerings into previously untapped regions. Alliance is margin accretive and we have an opportunity to embed our millwork capability into their operations. With deep, longstanding customer relationships and a reputation for offering outstanding customer service, Alliance is an established and trusted adviser to leading homebuilders and contractors across single-family, multifamily and commercial end markets. Founder and CEO of True Carr and his team have built a fantastic company with strong leadership and values that align to our own in a similar culture of growth. We are thrilled to have the Alliance team members as part of the BFS family. Now turning to Slide 7, I want to spend a few minutes on our strategy and recent M&A in the digital space, which has been a priority and focus for us over the last several years. Based on third-party research, the homebuilding market is lagging almost every other industry in digital transformation. As the new generation of builders emerges, a generation that grew up with digital technologies, which has accelerated given the impacts of COVID, we are seeing a shift in how our customers want to do business. And we see this trend having a long tail as adoption accelerates. Digital is a significant growth opportunity for BFS as the industry goes through a shift to digital execution. Given the scale of our platform, we feel we are well positioned to help shape important outcomes for our industry, including improved efficiencies and productivity through digital technologies. Our digital strategy includes three main areas: first, a focus on our internal processes and productivity by investing in technology to drive operational efficiency and excellence; next, help streamline interactions with our vendors and customers; and finally, a focus on external innovation and investment to offer value-added digital products and services that support our customers' success and growth. On June 29, we announced a major step forward in our digital strategy with our intent to acquire Paradigm, an innovative software solutions company that is transforming the way new construction and renovation this time. Over the past 20 plus years, Paradigm has grown to over 300 employees, serving more than 250 customers spanning homebuilders, lumber yards, manufacturers, retailers and distributors with an expanding list of 70,000 end users. From home visualization to material takeoff technology to drafting services and estimating, Paradigm software platform helps increase sales and operational efficiencies for new construction and renovation businesses. The addition of Paradigm offers several compelling strategic benefits to Builders FirstSource. Specifically, we will scale Paradigm's platform from the current 250 customers to our broader base of 70,000 customers. Paradigm's platform will help us drive internal productivity in our team of over 700 designers and estimators. Paradigm provides another value-added capability to reduce inefficiencies and costs for our homebuilder customers, strengthening our current partnerships. And finally, and most impactfully, we believe we can capture more than $1 billion of incremental sales over the next 5 years by utilizing our digital assets to accelerate the adoption and capture rates of value-added products. To be clear, neither Alliance nor Paradigm signal a change in our M&A strategy. We will continue to reinvest in our business while actively pursuing accretive tuck-in M&A opportunities to improve our mix and build scale in key growth markets. As you can see on Slide 11, we have identified more than 460 targets in the $15 million to $100 million revenue range. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation will allow us to be a disciplined consolidator in this industry for a long time to come. Finally, I'd like to update you on the BMC integration, which is going very well. Synergies are tracking 1 year ahead of plan and are projected to exceed our initial expectations. Through the second quarter of this year, we have already captured $36 million in cost savings. Based on our progress to-date, we are increasing our synergy targets. Specifically, we are raising our year one 2021 projected savings to between $80 million and $100 million from the $60 million to $70 million we had previously communicated and now, we expect to achieve total synergies of between $140 million to $160 million by the end of 2022, allowing us to overachieve in just 2 years versus our original 3-year commitment of between $130 million to $150 million. These increased synergy targets underscore the success of the BMC integration to date. In addition, our teams are working closely together to leverage our scale and product offerings. Specifically, we've been able to create additional capacity for our component facilities in overlap markets, accelerating growth in that key category. We have also been able to use our combined relationships to divert more national builders in attractive markets, accelerating growth in structural components, READY-FRAME and our millwork offerings. These are exciting times and our outstanding results reflect the strong housing market and underlying demand for new homes. Our industry leading platform, coupled with our ability to deliver value to our customers, and a continuation of our disciplined approach to cost management and operational excellence, and we are confident in our ability to consistently execute at a very high level. In conclusion, I would like to highlight one of our many valued associates. Nothing is more important than safety of our team members here at BFS. It takes hard work and commitment to build and maintain a strong safety culture. I wanted to spotlight someone who is going above and beyond to lead that culture in her location. Kelly Rhodes is a regional safety manager in Oklahoma. She and her team invited OSHA to voluntarily visit the North Oklahoma City lumber and millwork location to further improve their safety and health program. While there, the OSHA representatives were so impressed that they gave Kelly a special OSHA commemorative coin as a token of appreciation for a successful inspection and for their outstanding training documentation. Dedicated team members like Kelly help reinforce our safety culture, and we are glad to have her on our team in Oklahoma. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q2 results and our 2021 updated financial guidance. Thanks Peter. In summary, demand in single-family housing remains exceptionally strong, and we continue to capitalize on this positive trend by ensuring we meet the needs of our customers, both today and in the future. The BMC integration continues to progress extraordinarily well, and our realization of cost synergies is a year ahead of schedule. Looking forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy of investing both organically and through M&A to continue to align our portfolio with high value and faster growth categories while simultaneously improving efficiencies, productivity and our digital capabilities in the value chain. Our future is bright, and our ability to execute and our hunger to innovate have never been stronger, and we will continue going above and beyond for our customers and partners to provide best-in-class homebuilding solutions. With that, Sarah, let's open the call for questions. Good morning, Reuben. Yes. Reuben, as I mentioned in my comments, we've been in contact with our customers quite regularly. And almost without exception, you've seen them kind of slow the starts for this year with the intent of pushing demand into next year. And almost to a person, they said this is the strongest environment they have operated in many through their careers. Given the state of the demand which is much, much different than it's been in a very, very long time, interest rates, we expect the continuation of what we've seen this year into next year. And I'd also point out, our focus on our value-added portions of our business are just continuing to gain momentum. And I said it in the script, and I'll say it again, I've got confidence in our ability to continue to drive growth and take share in any market environment. Thank you. Mike, this is Dave. We had both legacy companies, as you know, had strong underlying momentum and a strong focus on manufactured components for a long time. And both of us, we're continuing to gain share. When we put this team together, we knew, particularly in overlap markets, there will be increased opportunities for us to accelerate that growth, both internally based on what we were doing with our assets and where we saw opportunities to extend capacity, which has been very tight in some markets where we've had rapid adoption. But importantly, continuing to convert customers at a higher rate. Those new customers, what I would say more importantly and probably more impactfully, is accelerating growth with customers we've already had relationships in certain geographies and our merger helped them get more comfortable in accelerating and extending that across their footprint. Thank you. Sure. Happy Birthday, Matt. We appreciate you spending your Birthday morning with us. I think, you ought to get a bigger size piece of cake for that. Well, the internal piece \u2013 I appreciate the question \u2013 the internal piece is something internally that we feel strongly about where we can gain some efficiencies, and just we are internally today have very manual processes as we go from design to estimating for our customers. And there are two key things that are going to help us accelerate towards that $1 billion. And obviously, these are early days, and we still have a lot to figure out. And, by the way, we haven't closed the transaction yet. But in our early thinking, we see opportunities to extend their platform more broadly across our customer base, which Nathan and his team have done a great job to get the customers that they have gotten, but we just got a bigger platform in the ability to scale that. But if you think also about long-term, being able to automate our design and takeoffs and actually provide our customers with an estimate of our full capability, including our manufactured components and READY-FRAME and even further down our millwork capability, which is at the core of what Paradigm does today, we just see that ability and the ease with which we will be able to do that over the long-term, being a great value proposition for our customers and the ability to get our value-added products in front of them in a more seamless way. Yes, there is a lot in that. Let me try to unpack it a little bit, and then I'll have Peter come over the top with any further color. But I am confident in our ability to continue to expand that margin over the long haul. I think to your last question, no, I don't think there was any outsized impact based on lumber in that. And as you think about our core business, and as Peter highlighted, 43% of that today roughly is our value-added areas. With the growth that we see, the continued improvement in mix, we just accelerated our synergy capability here. We're going to capture that over the next 6 to 12 months. And in addition to that, you think about our ability to drive operational excellence in this combined company, which we're just starting to think about and get after over the long haul. We see the ability to continue to improve our margins over time. So it's a combination of growth and internal work that we see going on that will continue to enable us over the long haul to expand those margins. Appreciate, Matt. Good morning, Dave. Normal seasonality. Sure. Thank you. Yes. I would say we saw a little acceleration in our organic growth there from Q1 to Q2, which kind of reflects what Peter just highlighted. But our teams are just doing a tremendous job to get product for our customers. And as I mentioned, we have heard from our builders, they have slowed starts. It's not a demand problem. The reason those starts have been slowed is exclusively because of the challenges that they have had around labor and materials. And we are doing our best to satisfy those needs on both fronts. Yes. We are excited about that. I made a couple of comments there in the script about that as an opportunity. We had a relatively small footprint in the states, as you know, half a dozen or so locations. They have got great capability on the component side, which we are excited about, but they have not had the millwork opportunity, and we are very strong in millwork, as you know. And so we will see how quickly we can get that ramped up. The team is excited about it, both the Alliance team as well as our team. And we will get after that one as quickly as we can. There is obviously a clear need in that market, given the growth that they are experiencing. And so we are excited about that. I don't think it materially changes it. And we are doing both. We are investing quite heavily in capabilities on value added, both in the millwork side and the component side as we see a long runway there of adoption and growth in the markets. And we are still looking in the markets to understand where it makes sense for us to augment our capability through the right M&A, which may help us expand our geographic footprint in the local market. And so as we have talked about both on our capital allocation and just our overall strategy, we are going to continue to do both. Thanks. Yes. We are excited about it. We think both the top and the bottom line will continue to grow over time. We are not going to project that this morning, Trey. But I will promise you we are absolutely focused on it. That is the focus of this company right now, our base business our value-added capabilities. We are going to grow it. We are going to continue to improve profitability, and we are going to invest in it. Yes. The exciting part about it is we have seen that expansion and growth broadly across all the geographies. So, there is not one that I would point to that would be outpaced strong. Obviously, the strength that we have in the South and in Texas, a kind of leads the way, but as we have gained adoption and accelerated penetration, it's really broad based. No, it's a challenge. We were spending \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, we have been spending quite a bit of capital to increase our capacity in key markets. In addition to that, we are driving productivity and efficiencies to just gain any incremental capacity that we can. I think, given the strength of the market and the adoption rate of what we are seeing. We are going to fight that for a bit, but we are not losing sales today because we can't supply. The challenge, as Peter talked about earlier, has been in some of the upfront supply chain challenges and just getting materials. We are not the bottleneck currently, but it's something that we have got to be diligent about and stay on top of. I appreciate it. Good morning. Good morning Kurt. Yes. Now, I am thrilled about a lot of things, but the results that you are seeing in the value-added areas of the business. As I said earlier, were exactly what we envisioned and hope for, and it's great to see that playing out. Our organization is focused on it. We are continuing to provide innovation. We are continuing to invest in that part of the business. And as I said, we have got a long, long runway ahead of us. In growth. The cultural alignment has been fantastic. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Yes. I mean, very good question. And as I have just said, that clearly is the focus of the organization in our value-add. We have seen great adoption. I think I commented earlier that we are seeing really good adoption with customers who have had experience with our value-added capabilities in one geography or another, or maybe a few and are gaining more confidence based on what they have seen in those markets around what our value-added capability can do \u2013 can do to help them both with labor challenges and drive outpaced efficiencies at the job site. So, we see a long runway here over time. And the other thing I would say and I think I said this in my prepared remarks, a disproportionate amount of the new homes being constructed are those starter homes, and that lends itself very well to the structural design work that we do in our components business. And so given all that backdrop and the focus that we have on it, we will continue to see the adoption increase. Yes. Let me just comment and I will flip it over to Peter here for any additional color. You are right to portray the focus that we had at BMC being very strong. But I would highlight what Peter said earlier, even in the BMC legacy footprint, it was a very targeted approach to multi-family and key markets in the South, a little bit up in the East and somewhat out in California and the West Coast. It was not broad based. And I think that our targeted market focus is exactly why we had such success. We knew where those markets were going to be strong for some period of time, and that's where we had the capability. And our team was just fantastic at driving growth."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. I want to thank all of our team members for delivering incredible results. Your execution is rock solid. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I will review our second quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior year quarter. Second, I will discuss our financial position, supported by a strong operating cash flow. And third, I will provide some color on our guidance raise for the full year 2021. Starting with our Q2 results, we had net sales of $5.6 billion for the first quarter, which increased approximately 91% compared to the combined pro forma prior year period. Turning to Slide 13, value-added core organic sales increased by 35% led by 58% growth in our manufactured products category and 17% growth in our windows, doors and millwork category. Commodity price inflation benefited net sales by 52% and acquisitions contributed 3.5%. We experienced stronger than expected demand in Q2 single-family starts across the country, and we were well positioned to support this demand and take market share. Our Q2 gross profit of $1.6 billion increased 105% year-over-year, while our gross margin expanded 210 basis points to 28.4%, above our stated more than 26% long-term target, primarily driven by disciplined cost and pricing management and a dynamic supply-constrained marketplace. SG&A was $902.9 million, an increase of approximately $324 million compared to the combined pro forma prior year period, driven primarily by expenses related to the BMC merger and other acquisitions, including intangible amortization and onetime charges. Variable compensation was also higher due to the increase in net sales and profitability. Excluding acquisition-related onetime charges, underlying SG&A increased by 18.9%. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 360 basis points to 16.2% due to higher sales and continued expense control. Adjusted EBITDA increased 232% to $835.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 15%, an increase of 640 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro forma period, driven primarily by higher sales at strong margins and cost management, including synergy savings. In Q2, adjusted EPS was $2.76 per share compared to combined pro forma of $0.64 a share in the prior year period. The 331.3% increase was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, offset by higher tax and higher SG&A expenses due in part to the normalization of COVID expense costs. Adjusted EPS excludes amortization and onetime expenses related to merger and acquisition activity. Let's turn to cash flow. Our second quarter operating cash flow was an outflow of $3.3 million and free cash was an outflow of $56 million, primarily due to the impact of commodity inflation on working capital. Turning to Slide 15, at the end of the second quarter, our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 1x. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2027 and our total liquidity was approximately $750 million, providing us with significant financial flexibility. Last month, we successfully completed an opportunistic offering of $1 billion of aggregate principal amount of 4.25% unsecured senior notes due in 2032, further strengthening our balance sheet. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the credit facility with remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. Our strong second quarter and first half performance are the result of superior execution from our field teams. They are meeting the demands of the strong market momentum while delivering excellent service to our customers. While the impact of increased commodity costs is evident in our results, our structural focus remains on profitable growth in our base business. As Dave mentioned, our base business EBITDA is expected to grow 45% this year. We will continue to focus on growing the higher-margin specialty and value-add products and services in our portfolio. At the $400 per thousand commodity level, our value-added mix is roughly 43% of our total sales. From 2019 to 2021, our base business net sales are projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 15.4%, while our EBITDA is projected to grow 32%. That exceptional base growth is expected to be further augmented by commodity tailwinds. In the appendix of the investor presentation on Slide 20, we've also provided a sensitivity analysis with various commodity cost assumptions and the corresponding profits if you assume static commodity prices at those levels. Please keep in mind that shorter-term price fluctuations can result in materially different results than in a static commodity environment. Most importantly, the base business perspective provides a sharper view of our run rate regardless of where commodity prices ultimately settle. We believe we can continue to grow our base business next year while sustaining a double-digit EBITDA margin. Let's turn to our 2021 full year outlook on Slide 16. Our differentiated platform is delivering above-market growth and strong results, which we expect to continue. We are seeing strong underlying demand in both new housing construction and remodel. As we anticipated, builders are seeing such strong demand that they are limiting sales in certain communities to maintain backlogs at prudent levels, given material and labor constraints. Based on our stellar first half performance, our positive conversations with customers, our accelerated integration synergy capture, a better view of our inflation environment and our continued strong organic sales through July, we are increasing our full year 2021 outlook. We expect net sales in the range of $18 billion to $19 billion representing growth of approximately 41% to 48% over 2020 combined pro forma net sales of $12.8 billion. This is driven by an increase in new starts as the key catalyst for our base business growth plus the benefit of robust but receding commodity prices. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, or approximately 105% to 124% over 2020 combined pro forma adjusted EBITDA and of $1.07 billion. We expect to deliver significant free cash flow over the next 6 months based on normal seasonal flows, declining commodity prices and an active working capital management. Our 2021 free cash flow guidance increases by $100 million to approximately $1.5 billion as increased EBITDA is partially offset by higher working capital from higher sales as well as higher taxes and interest. Our outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release, including: mid to high teen percentage growth in single-family starts; our R&R growth in the low to mid-single digits; and multifamily starts growth in the high single digits. As discussed earlier, our commodity assumption provides an 18% to 28% lift to our base business sales growth. Commodity costs have come down over the past several months, and we expect OSB in particular to continue to come down, during which time, we will remain vigilant as we sell through our higher commodity cost materials. Despite the commodity price volatility, we feel confident in hitting our full year guidance. As Dave mentioned, the integration with BMC is ahead of our initial expectations. We now expect to deliver cost synergies of $80 million to $100 million this year. And in addition, we remain focused on accelerating our operational excellence initiatives. Turning to capital allocation, since the merger of BFS and BMC 7 months ago, we have spent considerable time focused on our strategic alignment and the analysis of the best way to deliver value to our shareholders over the long-term. As a result, our priorities for balanced capital deployment are in order, maintaining a strong balance sheet, reinvesting in our business to drive growth and productivity, continuing our tuck-in M&A strategy to grow our capabilities in desirable markets across the country with a specific focus on value-added capabilities, and returning capital to shareholders as appropriate. As part of our balanced capital deployment strategy, we are setting our leverage target in the 1 to 2x range, recognizing that we will appropriately adapt that range to the economic cycle. We remain well positioned to deploy capital effectively after executing multiple value-enhancing transactions, given our robust balance sheet and strong M&A pipeline. Overall, the financial results for the first 6 months have been extraordinary. Our base business is robust, and we believe there is a long runway for growth in the years ahead. We are focusing on creating value for our stakeholders and are continuing to build our world-class distribution network founded on operational excellence and delivering exceptional value to our customers. Let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Yes. Thanks, Reuben, and great question. It's been a dynamic year for cash flow as you highlighted. We have seen an investment of over $1.1 billion year-to-date in our working capital space, right? We're not yet \u2013 while the market is certainly turning, we're not yet on burning through either the summer build of normal inventory or the higher prices that we bought through all year. So year-to-date, our free cash flow has been at use right around $300 million. We do expect to generate the remainder, so the \u2013 about $1.8 billion between now and the end of the year. We've already started to see that generation in the third quarter. Third quarter will be a very good year, as you would expect as the market turns, and still a significant amount of cash generation into the fourth quarter. So certainly see a clear line of sight of where that will take us. $1.8 billion of additional cash from now to the end of the year is certainly going to put us in a very strong position to deploy capital in ways that will benefit shareholders. So, a couple of comments, obviously, really excited about the strength of the balance sheet. Our action to put structural very favorable debt out there, the 2032 notes 4.25% unsecured is something we're very proud of. One of the agencies gave our secured notes and investment-grade rating. We certainly are proud of what we've done on the balance sheet and excited about what that means. To your point, we've put our priorities out there. I think we are excited about what the pipeline looks like for opportunities to continue to grow in M&A, but we're going to remain disciplined. We're not going to get out over our skis on valuations. We're very clear-eyed about what commodities do over time, that can't be a driver. And we think that, that pathway will certainly yield opportunities. Your comment about not having done share buybacks as a pro forma entity is absolutely correct. Both prior entities have done share buybacks. So I don't think anybody is necessarily opposed to the concept. It's more a matter of making sure we're looking at the situation each month, each quarter and making the absolute right decisions for the long term for our shareholders. So we're going to stay committed to that, and we will continue to message as things develop. Yes. So, just a little bit of color on that, Matt, we have seen a couple of, I'd call it, leakage of the impact and the acceleration of price in the marketplace into other buckets, we try to normalize for that in here. We try to look at the margins that we thought were sustainable over the long-term. We've talked in the past about sort of a normalized amount of gross margin. We try to account for that in this and allow the rest of it to slosh over into the commodity unusual pricing bucket. So I think that is an important one. And like I said, we have a lot of different ways to drive the performance of this business on a go-forward basis. And I think it's all of the above. It's that expanded value add, it's the efficiency in that more gross margin line, it's the efficiency in SG&A, a lot of operational excellence, a lot of improvements that we think we still have in front of us as we continue to solve problems for our customers and just grow. Good morning. No. Our expectation is that about roughly 70% of SG&A remains variable. That's the rule of thumb that we've used historically. I mean this is base only. So you have to sort of exclude that commodity price fluctuation component. Sure. Yes. I mean I think it's consistent with what we have said in the past about commodities. We certainly want investors and view the analyst community to have a clear understanding of how our business works. As you deal with the increases and decreases in commodities, there are certain characteristics of certain parts of the country that are impactful on the results. When you have inflation, where you've got longer fixed-price contracts, whether it be 60 days and the smaller percentage that's left that are the 90 days or 90 days plus, you inevitably will see a compression in the gross margin percentage as that inflation occurs. And then as it reverses, you'll see an expansion in the gross margin percentage. Inversely, you will also see it in markets with very, very fast pricing turns where everything is very short. Sometimes you will see the exact opposite, where you will see expanding margins on the way up and declining margins on the way down as you're pricing off a replacement in a very fast turnaround environment. By and large, we, of course, want to make sure we're turning inventory quickly so that whatever those impacts are, they happen quickly, right? They pass through very quickly. We're \u2013 and I'll reemphasize this, we're not in the game of predicting and betting on commodities. We're in the game of distributing commodities to the advantage of our broader business. And I think that our demonstrated performance historically shows that we're pretty good at it. We know how to make money in ups and downs. It's a matter of making sure you're running it in a disciplined and operationally excellent manner. Yes. So that's the attempt. That 58% excludes what we believe to be the overlap from commodities. That's actually a new note 48% in there, Keith, on Slide 5. In that footnote, you can see we sort of called out, it's about 4% of that 22% that has some exposure to commodities, as you think about the commodities are included in what we manufacture. Yes. Well, we've communicated at close. Based on our analysis of price volume mix, that's our best estimate, yes. Well, I wouldn't hesitate to say third quarter is always higher than the fourth quarter just due to normal seasonality. And I think that the impact of commodity is as it occurs. Based on a prior year comparison? I hope I know that off the top of my head. Yes. It's probably a little more weighted to Q3. Just by nature of the seasonality, it's a little bigger and the fall-through would be a little bigger in that quarter. No, it's not. It's a fairly small business in total, and the margins were below average. Well, I mean, it's been an impact all year. I think if you \u2013 as you look at the other part of our business, right. The other part of our value-add business, windows, doors and millwork, it's trailed a little bit in terms of growth. Still strong, but not where we think it should be. A couple of pieces of that, obviously, a chunk of that is the expansion in units under construction, and it's just sort of how far along a lot of these homes are. But some of the cause of them being as \u2013 there being as many units under construction as there are, is that we have just struggled. Lead times are longer. They have been longer for, gosh, coming up on nine months plus. So, this is not new news. I think we just consistently fight it in the channel. I think it's one of those areas where we would see faster completions and faster cycling of, sort of, the growth in our market if we could relieve that. I know they are trying, but it certainly continues \u2013 I would say, in a stable way. It may be a little bit less bad than it was, but still bad. Yes. I mean we do so much commodity across the country. I would say we probably see everything in one place or another. I think speculating on commodity prices and what it's going to do is, in our world, something where \u2013 it's a bit of a fool's errand, as demonstrated by my forecast last quarter. So, I think we will just maybe leave that along. And just to add on to that, one thing that's exciting in some of these opportunities is that we have got the efficiency, the skill sets to help them improve their performance to get more out of these businesses that they are managing. So, I think that adds to our ability to meet the capacity constraints in the market. And as far as being there for our customers, we certainly believe that increased scale and the partnerships that, that helps to create in the long run with vendors is certainly \u2013 it's advantageous to us and puts us in a position to get, at least if not more than our fair share, as we deal with typical supply environment. Well, I am not signaling a downturn. I guess what I want to be upfront about, and I think we have talked about a little bit on prior calls, is the nature of those extended terms, the mix of those extended terms have materially changed. So, where there was a more extreme impact on the way up and a pretty extreme impact on the way down, right. Headwind on the margin, percentage on the way up, strong tailwind on the market, percentage on the way down, I think both of those are diminished. I think they are diminished because of the reduction in average days of price lock in our mix of sales. I don't think it's signaling a downturn into the future. I think a lot of the fall-through that we are dialing out and this analytic comes from other parts of the business and commodities and the pricing volatility, the nature of some buying that we did, all of that, all glommed together in that number. I don't think it's going to be a real big headwind for us. Anytime you have fluctuations, especially as massively as they are now, there is always a little bit of uncertainty as to how it all filters through. But based on what we are seeing in the detail, inventory levels, pricing levels, we think we can manage through it very effectively. I just wanted to sort of signal that there \u2013 I don't think there is going to be as big of a windfall as there have been in the last cycles. Well, I think historically, we have talked about the timeline for the flow-through of changes in commodities, just being in that quarter-ish time line, one quarter to two quarters. So, I think that's \u2013 it's fair to say that there will be a bit of a fade. Obviously, Q2 had the lapping of the worst of COVID. We have gotten a lot of good benefits year-on-year. So, I think settling back as prices settle back over the next quarter or two quarters is still appropriate. Yes. That's been a nice, sort of surprise, a little ray of sunlight coming through in multi-family when we thought it would be pretty weak. Now just to clarify for those that maybe aren't as familiar with us, our multi-family is a pretty market specific focused business on most of the country. It's four-story and below wood structures, a couple of businesses that do quite well in the high-rise market, but they are fairly small. So, a lot of our work is project focused. I think what you see is the resurgence of a little bit of that multi-family housing market as people realize that the new homes aren't going to come out of the ground as fast as people maybe would have hoped, as all of us maybe would have hoped. And those 3 million to 5 million underbuilt or underserved homebuyers are going to need some place to live until we are ready. So, I think what you are seeing is a little bit of a rebound there. It's still pretty modest, but we are certainly pleased with it because it was, as you know, pretty grim there on the outlook for a while. Thank you. Yes. I mean I think that it's exciting times to be in Builders FirstSource is what that blows down to. We have got we think a really strong positioning on the business in terms of what we have been able to do with the balance sheet, the long maturities, the low and declining interest rates. And we are doing it in a way that makes the business bulletproof. Our focus, our recognition is to make sure we have an incredibly strong balance sheet throughout the cycle. This is a great time in the cycle where we think that there is more runway and we are going to continue to generate cash. Our job is to put it to work and maximize the shareholder benefit, and benefit the business, make sure we are healthy and our stakeholders are satisfied and taking care of and provides a great return. And I think we are lining it up in a way that we have got a lot of firepower to do a bunch of different things. And we are going to be disciplined about how we put that to work. And the math we are doing around the return on investment for internal investments, for M&A and for potential returning of capital to shareholders is disciplined. And we are going to continue to work with the Board and management to make those decisions in the best possible way. Yes. So, I think the way down versus the way up comment is exactly why we did Slide 5. I think that was really our intent is to help people understand where it wants to be when commodity prices are at that $400. So, I think that's a really healthy way to look at it. I just remind everybody how dynamic this year has been, how volatile. I mean these words coming from the guy who thought we were going to descend gently from our roughly $900 or $1,000 commodity levels back when the last time we met on this call. It's been a heck of a ride since. And I think what you are seeing in these numbers is a lot of the impact of that volatility in one way, shape or form. So, that expectation of it going back to the 15.3 and the $1.6 billion number for \u201821, we really wanted you to have that just to give you a sense of what we think the base business really looks like. And hopefully, that answers your question appropriately. Yes, I don't think any of us have that forecasted number of 58%... Right. So, the ability of the team to be put together like they have been and execute at that level, it's really amazing, it's awesome. Yes. And I think that the combined multi-family business has done well. I think they have partnered well and are seeing strong performance. What we consider to be taking market share, it's a little hard to communicate that and we are talking about comparisons to national metrics. But we think we are doing really well with that business. Anybody who has the background in the multi-family recognizes the longer cycle times on those projects, cycle times that are particularly disrupted by extremely volatile commodity prices. So, there has been \u2013 it's been \u2013 of all the markets they have been as active as anybody. But we certainly are still very pleased with the performance of that business, both top and bottom line."

With that I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Flitman: Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. The positive momentum in our business continued with our record first quarter results. I very much appreciate the efforts of our more than 26,000 team members who are working tirelessly to provide best-in-class service for our customers in these unprecedented market conditions. They continue to grow our business while meeting the needs of our customers in a highly constrained supply environment. We are working closely with our customers and suppliers to reduce cycle-times amid material availability constraints and capitalize on our nation's very strong demand for single-family residential housing. And in that context, the power of our platform is evident as we are seeing rapid growth across all product lines and I could not be more pleased with our team's results. I'll cover five important topics on today's call; first, the positive macro and residential housing environment; second, our record first quarter results and what drove our out-performance; third, our excitement about how we think about our core business and a brief word on commodities; fourth, an update on our latest acquisition and the strength of our M&A pipeline; and finally, an update on the integration of BMC, which is running ahead of our plan. I'd like to take just a minute and share why I remain bullish on our industry and our company. First, let's look at residential housing. According to Freddie Mac the US housing market is 3.8 million single-family homes short of what is needed to meet the country's demand, representing a 52% increase in the nation's home shortage compared with 2018. The gap has widened significantly over the past two years as builders have struggled to keep up with demand in part due to labor and material supply constraints. These challenges play to our strengths including our structural component and value-added offerings. In recent years we have seen accelerating success in these areas and we believe there remains a tremendous opportunity for demand and demographically fueled growth ahead of us. In terms of demand, according to the US Census Bureau, total housing starts jumped 19.4% in March to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.74 million. The National Association of Home Builders reported that this is the fastest pace for combined single-family and multifamily construction in 15 years. There were only about one million existing homes for sale at the end of February, a nearly 30% drop compared with February 2020. That is the largest annual decline ever and the lowest supply on record. This should bode well for a strong construction pace of new housing starts as we move into the summer season. Improving housing starts, historically low mortgage rates, and a shift towards single-family living are all positive trends that remain tailwinds for our products and services. We now operate in 47 of the top 50 and 86 of the top 100 MSAs. Many of which are not only among the largest, but also some of the fastest-growing MSAs in the country. Our ability to manufacture and assemble structural components at our offsite facilities provides an integrated one-stop solution that helps solve the most challenging needs for our customers; labor availability and job site productivity. As a result of this area of strength and innovation, we expect to continue to outpace market growth for many years to come. Now, let's turn to our record first quarter results. We delivered another very strong top and bottom-line quarter and importantly our organic growth again outpaced the market as we continue to gain market share. On slide three of our investor deck, on a combined basis for BFS and BMC, total sales grew 54% to $4.2 billion. Our core organic sales growth increased 22%. Gross profit increased more than 50% and adjusted EBITDA increased an impressive 187% to $455 million. These record results reflect the favorable housing market, our industry-leading position, our ability to deliver value, and a continuation of our disciplined approach to cost management. We firmly believe our core organic sales growth is sustainable for the long-term and we are positioned for outperformance through economic cycles. We have received questions from analysts and investors over the past quarter about commodities wondering what our underlying growth would look like in recent years if we normalized the commodity side of our business. Holding commodities flat at $400 per 1,000 board feet, our estimates show we have outpaced market growth by 20% from 2018 through 2020 resulting in a roughly 8% revenue CAGR. And that momentum continues to accelerate in the first quarter of this year. Yet another way we have consistently demonstrated our ability to far outperform the market and take advantage of our differentiated product platform.  Now, as a combined entity, we have the geographical presence and even stronger platform to further advance our strategy. Turning to M&A, we announced today that we closed on our most recent acquisition earlier this month, John's Lumber, a premier building materials supplier serving the largest housing market in Michigan. The acquisition provides enhanced scale that will benefit our existing 14 locations in the State. The company generated approximately $49 million in net sales for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st 2021. We're excited to welcome the John's Lumber team members to the BFS family. With our very strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation, we will continue to reinvest in our business while actively pursuing M&A opportunities. As you can see on slide 5, we have identified over 500 targets and we will continue to be a consolidator in this industry for a long time to come. Finally, I'd like to update you on the BMC integration. Our efforts are ahead of schedule and we remain highly confident in achieving three-year cost synergies of $130 million to $150 million. For 2021, we expect to meet or exceed $60 million to $70 million in realized savings. We saw merger-related cost savings begin to accumulate in the first quarter and are accelerating in the second quarter. We continue to drive our internal operating system, which will allow us to accelerate productivity, improve processes and continue to grow our margins, while servicing our customers more competitively. We believe we can continue to help offset cost escalation with our offsite manufacturing processes and other value-added products including trusses, millwork, wall panels and ready-frame. We are also seeing positive momentum in our growth efforts, as our teams work together to leverage our scale and product strengths. The early returns are reflected in our exceptional first quarter results. These are exciting times and we are continuing to build our world-class home building distribution platform that positions us as a partner of choice. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I would like to highlight one of our many value team members. May is military appreciation month. Throughout the month, Builders FirstSource is celebrating our many veterans and profiling several of their success stories. One such story focuses on Jason Bennett, the General Manager of our De Pere, Wisconsin lumber location. He joined BFS five years ago, after serving for 23 years in the US army. As a First Sergeant, Jason was responsible for 200 soldiers. He ensured their safety, welfare and training while on active duty roles. And he learned key management skills that would last long after his military career. When it was time to retire from the military, Jason looked for a company that shared the values instilled in him by the army. And he found that in Builders FirstSource. Jason joined BFS as a delivery manager in Colorado Springs and immediately fit right in. He worked his way up to operations manager and then general manager. He led his team in adopting new logistics technologies, specifically our delivery and dispatch management system and was able to increase delivery efficiency by 20%. Jason is now a general manager in Wisconsin where he focuses on the safety of his team members and customers. His location continued as accident-free street and recently hit four years without a single recordable incident. We are proud to be a place where veterans feel valued and where their skills and experience translate into a rewarding civilian career. We're grateful for veterans like Jason and how they've served our country and are pleased to have them as part of the BFS family. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q1 results and our 2021 updated financial guidance.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I too would like to thank all of our team members for delivering fantastic results in this unprecedented environment. Your focus and execution is frankly, incredible. I'll cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our combined first quarter results compared to the pro forma results from the prior year quarter. Then, I'll discuss our free cash flow and strong balance sheet. And finally, I'll provide updated guidance on the markets and our forecasted results for full year 2021. Net sales of $4.2 billion for the quarter increased 54.1% compared to the combined pro forma prior year period. Value added core organic sales increased by 22% led by 41.5% growth in our manufactured products category and 7% growth in our windows doors and millwork category. Commodity price inflation increased net sales by 31.3% and acquisitions contributed 2.4% to net sales growth. In Q1, we experienced stronger than expected demand in single-family starts across the country. And we are well positioned to support that demand. Our strong relationships with suppliers enable us to bridge product availability constraints and our value-added products and services provide relief from labor shortages. Our Q1 gross profit of $1.1 billion was an increase of 52.1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 25.6% was slightly better than expected but decreased 40 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a one-time purchase accounting adjustment. In light of the dramatic increase in costs this year, especially in commodities, I am pleased with our performance driven by the disciplined execution of our procurement and sales teams. SG&A increased 35.3% in the quarter, driven primarily by higher variable compensation related to the increase in profitability as well as depreciation and amortization and one-time charges, primarily related to the BMC merger. Excluding these variables, underlying SG&A decreased by 2.6%. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 270 basis points to 19.7% and it cost leverage on higher sales and continued strong expense controls, which more than offset higher variable costs. Adjusted EBITDA increased 187% to $455.2 million, driven by strong demand in single-family new constructions, commodity price inflation and cost leverage. Our adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 10.9%, which was up 500 basis points compared to 5.9% in the same combined pro forma period a year ago. Leverage on sales along with cost management and early synergies drove margin expansion. Core organic value-added product sales were especially impactful due to its rapid growth and higher average margins. We are in the early innings of our cost synergies and pricing opportunities. And we are accelerating our synergy capture and leveraging our combined capabilities. Let's turn to our first quarter cash flow, which was an outflow of $237 million due to our normal seasonal timing of working capital. In the quarter, we used $200.5 million in operating activities, primarily related to investments of over $500 million in networking capital. At the end of the first quarter, our pro forma net debt ratio was approximately 1.2 times our LTM adjusted EBITDA. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2027. And our total liquidity was approximately $1.1 million providing us with significant financial flexibility. Our strong first quarter results are a testament to our category-leading team and product portfolio, meeting the demands of the strong market momentum. While the impact of increased commodity costs is evident in our results, what is most important to us is that we continue to generate exceptional and sustained growth in our core business with a strong margin profile. The focus of our business is in higher margin, specialty and value-added products and services. Our portfolio of efficient problem solving products such as trusses and millwork continues to grow faster than the overall market. These specialty and value-added products and services have improved our margins over the years, as we help our customers solve labor availability, speed of construction and quality challenges on the job site. And as we have continued to consolidate the industry, we have created a consistent trend of improving operations and driving above market growth, while delivering accelerating EBITDA fall through. We have clearly created a competitively differentiated platform that can drive above-market growth, accelerate that growth with M&A and deliver fantastic bottom line results in any market environment. Let's turn to our 2021 full year outlook. We continue to see strong underlying demand in both new housing construction and remodeling. As we anticipated, builders are seeing such strong demand, that they are limiting sales in certain communities to keep from increasing backlogs due to material and labor availability constraints. Consistent with our first quarter results, our strong organic sales continued in April. Based on our Q1 performance, our positive conversations with customers, our realized synergies with the BMC acquisition and a better view of our pricing and cost environment, we are increasing our full year 2021 outlook. We expect full year net sales to grow to a range of $16 billion to $17 billion or approximately 25% to 33% over our 2020 pro forma net sales of 12.8 billion. This is driven by an increase in single-family starts as well as record commodity prices. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion or approximately 64% to 73% over our 2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $1.07 billion. Of the $500 million increase in adjusted EBITDA guidance from last quarter, roughly half is driven by poor organic growth and share gains, while the other half is driven by higher commodity prices. As a result of that outperformance, we are increasing the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance by $550 million to $1.4 billion. Our outlook is based on several assumptions which are outlined in the earnings release including low double-digit growth in single-family starts across our geographies. High single-digit to low double-digit decline in multi-family starts and low to mid-single-digit growth in R&R. Our commodity assumption provides a five to 15% lift to our top line growth. Commodity costs remain high with recent futures trading over $1600 per thousand. While levels remain elevated so far this year, we anticipate commodity prices to normalize by the fourth quarter. For some added context if commodity prices were to stay elevated at current levels through year-end we would expect to exceed our current guidance. Turning to capital allocation, we are committed to reinvesting in the business for maintenance and growth. We are focused on increasing our capacity through our list of internal CapEx projects and we have a solid pipeline of M&A candidates. As Dave mentioned, we have already executed one bolt-on acquisition this month and we are looking at several more. We continue to assess capital allocation options in light of our accelerating cash flow. Our local field teams are focused on delivering strong core organic growth and we continue to proactively manage expenses across our distribution footprint. We will meet or exceed our cost synergy goals of $60 million to $70 million this year and also deliver on our operational excellence initiatives. Overall, we are continuing to build a world-class distribution network to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders. We have never been more excited about our strategy and our future. Let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Flitman: Thanks, Peter. With underlying demand the strongest it's been in nearly 15 years coupled with the broad-based product supply constraints and our country's continued recovery from a horrific pandemic, these truly are unprecedented times. I couldn't be more pleased or proud of how our team has responded. We delivered core organic sales growth over 20%, while also successfully managing through one of the largest mergers this industry has ever seen. We have the right strategy, we have the best team on the field and we're executing at a very high level. Our future is bright, and I'm highly confident in our ability to continue to outpace industry growth while operating in a $120 billion addressable market. Thanks for joining us today. And with that Brad let's open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question. This comes from Keith Hughes with Truist.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. Many good things in this release. I guess the one that jumps out are some of the success you've had in manufactured products. Could you talk about what went well during the quarter and what's your outlook for those products in light of this revenue guidance that you've given us?\nDave Flitman: Good morning, Keith. Thanks for the question. Yes, as you point out, we've had a lot of success in our manufacturing products and I think it goes back to the success that each company was having individually. It was part of our strategies. It was something that we focused on historically. And what we've seen over the last few years is increased penetration and adoption by the home builders, because it's solving those problems we've talked about. It helps them build the homes faster. It helps them manage the job site more effectively and just be overall more productive. And we're excited about it. As you pointed out, our organic growth and components was about double what our core organic growth was this quarter which was outstanding. We expect that will continue. We continue to see rapid adoption in these component categories. No one is better positioned than we are in terms of being able to supply the needs of our customers in this area across the country. And so, we're excited about it.\nPeter Jackson: Yes, so we've added shifts, we've added facilities and we'll continue to go down that path absolutely.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. And one other question, gross margin. You talk about the purchase accounting adjustment in the quarter, as you look within this guidance range gross margin, what would it look like for the year based on what we know today and the numbers?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, I think we're feeling pretty good about being able to hold stable. Maybe even see a little bit of tailwind, depending on the trajectory. It's a dynamic market as you know. Price increases not just in commodities, but across the board have been very impactful, but in terms of our discipline and our structure around passing through those prices, we've done a good job. I'm very proud of the team and I think we can continue to perform at this level. I think it's something we're very proud of.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Keith.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning. Well congrats on the results everyone. And I concur with the prior comments that there's a lot of good topics to discuss here. My first one will be on M&A. I think, it was notable that you included that M&A opportunities slide in your earnings presentation this morning, reminiscent of the slide you had at BMC, when you completed the acquisition of John's, which we actually thought that the integration may preclude some M&A at least further into 2021, so congrats on that as well. But my question is, how have you continued to cultivate this pipeline that you're now disclosing amidst the integration in terms of your own capacity to do so? And how does your -- does this commentary suggest potentially something more programmatic on the M&A side on the horizon? Thankl you.\nDave Flitman: Yes. Great question, Matt. Thanks for asking that one. So as you pointed out, it's been a part of our strategy in both legacy companies. And as I said on the last call and I'll say again here, this integration between VFS and BMC could not be going better. Our teams have come together extremely well. You heard our comments on the synergies. We're ramping those up. We're having great success. The teams have meshed together extremely well. And obviously, based on our first quarter results, we've stayed focused on our customers and meeting their needs, which is exactly what we needed to do. Importantly, the fourth pillar of our strategy is M&A, and we have an extremely strong balance sheet. As we've talked about, we have a relatively small overall share in a very large market. It's an important part of our strategy. We've got the wherewithal and the focus to continue to drive acquisitions and as you pointed out in my comments this morning, we're focused on it.\nMatthew Bouley: Wonderful. Okay. Well, helpful color there. And then, the second one I wanted to ask on manufactured products again, because at a high level, you would say it's not a coincidence that with framing lumber prices this extreme in the near term that may foster adoption of prefab components. My question is, is that too simplistic, or have you found that into this spring that builders are actually coming to you even more so now looking for options to address this issue and what you can do for them on the component side? And really longer term does something like this you think impact the penetration of manufactured products going forward? Thank you.\nDave Flitman: Sure. I think, what you've seen is steady adoption of these component categories over the past several years in both legacy companies. Obviously, we've got a very strong team on it. As Peter has mentioned, we've added capacity in several locations across the country. You'll continue to see us invest not only in component manufacturing, but automation of those facilities to make sure that we're meeting the demands of the marketplace and we're providing as high quality and consistent product as possible. To your question, I think the adoption continues to accelerate. Some of it is probably related to what's going on with commodities near term, but more importantly, and I think more broadly, what we're seeing is the customers that have experienced the benefits of our component offerings are adopting those more rapidly across their geographic footprint. And that's probably the greater tailwind in what we're seeing here over the near term. I do believe it's sustainable. I believe we'll continue to convert the market this way and we'll continue to invest in this category of the business.\nMatthew Bouley: Thanks, guys. Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I was wondering. So thank you for those details Dave and congrats and good luck this year.\nDave Flitman: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Thanks for taking my questions. My first question -- I'll keep probing on manufacture and the tremendous results there. If you were to run rate or analyze the levels that you're seeing today, what utilization rate would you be at across your components footprint? And can you elaborate a little bit more? You talked about adding shifts and investments. Could you kind of just refresh us or outline some of the incremental steps that you're taking if possible any sort of quantification around additional investments and plants that may or may not have changed over the past few months in terms of plans for 2021?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yes, for context, we've got well over a hundred facilities. We've opened between the combined entities around 13 over the last few years. We've continued to invest. In terms of the capacity utilization, a recent analytic on a single ship baseline would say, we were at about 75% capacity. And Mike, we've talked about this before, that's a tough description because that's not an average. So you've got some facilities that are below and some above that number, but we certainly have a really nice trajectory right now in terms of being able to leverage those new facilities, get them more fully ramped up, but also be able to do things like add second shifts which as you know, it doesn't quite double, but nearly doubles the capacity of any given facility. Also adding lines, also adding automation equipment to increase the productivity and capacity of any one of those lines, that's been the primary way that we've responded. More recently, our Riverside facility in California has come up and running. We've been able to add capacity, other facilities at a number of other facilities double-digit facilities around the country through new equipment. So certainly, it's an area that we've gotten pretty good at extracting more volumes, but at the end of the day, our forward look is absolutely adding footprint. New locations around the country, the adoption in certain markets in particular is very encouraging and we see that as a long runway of strength. Admittedly, the adoption is good, but the incremental share of how much of the home is built off site is continuing to grow and we think the trend continues to come our way with those labor costs going up, which inevitably happens in a market like this. But every time a cost goes up, those efficiency savings that we provide with manufactured products are magnified. We can save 10 board feet of waste on a particular truss. It's more meaningful at 1,600 than it is at 400.\nDave Flitman: Yeah, Peter's right on and just add an exclamation point to that. We talk about our number one priority for uses of capital would be reinvesting in our company. The first portion of that goes to maintaining our facilities and making sure our people have what they need to get our products to the customers. The second order of priority is this area our value-added capabilities and continuing to invest heavily in that area of the business.\nMike Dahl: That's great, very helpful. Second question much as I'm tempted to push you on some of your conservatism around commodities I'll switch over to the capital allocation question to your point Dave. There's, obviously, first and foremost investments for organic growth. You talked about the M&A pipeline a bit, also but if we look at your cash flow and your leverage profile you're on track to be zero-net leverage by year-end if not in a net cash position barring future M&A. And so when you look at that pipeline as impressive as it is, it seems like there's going to be plenty of excess cash flow available beyond your organic investments, beyond M&A. As you think about priorities for that use of cash and comfort level in terms of then actually implementing a plan whether it's buybacks, dividends, can you just give us a little more color or an update on how you're thinking about that? There just seems to be an awful lot of dry powder.\nDave Flitman: You're right Mike. We have a very strong position right now. Our cash flow is tremendous. We've talked in the past about wanting to maintain a fortress a bulletproof balance sheet. I think we have every reason to be confident in that right now based on what we've done and we'll continue to stay vigilant. Dave mentioned our priorities around capital allocation with regard to internal investment and expansion internally and organically but also the inorganic opportunities are certainly out there. I think it's a fair question, right. We are going to generate a tremendous amount of cash and I'm very specific when I say going to because as you see in our results now we've borrowed money this quarter so we're not sitting on cash. This is not a burning platform. We are absolutely looking at if we continue to work with our board, come up with strategies that we want to put to work in terms of putting all of our capital to work in an efficient way. We've talked in the past about being committed to retaining some level of leverage in order to maximize shareholder return. We will stay committed to that. We just don't have any new announcements today.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks for the color.\nDave Flitman: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question. This comes from David Manthey with Baird Capital.\nDavid Manthey: Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone.\nDave Flitman: Hi Dave.\nPeter Jackson: Hi Dave.\nDavid Manthey: Clearly you raised your guidance for single-family housing from high single digits to low double-digit growth and it's safe to say that you're not seeing any signs of demand destruction because of the high lumber prices I should say. And then what I'm wondering is, are there any changes in tone of the business in any other way? I'm thinking like what you're seeing in size of homes or stress on custom home to other balance sheets, or anything that's beyond the obvious here, sort of, a tangent something else we should think about as it relates to these unusually high lumber prices? \nPeter Jackson: Yeah, that's a great question. We are keeping our ear to the ground on that, because obviously we're making sure that our optimism at this point isn't misplaced. The short answer is no, the demand is tremendously strong. One of the things we said in the last call that I think was met with a little bit of skepticism is this idea that there's going to be a limit on how many homes builders can build even though there's virtually unlimited demand for those same homes. The level of announcements I don't remember, which analyst had put it out there, but 54% of home builders have announced constraining sales in some number of communities around the country. They're recognizing an inability to deliver homes at that high level. That again is really a sign of that strong demand and is far less about suppression of that demand by the level of prices as we see today. Some of these prices will normalize on their own and that's definitely a theme of ours in terms of commodities that we do expect it to normalize over time. But in the meantime, it is certainly a matter of responding to that, continuing strong demand, keeping up with those shortages around the country and staying disciplined in our management of both the flow-through to maintain our position as a premier supplier but also to maintain our management over prices and make sure we're fairly compensated for the work we're doing but strength across the board.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And then when you noted that you're adding shifts, some other companies we talked to are saying that they're competing for talent with the X-Box right now, what are your views on labor? Not so much your customers' labor situation, but your own labor in terms of your access to adding people today?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah, I think that's pretty consistent over the years. It's regional. We haven't seen widespread inability to get people the usual pockets of demand drivers, certain members of the truss manufacturing world challenging in certain areas. Now there's things you can do. Certainly we're doing well. Our profit sharing and bonuses are motivational to folks. We like our driver pay models in a lot of markets and we're continuing to enhance that certainly looking at shift differential. So there are things you can do to react in a measured way that allows you to evolve and respond depending on how the market is doing. If things pull-back, we could pull-back. But we haven't had any massive issues to date pockets here and there.\nDavid Manthey: It seems like these trends are playing to your favor, which sounds good. So thank you. Best of luck guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question. This comes from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: Thank you for the question. I want to come back to also of the value-added products that you'll have, as you look out over the next three to five years and clearly it seems like the housing backdrop is supportive, how do you think -- how do you see that mix evolving from these currents are up 42% that you have right now, and within that where do you see the most opportunity? And just related to that how does it shift your margin profile?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. So it's a great question. This is a dynamic time. This whole commodity pricing being at record levels certainly has thrown us a curveball. I would say that the mix of the business just because of the mathematical change has shifted towards commodities. It's probably roughly 50% at this point, based on the increased prices. On the long-term though, the way we see the dynamic is very similar to where we were 12 months ago. And that's that, value add continues to be an increasing part of the business over the last couple of years, at least it's been the biggest component of the business with value in specialty making up 60 plus percent of what we sold in an average year. We think that continues. We think the trend of the broader product portfolio as well as the emphasis and the dependence of the greater homebuilding market on this offsite approach, given its efficiencies, given its ability to be safer and cost less in total, we think that continues to grow. There kind of is no topside to that. We talk about BFS back, as we came out of the great recession before the Probuild merger was about 50% value add, certainly think that's an achievable goal in the long-run. But again, this is a long game we're playing.\nDave Flitman: I think what you've seen overtime is both, legacy companies had a strong emphasis on pricing, models and getting more efficient at, how we take price to the marketplace. And then, secondly, that margin profile as Peter pointed out will continue to improve, based on our penetration of value-added products which we see no end to.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. That's very helpful. And then, just one other clarification, between your prepared remarks, you kind of referenced your expectation of lumber prices kind of normalizing by the fourth quarter of 2021. Is it fair to say, kind of normalized, you're looking at something sort of in the historical average range of 400? Is that the right way to think about it? And I understand kind of, prices are very volatile, but I'm just curious at a high-level.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. That's how we think about it. That long-term average feels like the reference point that we need to continue to communicate against, recognizing that there's a displacement right now in prices, displacement in demand and supply, probably the primary issue being supply. But eventually, it'll likely go back to a more normalized long-term average that 400 range. It's really just a matter of, when. Are we right on that? We know we're not right. That's the nature of commodity forecasting. So we figured we'd give you a sustainable, consistent target to head towards, when you think about our numbers and you can adjust as you see fit in terms of your expectations of, lumber prices.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. That's very helpful. I understand it so well. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the results and the outlook guys, very impressive.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks Reuben.\nReuben Garner: Let's see. So question, manufactured products has been hit pretty, pretty hard so far question-wise, the 40 plus percent growth that you saw in the quarter versus the I think you said 7% and windows, doors and millwork. Is that just a function of, timing of, when those products are used in the job cycle? Is that just kind of showing you, how maybe there's an acceleration in use of your manufactured products or is there going to be a backlog of activity that you're going to see, kind of an acceleration in the windows and doors as you move through the year?\nDave Flitman: Yeah. Good question. I think it's twofold. I think the whole build-cycle, as we've seen completions get extended out here, because has just been extended. So it's just changed the point at which our millwork is brought into the home. And then secondly, we've talked a lot about this Reuben, the supply constraints have been hit pretty hard in the windows and door piece of the business. And we're getting what we need, but it certainly has had an impact on our growth for the near-term. We expect that it will correct here through the course of the year.\nReuben Garner: Perfect. And then, I love the comment about, kind of normalizing lumber and you guys are growing at an 8% CAGR in the last few years. What did the flow through look like on kind of a normalized basis? Is there a good way to think about that?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah -- no that's a great question. In looking at that, analysis historically, we did get kind of a better sense. And you've heard us Reuben talk about, how we've got 12% to 15% fall through is sort of our standard incremental around sales. What we've noticed in these numbers is that, the inclusion of the value add mix, the inclusion of the operational excellence has actually driven that a little better. So we're in that kind of high-teens range for the fall through related to our incrementals, when you include all of those components the growth of the business. And then specifically to point out right now, the nature of commodities and the way that the market is changed, the constraint, the velocity of everything that fall through is actually a little higher. That's probably right around 20% right now. So, pros and cons of that, certainly taking advantage of it right now, but something to think about in the long-run.\nReuben Garner: Wow. That's very helpful. Thanks guys, and congrats again on the quarter. Good luck as we move through the year.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Reuben.\nDave Flitman: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsey: Hi. Good morning. Wanted to, dig into synergies a little bit, since you're ahead of target, which is great. But maybe can you describe if that was, maybe some conservatism going in, what areas you're ahead on? And what is causing that? And then lastly there, do you see this as getting to your target synergy faster or potentially raising the total synergy target, as you make more progress?\nDave Flitman: Yeah, good question. I don't think we went into this intending to be conservative that $130 to $150 million range is solid. And we're executing very well. And as you heard me say, the teams have come together extremely well. And what I think is benefiting us or two things one is, the cultural alignment of these two legacy companies very, very similar. And then secondly, and perhaps to your question a little more importantly, is the experience that our teams have had in executing large mergers in the past. Our teams knew what to expect. We had very strong leadership that's been through this before. And we just got on with business. And so I think that's reflective of the early ramp-up that we've seen here, over the first quarter of work. We're excited about it. We can deliver more. We certainly will. But I would say, at this point, we're ahead of our plan and feeling good about the momentum.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay great. And then, last one on kind of a networking capital investment cash outflow there, would this have been a greater cash outflow without material constraints that you guys have seen and relative to the cash outflow, can't remember, if you discussed, how much of this was due to investment to get the synergies.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. From a cash outflow perspective, the investment for synergies is pretty modest. We had talked about it being in the similar 130 to 150 range for expenses that, I certainly don't think, we're going to outspend that forecast either. Yes, the investment is really just in the incremental value of the inventory that we're maintaining, the normal increase in the amount of inventory that we would maintain at our yards in order to carry the increased level of business just seasonally. And then, probably, most importantly, at the end of the day, the incremental accounts receivable that ends up on the books at these higher price levels across the board. Would we otherwise have had more, if not for the material availability constraints? I think, the answer is, unequivocally, yes. I don't know how much more. I haven't really run the math on that but certainly, there are areas around the country where it's quite difficult to get the level of inventory that we would normally have, specialty products like OSB, for example, just extremely difficult to make sure you have what you need. And while we feel like we get more than our fair share, we'd sure like more. \nSteven Ramsey: Great. Thanks for the color.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nNoah Merkousko: Thanks. This is actually Noah Merkousko for Trey and just want to say -- \nPeter Jackson: Hi, Noah.\nNoah Merkousko:  -- again congrats on the really strong results. \nPeter Jackson: Thank you. \nNoah Merkousko: So first, following up on, I guess, the answer to that last question. There's been a lot of talk of material constraints across the industry, but overall they don't really seem to be holding you back. So maybe if you could just speak to your outlook for lumber and other product availability with everything being so short and just how you're able to manage through that.\nDave Flitman: Yes. I think, to a large extent you're seeing two or three things happening right now. First of all, I think you're seeing the power and the strength of the platform that we've put together here with our unmatched geographic presence and the strength of our team. Secondly, I think, you're seeing the power of the strong relationships that we've built through both legacy companies with our suppliers. And they're doing their very best job to meet the needs that we have. And then third, I think, we have seen a shift in the marketplace where the builders, just given the significance and the broad breadth of the supply constraints, have been a little bit more brand agnostic, I think, to what they're putting into their homes, just driven in large part by the need. And then, given the access that we have to the broad base of suppliers and products, we've been able to meet those needs probably better than most. And we'd expect that to continue.\nPeter Jackson: From a forecast perspective, we've talked about the inability of the broader industry to meet the massive amounts of demand. Noah, I know you know this, but for the broader group, we've talked about the seasonal capacity availability, that the shoulder seasons, by nature, offer more opportunity for rapid percent growth. We always would have expected a far higher year-over-year percent growth in Q1, candidly Q2 because of the COVID lapping and Q4, just because summer months always are max capacity every year. So we fully expect the ability to grow on a year-over-year basis to be suppressed as we get through those summer months. But that's already accounted for in our numbers. It's nothing new, but I think it's just important to keep in mind that those off season, if you will, shoulder season type of quarters will naturally lend themselves to eye-popping percent increases.\nNoah Merkousko: Yes. That makes sense. And then, just for my follow-up, on the pre cash flow guide, how much is expected from lower commodity prices flowing through to working capital?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So, I actually feel pretty good about that forecast, regardless of whether or not prices for commodities come down or not, just because of the way the math works. If prices come down, I\u2019d spin off cash and if prices stay up I make more EBITDA. So that's a good number for us.\nNoah Merkousko: All right. Perfect. Thanks and good luck going forward.\nPeter Jackson: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So my first question, I know you all gave the growth rate on value add but what -- as a percentage of net sales for this year and last year, what was the value add percentage?\nPeter Jackson: The value add percentage for the prior year? I'm not sure I -- \nJay McCanless: Well, for this year and for the prior year.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So value-add a year ago, I want to say, was right around 40%, 41%. This year it drops to 30%. Is it in the presentation? 36%?\nDave Flitman: 36% or 37%.\nPeter Jackson: 36%, 37%. So you lose a few bits. It grew fast, but that windows, doors and millwork pulls down the average. Where you saw the shrinking of the mix was really in the R&R. Like you'd expect, right? The R&R, the multi-family, some of those other areas that just don't keep pace right now with the single-family starts businesses or products.\nJay McCanless: Got it. And then I just wanted to clarify, the builders may be slowing down some of their sales, but they're not slowing down on the backlogs, correct? It's because what we've heard is that cancellation rates are way down and that the builders still have in general a pretty heavy backlog to fill out. Is that still the case? \nDave Flitman: No question about it. They're full steam ahead.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah, those guys are full up. They're not pushing out sales because they need them. They're pushing out sales because they're full to the brim. \nJay McCanless: Okay. All right. That's all I had. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Jay.\nDave Flitman: Thank you, Jay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. \nKurt Yinger: Great. Good morning everyone.\nPeter Jackson: Good morning.\nDave Flitman: Hey, Kurt.\nKurt Yinger: I just wanted to start on commodities. How has this volatility in the current environment changed, how your customers kind of purchase a framing package? And what type of risk are you willing to take in terms of locking prices for a certain period of time?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. I don't think it's fundamentally changed how people think about purchasing. I think there's certainly a bigger emphasis on making sure that they're staying efficient, which I think lends itself to some of this offsite manufacturing product model that we sell. I think there's also a willingness to consider substitution species and material substitution. We've certainly heard a lot more about that. It's an availability game, right? You're trying to make sure as -- well as a home buyer trying to make sure you get a house. But as a home builder, you want to make sure you're able to stay on some sort of a schedule. So the expectations, the ordering ahead for us it's making sure that we have a significant percentage of our buys that's on a contractual basis. So we make sure we're getting our place in line if you will. Historically, and I know you know this Kurt is that we've maintained a goal to keep a steady flow. We are going to be in the market consistently over time at our scale and our size and our demand around the country. We don't just sit on the sidelines for any meaningful period of time. That is true now that will continue to be true. I think that maintains our relationships with the mills in a very positive way. And we will continue to make sure we're building up inventory. You've got to be in this game for the better or for worse. We've talked about it in the past in terms of the fixed-price contracts. Certainly, those contracts have shrunk in recent months and year as a percentage of our total sales, but it's still I think it's representative of the type of commitment we have to our customers that we've got the balance sheet, we've got the credit, we've got the relationships. We're your partner that you want to rely on to be able to get to what you need for you to be successful and we're committed to having inventory to do that.\nKurt Yinger: Okay. Okay. So to the extent that we were to see commodity prices roll over, you would still expect some kind of short-term benefit just from the trend in prices. Is that fair?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. But certainly less than it used to be, right. With a reduction in the amount of fixed-price contracts, you'll see less suppression on the way up and less expansion in the way down of the gross market percent. \nKurt Yinger: Okay. Got it. All right. \nPeter Jackson: Just mathematically, it gets smaller.\nKurt Yinger: Right, right. Okay. And then just my second one. It sounds like you're pretty confident in the year one synergies. Could you just talk a little bit more about some of the other focus areas in terms of operational excellence and any examples of wins as far as shared best practices since the business has come together over the last couple of months?\nDave Flitman: Yeah. I think this is a great area of what I mentioned earlier around cultural alignment, because if you recall both legacy companies had a strong focus on operational excellence and we just carried that through. We've merged the teams together and I've already started to focus on that in addition to the synergies. And some of the early things are just how do we most effectively get our products to the customers given the footprint that has come together? And we have seen a lot of benefit in taking miles out of the system in terms of how we've executed that shifted some customer demand from one location to another. And we're seeing that benefit in the bottom lines. So things like that where and how much inventory that we keep these are some of the early wins that the teams are already executing on.\nKurt Yinger: Got it. Appreciate the color. And good luck here in Q2 guys.\nDave Flitman: Really appreciate it.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. \nStanley Elliott: Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you all for squeezing me in.\nDave Flitman: Good morning.\nStanley Elliott: When you think about the MA business I mean, obviously you've got a very strong platform for it, are you seeing some of these smaller operators come to you looking as an exit strategy for them in lieu or ahead of potential tax changes or any changes or any issues they may have from a capacity standpoint given the credit line increases I imagine for a lot of the lumber and et cetera?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. I mean every day, right? I mean, M&A being the big dog means everybody calls us. So we absolutely are everybody's exit strategy which we love.\nDave Flitman: The phones have been ringing. I can say that. Yes, yes, yes.\nPeter Jackson: And what is important though in that dynamic, right, is you have to keep in mind as a buyer the reality of what is a sustainable business, what is a mid-cycle business, right. You can't pay the same multiples on a peak business, but there are tremendous opportunities out there to buy at reasonable multiples really tremendous assets. So it's good times.\nStanley Elliott: Yep. No exciting for sure. And then in terms of the footprint expansion and the focus on the manufacturing side are you at all having any problems finding real estate? Are supply chains constrained in terms of getting the machinery in? Anything like that that will keep you from executing on that part of your strategy right now? \nDave Flitman: I would say less on the real estate side certainly on the equipment side. The lead times on equipment have expanded over the last 18 months or so, but our teams were ahead of that and taking that into account and we're already ordering things that we don't expect to put in the ground for quite some time. So we've got a pretty strong forward look on that. Again the teams have come together well, we've got experts around things like press manufacturing. They know what they need and how to get ahead of it. \nStanley Elliott: Perfect guys. Thank you very much. Congratulations best of luck. \nDave Flitman: Thanks Stan.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question. This comes from Collin Verron with Jefferies. \nCollin Verron: Great quarter. Thank you for taking my question. It looks like your guidance implies a full year EBITDA margin in line with your 1Q almost 11%. Just given once you typically to seasonally lowest EBITDA margin quarter, can you just talk about the cadence of your expected margin performance for the rest of the year and then just how you're thinking about EBITDA margin over the long term? \nPeter Jackson: Yes. So I'm mean, I won't break out the quarters, but yes there's certainly an expectation that our even margins are going to be higher this year. Our flow-through has been great. Our demand obviously has been very high. There is certainly a seasonal nature to what we do. So inevitably you'll see some nice quarters during the summer when we reach our peak utilization and peak leverage. The nature of our long term, I think we've consistently talked about believing we could get the 9%, 10% EBITDA. We're certainly working on that internally every day in regards to what Dave was talking about on operational excellence the efficiencies that we think we can bring into this business this industry through technology through operational improvements through process. So certainly committed to that and believe that in the long run. The dynamics around any given quarter obviously are a little bit unique but for this year it is going to be an exceptionally strong year given the combination of high demand and record prices and certain products. \nCollin Verron: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you. \nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG. \nPeter Jackson: Good morning.\nRyan Gilbert: Good morning. First question more on manufactured products. I'm wondering if you're seeing any builders or an increased percentage of builders either going deeper into manufactured products offsite manufacturing or exploring opportunities to do so more than just buying a roof truss or a wall package? Like maybe what Raney has been doing in Florida? \nPeter Jackson: Well certainly Raney has done exceptionally well in a market like this. They're a great provider and I think very valued by their home building customers. I think Dave alluded to it before, it's really been consistent. It's not as if we ever had a lull in the demand for increased utilization. There are absolutely markets around the country and I think we've alluded to this before or talked about this before where historically you would not have expected to see a lot of demand for that offsite fabrication type of work. A state like Texas is a good example. Historically very low labor rates precluded the need for the labor overdrive that comes from the offsite fabrication. Those days are gone. There is absolutely strong demand in Texas. It's strong demand across the country. It's just kind of hard to tell the difference. Carrying 500 pounds or carrying 550 pounds I'm not sure I could tell you what the difference feels like. It's a lot. \nRyan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. You're adding capacity on the manufacturer product side. Are you seeing your suppliers either in lumber or in millwork doors and windows also add capacity, or has it been pretty consistent? \nPeter Jackson: We are. \nDave Flitman: Yes. Yes we've heard Peter mentioned earlier about the tightness in OSB. We've hear there were a couple of mills up in Canada that are coming back online the same in the US particularly in the south on the lumber side. So we're expecting that hopefully will help from a capacity standpoint. And obviously the window and door manufacturers are making similar investments here to try to capture as much of this demand as possible. \nRyan Gilbert: Okay. Thanks very much.\nDave Flitman: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Michael Neese for closing remarks. \nMichael Neese: Thank you for your time today and for your interest in Builder's FirstSource. We're around all day to take your questions. Take care and stay safe. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's call. We thank you for your attendance and participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. The positive momentum in our business continued with our record first quarter results. I very much appreciate the efforts of our more than 26,000 team members who are working tirelessly to provide best-in-class service for our customers in these unprecedented market conditions. They continue to grow our business while meeting the needs of our customers in a highly constrained supply environment. We are working closely with our customers and suppliers to reduce cycle-times amid material availability constraints and capitalize on our nation's very strong demand for single-family residential housing. And in that context, the power of our platform is evident as we are seeing rapid growth across all product lines and I could not be more pleased with our team's results. I'll cover five important topics on today's call; first, the positive macro and residential housing environment; second, our record first quarter results and what drove our out-performance; third, our excitement about how we think about our core business and a brief word on commodities; fourth, an update on our latest acquisition and the strength of our M&A pipeline; and finally, an update on the integration of BMC, which is running ahead of our plan. I'd like to take just a minute and share why I remain bullish on our industry and our company. First, let's look at residential housing. According to Freddie Mac the US housing market is 3.8 million single-family homes short of what is needed to meet the country's demand, representing a 52% increase in the nation's home shortage compared with 2018. The gap has widened significantly over the past two years as builders have struggled to keep up with demand in part due to labor and material supply constraints. These challenges play to our strengths including our structural component and value-added offerings. In recent years we have seen accelerating success in these areas and we believe there remains a tremendous opportunity for demand and demographically fueled growth ahead of us. In terms of demand, according to the US Census Bureau, total housing starts jumped 19.4% in March to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.74 million. The National Association of Home Builders reported that this is the fastest pace for combined single-family and multifamily construction in 15 years. There were only about one million existing homes for sale at the end of February, a nearly 30% drop compared with February 2020. That is the largest annual decline ever and the lowest supply on record. This should bode well for a strong construction pace of new housing starts as we move into the summer season. Improving housing starts, historically low mortgage rates, and a shift towards single-family living are all positive trends that remain tailwinds for our products and services. We now operate in 47 of the top 50 and 86 of the top 100 MSAs. Many of which are not only among the largest, but also some of the fastest-growing MSAs in the country. Our ability to manufacture and assemble structural components at our offsite facilities provides an integrated one-stop solution that helps solve the most challenging needs for our customers; labor availability and job site productivity. As a result of this area of strength and innovation, we expect to continue to outpace market growth for many years to come. Now, let's turn to our record first quarter results. We delivered another very strong top and bottom-line quarter and importantly our organic growth again outpaced the market as we continue to gain market share. On slide three of our investor deck, on a combined basis for BFS and BMC, total sales grew 54% to $4.2 billion. Our core organic sales growth increased 22%. Gross profit increased more than 50% and adjusted EBITDA increased an impressive 187% to $455 million. These record results reflect the favorable housing market, our industry-leading position, our ability to deliver value, and a continuation of our disciplined approach to cost management. We firmly believe our core organic sales growth is sustainable for the long-term and we are positioned for outperformance through economic cycles. We have received questions from analysts and investors over the past quarter about commodities wondering what our underlying growth would look like in recent years if we normalized the commodity side of our business. Holding commodities flat at $400 per 1,000 board feet, our estimates show we have outpaced market growth by 20% from 2018 through 2020 resulting in a roughly 8% revenue CAGR. And that momentum continues to accelerate in the first quarter of this year. Yet another way we have consistently demonstrated our ability to far outperform the market and take advantage of our differentiated product platform.  Now, as a combined entity, we have the geographical presence and even stronger platform to further advance our strategy. Turning to M&A, we announced today that we closed on our most recent acquisition earlier this month, John's Lumber, a premier building materials supplier serving the largest housing market in Michigan. The acquisition provides enhanced scale that will benefit our existing 14 locations in the State. The company generated approximately $49 million in net sales for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st 2021. We're excited to welcome the John's Lumber team members to the BFS family. With our very strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation, we will continue to reinvest in our business while actively pursuing M&A opportunities. As you can see on slide 5, we have identified over 500 targets and we will continue to be a consolidator in this industry for a long time to come. Finally, I'd like to update you on the BMC integration. Our efforts are ahead of schedule and we remain highly confident in achieving three-year cost synergies of $130 million to $150 million. For 2021, we expect to meet or exceed $60 million to $70 million in realized savings. We saw merger-related cost savings begin to accumulate in the first quarter and are accelerating in the second quarter. We continue to drive our internal operating system, which will allow us to accelerate productivity, improve processes and continue to grow our margins, while servicing our customers more competitively. We believe we can continue to help offset cost escalation with our offsite manufacturing processes and other value-added products including trusses, millwork, wall panels and ready-frame. We are also seeing positive momentum in our growth efforts, as our teams work together to leverage our scale and product strengths. The early returns are reflected in our exceptional first quarter results. These are exciting times and we are continuing to build our world-class home building distribution platform that positions us as a partner of choice. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I would like to highlight one of our many value team members. May is military appreciation month. Throughout the month, Builders FirstSource is celebrating our many veterans and profiling several of their success stories. One such story focuses on Jason Bennett, the General Manager of our De Pere, Wisconsin lumber location. He joined BFS five years ago, after serving for 23 years in the US army. As a First Sergeant, Jason was responsible for 200 soldiers. He ensured their safety, welfare and training while on active duty roles. And he learned key management skills that would last long after his military career. When it was time to retire from the military, Jason looked for a company that shared the values instilled in him by the army. And he found that in Builders FirstSource. Jason joined BFS as a delivery manager in Colorado Springs and immediately fit right in. He worked his way up to operations manager and then general manager. He led his team in adopting new logistics technologies, specifically our delivery and dispatch management system and was able to increase delivery efficiency by 20%. Jason is now a general manager in Wisconsin where he focuses on the safety of his team members and customers. His location continued as accident-free street and recently hit four years without a single recordable incident. We are proud to be a place where veterans feel valued and where their skills and experience translate into a rewarding civilian career. We're grateful for veterans like Jason and how they've served our country and are pleased to have them as part of the BFS family. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q1 results and our 2021 updated financial guidance. Thanks, Peter. With underlying demand the strongest it's been in nearly 15 years coupled with the broad-based product supply constraints and our country's continued recovery from a horrific pandemic, these truly are unprecedented times. I couldn't be more pleased or proud of how our team has responded. We delivered core organic sales growth over 20%, while also successfully managing through one of the largest mergers this industry has ever seen. We have the right strategy, we have the best team on the field and we're executing at a very high level. Our future is bright, and I'm highly confident in our ability to continue to outpace industry growth while operating in a $120 billion addressable market. Thanks for joining us today. And with that Brad let's open the call for questions. Good morning, Keith. Thanks for the question. Yes, as you point out, we've had a lot of success in our manufacturing products and I think it goes back to the success that each company was having individually. It was part of our strategies. It was something that we focused on historically. And what we've seen over the last few years is increased penetration and adoption by the home builders, because it's solving those problems we've talked about. It helps them build the homes faster. It helps them manage the job site more effectively and just be overall more productive. And we're excited about it. As you pointed out, our organic growth and components was about double what our core organic growth was this quarter which was outstanding. We expect that will continue. We continue to see rapid adoption in these component categories. No one is better positioned than we are in terms of being able to supply the needs of our customers in this area across the country. And so, we're excited about it. Yes. Great question, Matt. Thanks for asking that one. So as you pointed out, it's been a part of our strategy in both legacy companies. And as I said on the last call and I'll say again here, this integration between VFS and BMC could not be going better. Our teams have come together extremely well. You heard our comments on the synergies. We're ramping those up. We're having great success. The teams have meshed together extremely well. And obviously, based on our first quarter results, we've stayed focused on our customers and meeting their needs, which is exactly what we needed to do. Importantly, the fourth pillar of our strategy is M&A, and we have an extremely strong balance sheet. As we've talked about, we have a relatively small overall share in a very large market. It's an important part of our strategy. We've got the wherewithal and the focus to continue to drive acquisitions and as you pointed out in my comments this morning, we're focused on it. Sure. I think, what you've seen is steady adoption of these component categories over the past several years in both legacy companies. Obviously, we've got a very strong team on it. As Peter has mentioned, we've added capacity in several locations across the country. You'll continue to see us invest not only in component manufacturing, but automation of those facilities to make sure that we're meeting the demands of the marketplace and we're providing as high quality and consistent product as possible. To your question, I think the adoption continues to accelerate. Some of it is probably related to what's going on with commodities near term, but more importantly, and I think more broadly, what we're seeing is the customers that have experienced the benefits of our component offerings are adopting those more rapidly across their geographic footprint. And that's probably the greater tailwind in what we're seeing here over the near term. I do believe it's sustainable. I believe we'll continue to convert the market this way and we'll continue to invest in this category of the business. Thanks a lot. Yeah, Peter's right on and just add an exclamation point to that. We talk about our number one priority for uses of capital would be reinvesting in our company. The first portion of that goes to maintaining our facilities and making sure our people have what they need to get our products to the customers. The second order of priority is this area our value-added capabilities and continuing to invest heavily in that area of the business. You're right Mike. We have a very strong position right now. Our cash flow is tremendous. We've talked in the past about wanting to maintain a fortress a bulletproof balance sheet. I think we have every reason to be confident in that right now based on what we've done and we'll continue to stay vigilant. Dave mentioned our priorities around capital allocation with regard to internal investment and expansion internally and organically but also the inorganic opportunities are certainly out there. I think it's a fair question, right. We are going to generate a tremendous amount of cash and I'm very specific when I say going to because as you see in our results now we've borrowed money this quarter so we're not sitting on cash. This is not a burning platform. We are absolutely looking at if we continue to work with our board, come up with strategies that we want to put to work in terms of putting all of our capital to work in an efficient way. We've talked in the past about being committed to retaining some level of leverage in order to maximize shareholder return. We will stay committed to that. We just don't have any new announcements today. Thank you. Hi Dave. I think what you've seen overtime is both, legacy companies had a strong emphasis on pricing, models and getting more efficient at, how we take price to the marketplace. And then, secondly, that margin profile as Peter pointed out will continue to improve, based on our penetration of value-added products which we see no end to. Yeah. Good question. I think it's twofold. I think the whole build-cycle, as we've seen completions get extended out here, because has just been extended. So it's just changed the point at which our millwork is brought into the home. And then secondly, we've talked a lot about this Reuben, the supply constraints have been hit pretty hard in the windows and door piece of the business. And we're getting what we need, but it certainly has had an impact on our growth for the near-term. We expect that it will correct here through the course of the year. Thanks. Yeah, good question. I don't think we went into this intending to be conservative that $130 to $150 million range is solid. And we're executing very well. And as you heard me say, the teams have come together extremely well. And what I think is benefiting us or two things one is, the cultural alignment of these two legacy companies very, very similar. And then secondly, and perhaps to your question a little more importantly, is the experience that our teams have had in executing large mergers in the past. Our teams knew what to expect. We had very strong leadership that's been through this before. And we just got on with business. And so I think that's reflective of the early ramp-up that we've seen here, over the first quarter of work. We're excited about it. We can deliver more. We certainly will. But I would say, at this point, we're ahead of our plan and feeling good about the momentum. Yes. I think, to a large extent you're seeing two or three things happening right now. First of all, I think you're seeing the power and the strength of the platform that we've put together here with our unmatched geographic presence and the strength of our team. Secondly, I think, you're seeing the power of the strong relationships that we've built through both legacy companies with our suppliers. And they're doing their very best job to meet the needs that we have. And then third, I think, we have seen a shift in the marketplace where the builders, just given the significance and the broad breadth of the supply constraints, have been a little bit more brand agnostic, I think, to what they're putting into their homes, just driven in large part by the need. And then, given the access that we have to the broad base of suppliers and products, we've been able to meet those needs probably better than most. And we'd expect that to continue. 36% or 37%. No question about it. They're full steam ahead. Thank you, Jay. Hey, Kurt. Yeah. I think this is a great area of what I mentioned earlier around cultural alignment, because if you recall both legacy companies had a strong focus on operational excellence and we just carried that through. We've merged the teams together and I've already started to focus on that in addition to the synergies. And some of the early things are just how do we most effectively get our products to the customers given the footprint that has come together? And we have seen a lot of benefit in taking miles out of the system in terms of how we've executed that shifted some customer demand from one location to another. And we're seeing that benefit in the bottom lines. So things like that where and how much inventory that we keep these are some of the early wins that the teams are already executing on. Really appreciate it. Good morning. The phones have been ringing. I can say that. Yes, yes, yes. I would say less on the real estate side certainly on the equipment side. The lead times on equipment have expanded over the last 18 months or so, but our teams were ahead of that and taking that into account and we're already ordering things that we don't expect to put in the ground for quite some time. So we've got a pretty strong forward look on that. Again the teams have come together well, we've got experts around things like press manufacturing. They know what they need and how to get ahead of it. Thanks Stan. Yes. Yes we've heard Peter mentioned earlier about the tightness in OSB. We've hear there were a couple of mills up in Canada that are coming back online the same in the US particularly in the south on the lumber side. So we're expecting that hopefully will help from a capacity standpoint. And obviously the window and door manufacturers are making similar investments here to try to capture as much of this demand as possible. Sure. Thank you."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I too would like to thank all of our team members for delivering fantastic results in this unprecedented environment. Your focus and execution is frankly, incredible. I'll cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our combined first quarter results compared to the pro forma results from the prior year quarter. Then, I'll discuss our free cash flow and strong balance sheet. And finally, I'll provide updated guidance on the markets and our forecasted results for full year 2021. Net sales of $4.2 billion for the quarter increased 54.1% compared to the combined pro forma prior year period. Value added core organic sales increased by 22% led by 41.5% growth in our manufactured products category and 7% growth in our windows doors and millwork category. Commodity price inflation increased net sales by 31.3% and acquisitions contributed 2.4% to net sales growth. In Q1, we experienced stronger than expected demand in single-family starts across the country. And we are well positioned to support that demand. Our strong relationships with suppliers enable us to bridge product availability constraints and our value-added products and services provide relief from labor shortages. Our Q1 gross profit of $1.1 billion was an increase of 52.1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 25.6% was slightly better than expected but decreased 40 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a one-time purchase accounting adjustment. In light of the dramatic increase in costs this year, especially in commodities, I am pleased with our performance driven by the disciplined execution of our procurement and sales teams. SG&A increased 35.3% in the quarter, driven primarily by higher variable compensation related to the increase in profitability as well as depreciation and amortization and one-time charges, primarily related to the BMC merger. Excluding these variables, underlying SG&A decreased by 2.6%. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 270 basis points to 19.7% and it cost leverage on higher sales and continued strong expense controls, which more than offset higher variable costs. Adjusted EBITDA increased 187% to $455.2 million, driven by strong demand in single-family new constructions, commodity price inflation and cost leverage. Our adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 10.9%, which was up 500 basis points compared to 5.9% in the same combined pro forma period a year ago. Leverage on sales along with cost management and early synergies drove margin expansion. Core organic value-added product sales were especially impactful due to its rapid growth and higher average margins. We are in the early innings of our cost synergies and pricing opportunities. And we are accelerating our synergy capture and leveraging our combined capabilities. Let's turn to our first quarter cash flow, which was an outflow of $237 million due to our normal seasonal timing of working capital. In the quarter, we used $200.5 million in operating activities, primarily related to investments of over $500 million in networking capital. At the end of the first quarter, our pro forma net debt ratio was approximately 1.2 times our LTM adjusted EBITDA. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2027. And our total liquidity was approximately $1.1 million providing us with significant financial flexibility. Our strong first quarter results are a testament to our category-leading team and product portfolio, meeting the demands of the strong market momentum. While the impact of increased commodity costs is evident in our results, what is most important to us is that we continue to generate exceptional and sustained growth in our core business with a strong margin profile. The focus of our business is in higher margin, specialty and value-added products and services. Our portfolio of efficient problem solving products such as trusses and millwork continues to grow faster than the overall market. These specialty and value-added products and services have improved our margins over the years, as we help our customers solve labor availability, speed of construction and quality challenges on the job site. And as we have continued to consolidate the industry, we have created a consistent trend of improving operations and driving above market growth, while delivering accelerating EBITDA fall through. We have clearly created a competitively differentiated platform that can drive above-market growth, accelerate that growth with M&A and deliver fantastic bottom line results in any market environment. Let's turn to our 2021 full year outlook. We continue to see strong underlying demand in both new housing construction and remodeling. As we anticipated, builders are seeing such strong demand, that they are limiting sales in certain communities to keep from increasing backlogs due to material and labor availability constraints. Consistent with our first quarter results, our strong organic sales continued in April. Based on our Q1 performance, our positive conversations with customers, our realized synergies with the BMC acquisition and a better view of our pricing and cost environment, we are increasing our full year 2021 outlook. We expect full year net sales to grow to a range of $16 billion to $17 billion or approximately 25% to 33% over our 2020 pro forma net sales of 12.8 billion. This is driven by an increase in single-family starts as well as record commodity prices. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion or approximately 64% to 73% over our 2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $1.07 billion. Of the $500 million increase in adjusted EBITDA guidance from last quarter, roughly half is driven by poor organic growth and share gains, while the other half is driven by higher commodity prices. As a result of that outperformance, we are increasing the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance by $550 million to $1.4 billion. Our outlook is based on several assumptions which are outlined in the earnings release including low double-digit growth in single-family starts across our geographies. High single-digit to low double-digit decline in multi-family starts and low to mid-single-digit growth in R&R. Our commodity assumption provides a five to 15% lift to our top line growth. Commodity costs remain high with recent futures trading over $1600 per thousand. While levels remain elevated so far this year, we anticipate commodity prices to normalize by the fourth quarter. For some added context if commodity prices were to stay elevated at current levels through year-end we would expect to exceed our current guidance. Turning to capital allocation, we are committed to reinvesting in the business for maintenance and growth. We are focused on increasing our capacity through our list of internal CapEx projects and we have a solid pipeline of M&A candidates. As Dave mentioned, we have already executed one bolt-on acquisition this month and we are looking at several more. We continue to assess capital allocation options in light of our accelerating cash flow. Our local field teams are focused on delivering strong core organic growth and we continue to proactively manage expenses across our distribution footprint. We will meet or exceed our cost synergy goals of $60 million to $70 million this year and also deliver on our operational excellence initiatives. Overall, we are continuing to build a world-class distribution network to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders. We have never been more excited about our strategy and our future. Let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Yes, so we've added shifts, we've added facilities and we'll continue to go down that path absolutely. Yes, I think we're feeling pretty good about being able to hold stable. Maybe even see a little bit of tailwind, depending on the trajectory. It's a dynamic market as you know. Price increases not just in commodities, but across the board have been very impactful, but in terms of our discipline and our structure around passing through those prices, we've done a good job. I'm very proud of the team and I think we can continue to perform at this level. I think it's something we're very proud of. Thanks, Keith. Sure. Yes, for context, we've got well over a hundred facilities. We've opened between the combined entities around 13 over the last few years. We've continued to invest. In terms of the capacity utilization, a recent analytic on a single ship baseline would say, we were at about 75% capacity. And Mike, we've talked about this before, that's a tough description because that's not an average. So you've got some facilities that are below and some above that number, but we certainly have a really nice trajectory right now in terms of being able to leverage those new facilities, get them more fully ramped up, but also be able to do things like add second shifts which as you know, it doesn't quite double, but nearly doubles the capacity of any given facility. Also adding lines, also adding automation equipment to increase the productivity and capacity of any one of those lines, that's been the primary way that we've responded. More recently, our Riverside facility in California has come up and running. We've been able to add capacity, other facilities at a number of other facilities double-digit facilities around the country through new equipment. So certainly, it's an area that we've gotten pretty good at extracting more volumes, but at the end of the day, our forward look is absolutely adding footprint. New locations around the country, the adoption in certain markets in particular is very encouraging and we see that as a long runway of strength. Admittedly, the adoption is good, but the incremental share of how much of the home is built off site is continuing to grow and we think the trend continues to come our way with those labor costs going up, which inevitably happens in a market like this. But every time a cost goes up, those efficiency savings that we provide with manufactured products are magnified. We can save 10 board feet of waste on a particular truss. It's more meaningful at 1,600 than it is at 400. Hi Dave. Yeah, that's a great question. We are keeping our ear to the ground on that, because obviously we're making sure that our optimism at this point isn't misplaced. The short answer is no, the demand is tremendously strong. One of the things we said in the last call that I think was met with a little bit of skepticism is this idea that there's going to be a limit on how many homes builders can build even though there's virtually unlimited demand for those same homes. The level of announcements I don't remember, which analyst had put it out there, but 54% of home builders have announced constraining sales in some number of communities around the country. They're recognizing an inability to deliver homes at that high level. That again is really a sign of that strong demand and is far less about suppression of that demand by the level of prices as we see today. Some of these prices will normalize on their own and that's definitely a theme of ours in terms of commodities that we do expect it to normalize over time. But in the meantime, it is certainly a matter of responding to that, continuing strong demand, keeping up with those shortages around the country and staying disciplined in our management of both the flow-through to maintain our position as a premier supplier but also to maintain our management over prices and make sure we're fairly compensated for the work we're doing but strength across the board. Yeah, I think that's pretty consistent over the years. It's regional. We haven't seen widespread inability to get people the usual pockets of demand drivers, certain members of the truss manufacturing world challenging in certain areas. Now there's things you can do. Certainly we're doing well. Our profit sharing and bonuses are motivational to folks. We like our driver pay models in a lot of markets and we're continuing to enhance that certainly looking at shift differential. So there are things you can do to react in a measured way that allows you to evolve and respond depending on how the market is doing. If things pull-back, we could pull-back. But we haven't had any massive issues to date pockets here and there. Yeah. So it's a great question. This is a dynamic time. This whole commodity pricing being at record levels certainly has thrown us a curveball. I would say that the mix of the business just because of the mathematical change has shifted towards commodities. It's probably roughly 50% at this point, based on the increased prices. On the long-term though, the way we see the dynamic is very similar to where we were 12 months ago. And that's that, value add continues to be an increasing part of the business over the last couple of years, at least it's been the biggest component of the business with value in specialty making up 60 plus percent of what we sold in an average year. We think that continues. We think the trend of the broader product portfolio as well as the emphasis and the dependence of the greater homebuilding market on this offsite approach, given its efficiencies, given its ability to be safer and cost less in total, we think that continues to grow. There kind of is no topside to that. We talk about BFS back, as we came out of the great recession before the Probuild merger was about 50% value add, certainly think that's an achievable goal in the long-run. But again, this is a long game we're playing. Yeah. That's how we think about it. That long-term average feels like the reference point that we need to continue to communicate against, recognizing that there's a displacement right now in prices, displacement in demand and supply, probably the primary issue being supply. But eventually, it'll likely go back to a more normalized long-term average that 400 range. It's really just a matter of, when. Are we right on that? We know we're not right. That's the nature of commodity forecasting. So we figured we'd give you a sustainable, consistent target to head towards, when you think about our numbers and you can adjust as you see fit in terms of your expectations of, lumber prices. Thank you. Thanks Reuben. Yeah -- no that's a great question. In looking at that, analysis historically, we did get kind of a better sense. And you've heard us Reuben talk about, how we've got 12% to 15% fall through is sort of our standard incremental around sales. What we've noticed in these numbers is that, the inclusion of the value add mix, the inclusion of the operational excellence has actually driven that a little better. So we're in that kind of high-teens range for the fall through related to our incrementals, when you include all of those components the growth of the business. And then specifically to point out right now, the nature of commodities and the way that the market is changed, the constraint, the velocity of everything that fall through is actually a little higher. That's probably right around 20% right now. So, pros and cons of that, certainly taking advantage of it right now, but something to think about in the long-run. Thank you, Reuben. Yes. From a cash outflow perspective, the investment for synergies is pretty modest. We had talked about it being in the similar 130 to 150 range for expenses that, I certainly don't think, we're going to outspend that forecast either. Yes, the investment is really just in the incremental value of the inventory that we're maintaining, the normal increase in the amount of inventory that we would maintain at our yards in order to carry the increased level of business just seasonally. And then, probably, most importantly, at the end of the day, the incremental accounts receivable that ends up on the books at these higher price levels across the board. Would we otherwise have had more, if not for the material availability constraints? I think, the answer is, unequivocally, yes. I don't know how much more. I haven't really run the math on that but certainly, there are areas around the country where it's quite difficult to get the level of inventory that we would normally have, specialty products like OSB, for example, just extremely difficult to make sure you have what you need. And while we feel like we get more than our fair share, we'd sure like more. Thank you. Hi, Noah. Thank you. From a forecast perspective, we've talked about the inability of the broader industry to meet the massive amounts of demand. Noah, I know you know this, but for the broader group, we've talked about the seasonal capacity availability, that the shoulder seasons, by nature, offer more opportunity for rapid percent growth. We always would have expected a far higher year-over-year percent growth in Q1, candidly Q2 because of the COVID lapping and Q4, just because summer months always are max capacity every year. So we fully expect the ability to grow on a year-over-year basis to be suppressed as we get through those summer months. But that's already accounted for in our numbers. It's nothing new, but I think it's just important to keep in mind that those off season, if you will, shoulder season type of quarters will naturally lend themselves to eye-popping percent increases. Yes. So, I actually feel pretty good about that forecast, regardless of whether or not prices for commodities come down or not, just because of the way the math works. If prices come down, I'd spin off cash and if prices stay up I make more EBITDA. So that's a good number for us. Appreciate it. Thank you. The value add percentage for the prior year? I'm not sure I -- Yes. So value-add a year ago, I want to say, was right around 40%, 41%. This year it drops to 30%. Is it in the presentation? 36%? 36%, 37%. So you lose a few bits. It grew fast, but that windows, doors and millwork pulls down the average. Where you saw the shrinking of the mix was really in the R&R. Like you'd expect, right? The R&R, the multi-family, some of those other areas that just don't keep pace right now with the single-family starts businesses or products. Yeah, those guys are full up. They're not pushing out sales because they need them. They're pushing out sales because they're full to the brim. Thanks, Jay. Good morning. Yeah. I don't think it's fundamentally changed how people think about purchasing. I think there's certainly a bigger emphasis on making sure that they're staying efficient, which I think lends itself to some of this offsite manufacturing product model that we sell. I think there's also a willingness to consider substitution species and material substitution. We've certainly heard a lot more about that. It's an availability game, right? You're trying to make sure as -- well as a home buyer trying to make sure you get a house. But as a home builder, you want to make sure you're able to stay on some sort of a schedule. So the expectations, the ordering ahead for us it's making sure that we have a significant percentage of our buys that's on a contractual basis. So we make sure we're getting our place in line if you will. Historically, and I know you know this Kurt is that we've maintained a goal to keep a steady flow. We are going to be in the market consistently over time at our scale and our size and our demand around the country. We don't just sit on the sidelines for any meaningful period of time. That is true now that will continue to be true. I think that maintains our relationships with the mills in a very positive way. And we will continue to make sure we're building up inventory. You've got to be in this game for the better or for worse. We've talked about it in the past in terms of the fixed-price contracts. Certainly, those contracts have shrunk in recent months and year as a percentage of our total sales, but it's still I think it's representative of the type of commitment we have to our customers that we've got the balance sheet, we've got the credit, we've got the relationships. We're your partner that you want to rely on to be able to get to what you need for you to be successful and we're committed to having inventory to do that. Yeah. But certainly less than it used to be, right. With a reduction in the amount of fixed-price contracts, you'll see less suppression on the way up and less expansion in the way down of the gross market percent. Just mathematically, it gets smaller. Yeah. I mean every day, right? I mean, M&A being the big dog means everybody calls us. So we absolutely are everybody's exit strategy which we love. And what is important though in that dynamic, right, is you have to keep in mind as a buyer the reality of what is a sustainable business, what is a mid-cycle business, right. You can't pay the same multiples on a peak business, but there are tremendous opportunities out there to buy at reasonable multiples really tremendous assets. So it's good times. Yes. So I'm mean, I won't break out the quarters, but yes there's certainly an expectation that our even margins are going to be higher this year. Our flow-through has been great. Our demand obviously has been very high. There is certainly a seasonal nature to what we do. So inevitably you'll see some nice quarters during the summer when we reach our peak utilization and peak leverage. The nature of our long term, I think we've consistently talked about believing we could get the 9%, 10% EBITDA. We're certainly working on that internally every day in regards to what Dave was talking about on operational excellence the efficiencies that we think we can bring into this business this industry through technology through operational improvements through process. So certainly committed to that and believe that in the long run. The dynamics around any given quarter obviously are a little bit unique but for this year it is going to be an exceptionally strong year given the combination of high demand and record prices and certain products. Thank you. Good morning. Well certainly Raney has done exceptionally well in a market like this. They're a great provider and I think very valued by their home building customers. I think Dave alluded to it before, it's really been consistent. It's not as if we ever had a lull in the demand for increased utilization. There are absolutely markets around the country and I think we've alluded to this before or talked about this before where historically you would not have expected to see a lot of demand for that offsite fabrication type of work. A state like Texas is a good example. Historically very low labor rates precluded the need for the labor overdrive that comes from the offsite fabrication. Those days are gone. There is absolutely strong demand in Texas. It's strong demand across the country. It's just kind of hard to tell the difference. Carrying 500 pounds or carrying 550 pounds I'm not sure I could tell you what the difference feels like. It's a lot. We are."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Fourth Quarter 2022 and Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Brittney and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our recently appointed CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our fourth quarter and full year results. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDavid Rush: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Before we get into the results, I'd like to thank the Board of Directors for the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Builders FirstSource and for trusting me to lead this great organization. I also want to thank all of the BFS field leaders and team members for their support which has been inspiring. I come from a background in finance having spent the first 18 years of my career in various financial roles from controller to CFO. Over my 23 years with BFS, I've been fortunate to have had a variety of operational roles including Regional Oversight, primary responsibility for both the ProBuild and BMC integrations and most recently leadership of our enterprise-wide initiatives as EVP of our Strategic Management Office. I believe my experience and industry knowledge will be a strong basis to build on our success of creating long-term value for shareholders. Now, let's turn to the business results. Macroeconomic factors will undoubtedly continue to create headlines this year. However, with our exceptional and seasoned team, strong balance sheet and industry leading platform, we are in a great position to win in any environment. We have a field leadership team with over 30 years average experience in the industry. They have been through similar macroeconomic environments to the one we are currently facing today, which gives me great confidence in our ability to manage business changes with quick and decisive action as required. We have maintained very low leverage providing us with maximum flexibility to deal with any scenario and we continue to leverage our footprint, our scale, and our product portfolio to outcompete in the market. Let's turn to our long-term strategic priorities on Slide 4 for a moment. As we navigate a changing landscape, we see no need to alter our long-term strategy, and we remain focused on expanding organically in value-added products and services, driving operational excellence, continuing to build our high performing culture, and growing through strategic tuck-in acquisitions. On Slide 5, you can see our continued emphasis on the strategic priorities was key to our record full year 2022 net sales of $22.7 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 billion. Top line growth, value-added product mix improvement and disciplined cost management resulted in our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing 390 basis points to 19.3%. The combination of increased profitability and share buybacks supported 81% growth in full year 2022 adjusted EPS. On Slide 6, you can see that we delivered a 6.6% increase in core organic sales, including nearly 21% growth in our higher margin value-added products. We're extremely pleased to deliver $123 million in productivity savings for the year, exceeding our $100 million target as we drive improvement across a variety of projects and leverage our BFS One Team Operating System. We remain focused on the importance of controlling SG&A and other expenses. This includes efficiency, efficient cap capacity utilization, ongoing optimization of our footprint, and balancing the need for variable cost reductions and future capacity. Importantly, we have rationalized over 30 locations during the last year while main maintaining coverage and not exiting any markets. I'm extremely proud of how we continue to demonstrate our high performing culture through improved safety by lowering our recordable incident rate by approximately 22% year-over-year, which marks the second consecutive year of improvement. We also continue to invest in training enhanced DEI initiatives and improved employee benefits to better attract and retain high performing talent. Turning to M&A on Slide 7, in addition to our focus on profitable core organic growth, we continue to execute tuck-in acquisitions aligned with our strategy completing six acquisitions in 2022. Although the M&A pipeline has slowed in the current macro environment, we continue to be acquisitive while remaining disciplined in our approach. We are committed to expanding our geographic footprint in key markets with a particular emphasis on enhancing our value-added portfolio to better serve our customers, diversify our end market exposure, and leverage our technological capabilities. This is evidence by our recent acquisitions including Pima Door & Supply in the fourth quarter, which expands our millwork footprint in the Phoenix area and earlier this month, we acquired Noltex Truss, a five location truss manufacturer providing building components to the single and multi-family markets throughout Texas. This tuck-in acquisition further extends our leading position in value-added products across the state. We are excited to welcome both Pima and Noltex with their longstanding customer relationships and track record of profitable growth to the BFS family. The still highly fragmented nature of our industry supports our ambition to invest $500 million in M&A per year on average for the next several years. Moving to Slide 8 and looking at our capital allocation in aggregate for 2022, we deployed approximately $3.5 billion of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases and remain on track to achieve the goal we established at our 2021 Investor Day of deploying $7 billion to $10 billion from 2022 to 2025. We will continue to closely monitor our customer sentiment, which currently suggests a challenging year ahead. During the fourth quarter, we saw a slowdown in average daily sales, which has continued into the first quarter. Higher mortgage rates and affordability challenge continue to be headwinds. On Slide 9, we outlined the benefits of our flexible business model for dynamic operating environments such as the one we're currently experiencing. As we have discussed, we are actively managing the business as conditions indicate, and we are acting decisively wherever we see decelerating demand. Our focus is on effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to match costs with volumes. We are optimizing capacity and reducing discretionary spend without impairing our ability to maximize the recovery when this turns the corner. Stepping back, we realize affordability has been an increasing concern over the past several years as home prices and rates have increased significantly. We are working and making housing more attainable by investing in the value-added products, productivity and digital capabilities to reduce cycle times and make homebuilding more efficient. For example, in 2022, we invested approximately $125 million in CapEx supporting our value-added product growth and digital strategy. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize our investments in our fleet, value-added technology, and digital automations. Together, these initiatives will help lower total costs, improve affordability, and allow more people to buy homes. We are committed to strategically accelerate our leading market position and deliver on our overall value proposition, and we will continue to execute while keeping our focus on providing the best possible service to our customers. Now, let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss our pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry. We have a long-term commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies that we believe will drive greater efficiency across homebuilding and enhance our product offerings. On the homebuilders software side, we are executing our development plan and integrating that with our BFS operations through our digital sales teams.\nmyBLDR.com:\nmyBLDR.com: Last month at our national event, we announced our inaugural BFS Hall of Fame Class for 2022, the culmination of our annual employee recognition program and a highlight of our people first culture. These distinguished individuals represent the best of our frontline team members, but there is one person I would like to highlight today, Frank Gloria. Frank is a Fleet and Compliance Manager out in Southern California who has been with the company and its predecessors for an impressive 45 years. He oversees our fleet and machinery across 11 locations. Frank takes great pride in keeping everything running consistently and with minimal downtime. His manager emphasized quote, Frank's knowledge of everything mechanical is simply unrivaled. On behalf of the leadership team, I want to thank Frank and the other hall of fame inductees for their tremendous contributions. I will conclude by saying that we have the best team to win in a challenging environment. I am confident in our strategies and our ability to deliver long-term results for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you Dave and good morning everyone. I want to congratulate Dave on his appointment as our new CEO. I've worked with him for many years and couldn't be happier for him and for this company. I know he will lead us to continued growth and success. I also want to join Dave in thanking our team members for delivering a record year of performance. We sincerely appreciate your hard work and dedication to delivering excellent service to our customers day in and day out. I'm proud to report that we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter to cap off a record year of the business. We continued to manage through the complex operating environment with a proactive mindset and a disciplined approach. We expect that the structural enhancements we have made in our business over the past decade will help us mitigate the impact of softer housing demand and inflationary headwinds. Our ample liquidity, low leverage and disciplined cost management provides significant financial firepower to continue to strategically and opportunistically grow our business. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our fourth quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment, and finally, I'll discuss our first quarter guidance and lay out illustrative full year scenarios. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slide 12. We delivered $4.4 billion in net sales. Core organic growth decreased by 8% attributable to a nearly 14% decline in single-family as slowing demand compared to strong fourth quarter 2021 led to difficult comps. Both multi-family and repair, remodel, and other increased by almost 15%. Multi-family was driven by a strong rental market and resulting backlog. R&R and Other growth was mainly attributable to increased sales focus and capacity versus prior year. Two fewer selling days had an unfavorable impact of roughly 3% on net sales. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 8 percentage points of growth to net sales. Value-added products saw another quarter of growth compared to total fourth quarters starts, which decreased by 16%. Core organic sales in the category increased by 0.6%, reflecting the macro trend of value-added product adoption and our success in the category. I'm very happy to highlight value-added products represented over half of our revenue in the quarter, a great proof point of success towards our goal of being the supplier of choice for these valuable high growth products. During the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion or roughly comparable to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 200 basis points to 34.1%, mainly due to the increased mix of value-added products. SG&A grew 11% to $958.7 million, mainly due to additional operating expenses from companies acquired in the last year inflation and other costs. Acquisitions represented over 60% of the increase in SG&A. As a percentage of net sales total SG&A increased by 340 basis points to 22%. We remain focused on disciplined cost management and are taking appropriate actions in response to volume dynamics on a market by market basis. These actions include footprint rationalization, discretionary spending reductions, and cutting headcount and overtime. As we have stated in the past, approximately 70% of SG&A expense is variable. Within that 70% roughly 20% of sales is driven by volume based formulas, things like commissions and bonuses. The remaining 50% of sales is where we are actively managing our operations. We are striking the right balance between resizing operations based on changes in volume and protecting capacity for future growth. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $700 million, a decline of $97 million, primarily due to declines in core organic sales and commodities partially offset by M&A. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA margin was 16%. This represents the second fast fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in our history reflecting our focused execution and expense control. Adjusted net income was $470.8 million, down from an adjusted net income of $532.4 million in the prior year quarter, attributable to a decrease in net sales and higher SG&A expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.21 compared to $2.78 in the prior year period. The increase reflects our more than $650 million in accretive share repurchases investments during the quarter. To put this in perspective, the repurchase equates to $0.21 or nearly half of the $0.43 change. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 14. Our fourth quarter operating cash flow was approximately $971 million, mainly attributable to increased profitability due to effective pricing and cost management, as well as disciplined working capital management. Generally, we see working capital as incremental or decremental of approximately 10% of sales. Capital expenditures were $131 million. All-in we delivered robust free cash flow of approximately $840 million. For the year we generated record free cash flow of approximately $3.3 billion, representing a free cash flow yield of 30.6% operating cash flow. Return on invested capital was 41.1% for the year ended December 31. Our 2022 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.7 times and approximately 1.3 times our estimated 2022 base business EBITDA, well within our stated target of 1 to 2 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.5 billion consisting of $1.4 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $100 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the fourth quarter, we repurchase approximately 10.2 million shares for $651 million at an average stock price of $64.17 per share. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 900,000 shares so far in the first quarter of 2023 for $61 million at an average stock price of $65.94. During 2022 we repurchase almost 42 million shares for $2.6 billion [ph], and we have more than $900 million remaining in our authorization. In total, we have repurchased more than one third of our outstanding shares in the last 18 months. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and we'll continue to look for inorganic growth opportunities and to repurchase shares at an attractive value. We maintain a fortress balance sheet, which will help us withstand a slower housing environment and keep us well positioned for long-term growth. Turning to Slide 15, we continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology. During 2022, base business revenue grew 13% while base business adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-over-year. This approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized commodity margins and static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. Overall, I'm proud that we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter despite slowing housing starts. Additionally, our record results for the full year reflect our differentiated platform, talented team members, and intense focus on execution. I'm confident that through our leading footprint, investments in value-added products, and ongoing efficiency initiatives, that we can continue to gain share, grow our value-added products, and deploy capital. Now, I would like to discuss our guidance on Slide 16. Given the current challenging conditions in the housing market, amid elevated mortgage rates and general uncertainty in economic conditions, we are amending our guidance disclosures at this time to align with our public customers. Customers of all types and sizes have expressed their uncertainty about starts in the year ahead. As a result, we have decided to only provide guidance for the first quarter of 2023 as shown on Slide 16. We will reassess full year guidance for actual end base business as the year progresses. For the first quarter, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $400 million to $440 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 11.7% to 11.9%. I would also note that the first quarter guide assumes gross margins to be in the 30% to 32% range. In addition, given the 2022 starts profile, we expect comparisons to prior year will be most difficult in the first two quarters. Our guidance includes the following full year assumptions, which are also outlined in the earnings release, and on Slide 17. We expect total capital expenditures in the range of $300 to $350 million. This includes continued investments in value-added products, and we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure, and we will migrate to one integrated ERP platform in the coming years. I'll remind you that the related increases in CapEx and OpEx are included in our guidance and our 2025 financial projections from our December 2021 Investor Day. We expect interest expense in the range of $150 million to $170 million, an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%. Depreciation and amortization expenses in the range of 525 million to $550 million, no change in the number of selling days, and we expect to deliver between $90 million and $110 million in productivity savings. We recognize that it's important to think about potential outcomes for the full year, so on Slide 18, we provide a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing markets and commodity conditions. I will reiterate that we are not providing full year guidance here, but this scenario analysis should help clarify our range of performance expectations and demonstrate the capability of our business to achieve strong adjusted EBITDA margins in 2023. To summarize, we are exceptionally well positioned to withstand a slowdown in housing while continuing to drive our strategic goals forward. We have a strong balance sheet and no long-term debt maturities until 2030. We are operating in a proactive fashion and are taking the necessary steps to manage through this downturn with a relentless focus on execution. I'm confident our best-in-class operating platform will continue to generate solid free cash flow, which provides further financial flexibility. We will also diligently deploy capital and work to maximize long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDavid Rush: Thanks Peter. Let me provide a few final thoughts. Having spent the greater part of my career with BFS, I firmly believe in our differentiated platform, which is the strongest it's ever been and will enable us to outperform in any environment. We have a clear strategy that we're continuing to execute. We generated strong cash flow, and we have significant opportunities to invest that cash to expand our value-added products and solutions, execute strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. Through it all we remain focused on operational excellence to continue to drive increased safety, productivity, and profitability. 2023 will be a challenging year for our industry, but I'm confident in our talented team members who have clearly demonstrated their ability to execute and win in any market. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's open the call now for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nTrey Grooms: Hey, good morning everyone. Dave, congrats on your new role. Look forward to working with you.\nDavid Rush: Hi Trey. Thanks, Trey.\nTrey Grooms: Sure. So I guess first, multi-family and R&R very strong in the quarter. Can you talk about how these two segments, the multi-family and R&R are trending through 1Q and, and how you're thinking about these business lines kind of as we progress through 23?\nDavid Rush: Thanks, Trey. That's a great question. I'll start with R&R. R&R if you expand it in the current year primarily because we had capacity constraints in 2021 and 2022 just taking care of our existing business. Once those capacity constraints waned, our ability to focus on that segment again allowed us to go after new customers and try to generate more R&Rs business. But multi-family, it's been primarily through acquisition.\nTrussway:\nPanel Truss:\nTrey Grooms: Perfect. Thanks for that. And I guess my next question you'd laid out Peter, you laid out expectations for over $1 billion in free cash flow if memory serves me right, and I think it that was in kind of this 800,000 single-family start environment. First off, is that still the expectation? And then how does free cash flow or how do you expect free cash flow to, to move relative to that sensitivity table you gave us in the deck?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, no, thanks, Trey. So that's a good question. There's a lot going on in the market and so we've stayed away from the cash flow including it in the full year scenarios, but yes, the short answer to your question is we still think it's north of $1 billion in free cash flow, assuming about a 20% starts down scenario and a reasonably steady commodity environment. As you know, those, both of those things can move our working capital quite a bit. Generally speaking, we still believe that that roughly 10% incremental or decremental working capital with sales is a good way to think about us. So given the dynamics around what commodities are doing, kind of what starts are doing, as well as the core underlying business' ability to generate cash, we do think that north of $1 billion number is still right.\nTrey Grooms: Got it. Okay, perfect. That's good and encouraging. If I could sneak one last one in, you know, the value-added piece now over half your sales in the quarter, that's super impressive. As the single-family business likely slows further in the coming quarters, how would you expect the value-added mix to change? Would there be or would you expect there to be more or less appetite from homebuilders to utilize these products?\nDavid Rush: Yes Trey, I appreciate that question. It makes sense for you to ask it. The value-added has shown incredible resiliency even as we've had headwinds and starts and the market has turned a little bit, at least especially on the component side. They're just such a nice offset to the labor challenge and the labor challenge is going to be consistent even in the current housing environment we're in. So we haven't seen people move away from components even as their starts have gone down. We have achieved over a 50% of our sales in total value-added in Q4, which has been a nice buoy to our overall sales mix, and we think through growing through our recent acquisitions that we're going to be able to continue to maintain that pace.\nTrey Grooms: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPeter Jackson: Yes and probably the only thing I'd throw in, the only thing I'd throw in there, Trey, is that it does correlate to some degree the starts, right? I mean, yes, they're still using it and they're not going away from it like Dave was saying, but we don't want to somehow argue that Truss is going to maintain its volumes when starts are down there. There is a correlation there, but we are seeing growth, we're seeing secular growth, and so that's certainly a strong area for us, and I think you heard it in my comments, right? So fourth quarter value-add, we were still favorable even though starts were down more than 16%.\nTrey Grooms: Yep. Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for taking the question. I'll pass it on. Good luck.\nDavid Rush: Thanks Trey.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatthew Bouley: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions and welcome Dave to the earnings call. So first question on, you know, still kind of seeing that gross margin above 30% for the Q1 guide. When we look at the midpoint of your scenarios of that kind of 10% to 11% EBITDA margin for the year, what does that imply about the gross margin beyond Q1? How quickly does it normalize and any color on sort of commodity versus non-commodity gross margins as well would be helpful? Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. The storyline for that gross margin number continues to be one of good progress. We're pleased with what we've seen so far, but certainly an open question in terms of where it gets to. So as you highlighted, things have stayed strong in the gross margin line. It is beginning to retrace what we've discussed in the past, right, beginning to normalize as the supply chain normalizes. We certainly have performed well. I mean our 30% to 32% gross margin guide for Q1 is certainly well north of what we've said historically is our normalized roughly 27% plus gross margin. We're continuing to see really nice performance and mix up from the value-add component of our business, which we hope for and which we're expecting. But as the year progresses, we do anticipate that continuing to trend back towards a normalized level. You know, we're pretty optimistic about what that looks like, but for now I'm not ready to provide any real guidance in terms of the full year.\nDavid Rush: Yes, the only other thing I'd add Matt is, part of how we've managed margin is actually through some of our cost improvement initiatives around manufacturing. We've actually improved our board foot per man hour by 22% since the merger. That productivity in Truss allows us and will allow us to compete effectively for share even in a challenging environment. So we're kind of going at it from all angles and trying to maintain the margin the best we can.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay, that's very helpful. That makes sense. Second one, on the value-add you had the 16% decline in manufactured products over the quarter. Clearly that's more tied to the front end of construction. And I think you had the windows, doors and millwork growing 22% reflecting completions. My question is, how should we think about the timing of those converging? Kind of at what point do you see this sort of tale of completions beginning to more closely resemble what we've seen in starts? Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Yes, Matt, that's a good question. I think we've pretty much already seen that convergence as we get farther into the quarter. Our door and millwork sales have somewhat normalized, but we still believe in the value-added segment as a positive for the overall business. And the Truss component, as I said, has been really resilient. We haven't seen people move away from Truss, granted, because there's fewer starts. We're going to have fewer sales in Truss, but the fact that we can maintain that percentage of our overall business is very encouraging to us and we believe it will continue.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. All right, thanks Dave. Thanks Peter. Good luck guys.\nDavid Rush: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Good, thank you. We'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nKetan Mamtora: Thank you. First question, recognizing that there's still a lot of uncertainty around, can you give us some sense of how you guys are thinking about the multi-family business and R&R? It seems like that is becoming a greater focus area for y'all.\nDavid Rush: Yes Ketan. I appreciate the question. Multi-family will certainly be a buoy for us in 2023. We are not quite sure how 2024 is going to play out. I was at the Harvard Housing Conference and there was some concern that multi-family in 2024 may start seeing some headwinds. What we're seeing in the amount of bid activity for 2024 has not tremendously waned though. So we're still slightly optimistic there. On the R&R front, again, the thing that made that difficult for us in prior years was capacity and the supply chain constraints that we were facing. It was hard to fully explore that opportunity and go after new business when we were having struggles with supply chain taking care of existing customers. So we will rededicate our focus on growing that share now that those kind of conditions have lessened.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question, either Dave or Peter, it seems like there is some investor concern about your sort of ability to hold onto price gains on the manufactured component side, with engineered wood pricing also starting to fall quite sharply, obviously single-family is down. Can you talk at a high level, sort of at least philosophically, how you'll approach that?\nDavid Rush: Yes, that's a great question. I think for us we did invest significantly almost $100 million and our ability to gain productivity through automation in all our plants; that has created a cost advantage for us in the marketplace. We believe we're the low cost provider for Truss in the marketplace. That gives you a little bit of flexibility to go after share where that's the answer, and to be able to hold on to a little bit of margin for a little longer time where that's available. Anything you want to add there, Peter?\nPeter Jackson: Yes and I think we've talked a lot about the amount of investment we've made in pricing management and pricing rigor and pricing discipline. That's certainly an important part about how we expect to manage this business on a go forward basis and combine with this point about how efficient we are, we think that puts us in a great position to offer a total cost benefit to our customer, while at the same time getting a fair margin and being able to hold on to what we worked so hard for. So we're certainly optimistic right now, especially as you see each quarter's numbers come through.\nDavid Rush: I do believe normal margins for product that the margin ran up simply based on supply and the demand dynamics, that will normalize first and we're already seeing that. You've definitely seeing it, for example, with lumber and sheet goods as an example. The other products in our industry won't respond as quickly and as deeply as lumber and sheet goods have, but we should see some of that. But as far as what we can control, I think what we're going to try to do is, is win by providing better customer service, better reduced cycle times for our customers, allow them to win on cycle time costs, and then we'll be able to hold on to some of the margin that we've tried to create.\nKetan Mamtora: That's helpful perspective. Good luck in 2023. I'll jump back in the queue.\nDavid Rush: Thanks, Ketan.\nOperator: And thank you. We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Barclays. Your line is, I apologize, with Baird. Your line is now open.\nDavid Manthey: Yes, thank you. And let me add my congratulations to you, Dave.\nDavid Rush: Thanks.\nDavid Manthey: First question, could you discuss your comfort level with the debt in a downside 2023 scenario? I assume you delever a lot from the balance sheet unwinding, but is there any change in your views at all on M&A or share repurchase as we move through this downturn yet or potentially in the future?\nDavid Rush: Yes, thanks Dave. That's a great question. So the short answer is, we feel really good about the balance sheet and we think that our priorities around capital allocation are still the right ones. We're going to lean in on it. You know, we've got no really, no structured debt till 2030. The ABL is, we just reran that one from a timeline perspective. So we've got new maturity start, plenty of liquidity. We feel very good about the strength of the balance sheet. You layer on the fact that, as you noted, we would expect to release some working capital in the event of a further sort of slowing in the market. So that will be a nice tailwind in terms of available cash. The business is still generating cash, so feel good about that, even in some of these more aggressive downside scenarios. And then the overlay of all that is, we do expect there to be opportunities, right? While M&A has certainly been a source of growth for us, and it has slowed down in terms of total number of opportunities on the market, we still see nice targets at reasonable multiples as evidenced by the Noltex deal that we think should be part of the BFS family. And we're going to continue to execute those. So we're going to -- as we stay disciplined, we think there's really going to be, there are going to be nice opportunities for us to continue to do that. And as we've demonstrated up through now, we think there's real intrinsic value in the repurchase of shares. So to the extent we're not seeing good targets in M&A or we don't have the capacity internally to do more M&A, we'll continue to leverage that as well.\nPeter Jackson: The only, the only thing I'd add on the M&A front is we are still at or above our plan that we laid out on Investor Day of $500 million per year dedicated to M&A. So even as it slows now over the long-term, we don't have any concern over hitting that target.\nDavid Manthey:\nREADY-FRAME:\nDavid Rush:\nREADY-FRAME:\nREADY-FRAME:\nDavid Manthey: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Rush: Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist. Your line is open.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. On the guidance for the first quarter, can you give us any kind of breakout how much the revenue decline is from commodity deflation versus units, and the kind of value-added comment within that would be nice as well?\nDavid Rush: Well, and then in terms of the breakdown, the commodity prices have pretty well, I would say leveled out based on what we're looking at been pretty stable. So the decline year-over-year in commodities is meaningful. It will get worse on a comp basis as we go through the second quarter. Last year it peaked in Q2, so certainly a lot of headwind from commodities. And you know, what we've seen is sort of that trend down on a year-over-year comp basis that trend down started probably Q3, Q4 last year, probably the best way to describe it. So comps will be most difficult in Q1 and Q2 and get a little easier in the back half of the year. We won't break down the guide in those sub components, but hopefully that gives you good context.\nKeith Hughes: Yes, that's directly what I was looking for. And I guess the question on cash flow, you've played out some M&A targets with the stock where it is now, would you consider buying in excess of free cash flow on other borrowing as we go through this downturn on shares or are you going to be limiting yourself on share repurchase with cash you're generating?\nDavid Rush: Well, I mean, I think the way we think about deploying capital broadly, right, is that we have an appropriate balance sheet. We're well structured. As long as we're in kind of our range of one to two times base business, we're extremely comfortable. Certainly not intimidated by the idea of being a little below or a little above for a window of time. I think that's just good management. But we certainly are committed to continuing to deploy capital. We think it's a responsibility of management. We think it's a responsible thing to do. We think it's good for shareholders, so we're going to continue to stay committed. And we'll look for opportunistic moments, right? Where in each one of those categories, we think there'll be times when it might make sense to lean in. But we're never going to put ourselves in a position where we put ourselves at risk. We've got a lot of confidence in our ability to sort of see what the business is capable of and manage that liquidity and we're confident we can work well in that range.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Rush: Thanks Keith.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Your line is now open.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, good morning everyone. Just a question on the mix of business. Is there any meaningful impact on margins, either positive or negative from a higher mix of multi-family and R&R revenue?\nDavid Rush: Yes, Adam, that's a good question. In 2023 multi-family will be a tailwind for our margin. It only creates a little bit of a tailwind though, because it's still only about 15% of our overall business. R&R traditionally has been a higher margin product as well and we expect a favorable result from R&R on our margin maintenance. It will help us hold on to margin. Again, the combination of those two products is a smaller percentage of our overall business and generally our margin profile follows single-family, but they will be helpful in us maintaining as we normalize in other areas.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay, got it. And then just on digital solutions, you guys said you are on track to deliver $1 billion in revenue by 2026, can you maybe give us an update on where you ended in 2022?\nDavid Rush: Yes, Adam I'd love to talk about our digital milestone. So 2022 is a year of development. We really weren't trying to monetize the concept in 2022, and actually even through 2023 it would only be a marginal revenue opportunity. We're playing end game here with the digital solution. What we're focused on in 2023 is the full development of the platform and we believe by the end of the year, we will have achieved all the development milestones. We're piloting it in 40 with 40 customers across four markets. We're going to learn a lot from that. We're going to go back, we're going to refigure, we're going to redevelop, we're going to change what we need to. Because at the end of the day, the full recognition of value in this solution is through pull through sales by making us easier to do business with. We believe fully in that concept still. We believe we are light years ahead of any of our competition as it relates to where we stand in the development process. And we still believe in our goal of $1 billion of incremental sales by 2026, primarily through pull through business. Anything you want to add there, Peter?\nPeter Jackson: You nailed it. Perfect.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay, great. Thanks, best of luck.\nDavid Rush: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Group. Your line is open.\nSteven Ramsey: Hi, good morning. Maybe to start with, on CapEx, the last couple of years, it seems like there, the delay of delivery has caused some push out on CapEx spend, supply chain and labor is a little bit better now. Do you feel like you can deliver on all the CapEx this year are more likely to deliver than prior years? And is there any delay embedded in this current guidance?\nDavid Rush: Yeah, no thanks, Steven, you're right. We struggled to get what we've wanted. It's gotten a little better. There has not been nearly the relief in things like rolling stock that there have been in certain other categories. So that's still a source of, I would say strain. It's getting better. So my sense is this year's CapEx will be more achievable than last year. There's certainly a lot we want to do, and we're still optimistic that that will continue to free up as the year progresses.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay, helpful. And then another question somewhat related to CapEx and labor as you plan for a downturn, but also want to be prepared for taking advantage of longer-term strength in housing, how do you think about holding on to labor for the long-term and building out capacity even if it's not fully soaked up in the next 12 or so months?\nDavid Rush: Yes, so the capacity question is a good one. But we firmly believe in investing in the long-term. So we aren't changing our priorities as it relates to investments and capacity, specifically around value-added products. And in fact, we're trying to address kind of labor concerns a little bit through some of these investments. We have fully robotic lines in Georgia and Texas that we're still working through and trying to make sure and having some success with. And I think we have six to seven more on the books that we're going to add over the next two to three years. So we're seeing investments in technology and investments in automations as a way to really address both labor concerns we have today and in the future. So that will definitely not stop. As it relates to the core business, we've been really diligent about protecting our A and B players out in the marketplace and that's not going to change either because we see that as and what we're experiencing now is somewhat of a short-term scenario and over the long-term we want to come out of this guns and blazing on the other side with our best people. So that's kind of how we're approaching it right now.\nSteven Ramsey: Excellent. Thank you.\nDavid Rush: Thanks you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Your line is open in\nJay McCanless: Thanks. Good morning. Congrats Dave.\nDavid Rush: Thank you, Jay.\nJay McCanless: Yes, you bet. So Slide 18, kudos on this new EBITDA presentation, very useful. But when you talk to your single-family builder customers, where do you think they're falling right now on this, these three ranges, negative 15 to negative 25 seems to be what we hear from a lot of people. But would love to hear what feedback you've been getting from your single-family customers on where they think 2023 falls out.\nPeter Jackson: Yes, I'll start on that one and Dave can jump on. So the short answer is, they're all over the place. There's a lot of differential depending on what market you're in, the type of house you're selling, your exposure to customer versus SPAC. We talked a lot about east to west, how much harder this market has been, how rapid the downturn has been in certain markets. So it really is all across the board with people quite pessimistic and quite optimistic being, I would say equally common. So what we try to do is account for a few of those scenarios playing out, trying to think about what they balance out in our numbers to give you some sense of if we lean one way or lean the other, right? If Powell [ph] got leaning one way or leaning the other what might potentially play out. So it's, as you can imagine, that's been a tough one for us.\nDavid Rush: Yes, I mean it's the reason you have three different scenarios there to pick from, right? You saw it as recently as coming out of the year in December, most builders were really pessimistic. Mortgage rates dipped down a couple 20, 40 basis points and all of a sudden the light turned on and everybody started showing up again. So it was really hard to just try to narrow it down to one narrow range and that's why we gave you the different scenarios. But the good thing is, we do know underlying demand remains strong, evidenced by how quickly people returned to the marketplace once they realized mortgage rates were at a rate that they felt like they could execute on the home purchase that they were after. So it was just additional proof that over the long-term home, underlying home demand is there. We've just got to make sure that we balance that affordability against that demand.\nJay McCanless: Got it, thank you. And then my second question in terms of M&A activity slowing down a little bit, kind of surprised by that because we've been hearing that the banks have been tightening up on land lending and tightened up generally on anything related to housing or are you just, or the potential target you're looking at, are they not feeling that pinch right now or did everyone have such a good two or three years that they can hold off for a little bit? May be a little more depth on that?\nDavid Rush: I think it's more of what you just said, the latter part. I think they had a good couple year run. They're looking at fairly uncertain environment now and they're just not ready to get off the fence. I think as the year plays out and as we see more certainty as the year plays out around interest rates and mortgage rates and people can evaluate what the next 12 to 18 months look like, I think they'll jump back in and of course we're looking continuously throughout the time that we're there.\nJay McCanless: Okay, great, thanks. And then the last one I had, just, if you think about whatever metric you want to use, bid activity, quote, request, et cetera, you know, because we did see kind of a tale of two cities of mortgage rates in January and February. Can you talk about how business was in January of what it, what February looked like compared to January just given the spike higher that we did see in rates?\nDavid Rush: Yes, I mean, I think what you described is accurate. It has been a bit erratic ups and downs. I don't know that there's a trend there broadly other than to say it's slower than last year and it's certainly a market that's trying to find its own. Yes, I don't think breaking it down at this point is going to help anybody, but it's certainly a market we're staying very close to operationally to ensure we are responding correctly to whatever is dealt.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah, they only, the only thing I'd add is this is not a 2008, 2009 scenario, right? Demand over the long-term is still extremely positive and that demand is not speculative. It's for houses that they want to live in. So over the long haul we still feel pretty good, even though it's going to be a little choppy until we get our footing.\nJay McCanless: Sounds great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDavid Rush: Thank you.\nOperator: Well, we will take our next question from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.\nReuben Garner: Thanks. Good morning everybody, and congrats Dave on the new role.\nDavid Rush: Thanks.\nReuben Garner: So I had some technical difficulties, so I'm just going to ask one question, so I don't repeat anything and hopefully this one's not repetitive, but the reiteration of the $7 billion to $10 billion in deployable capital from the Investor Day, I think starts are probably likely off in the 30% range and I kind of looked at that deployable capital as kind of a free cash flow equivalent. And maybe that's wrong, but I just wanted to, I guess, clarify if that 7 to 10 is kind of the cash generation of the business. And if so, what kind of, what is the biggest thing that gives you confidence that you can still do that even though the star environment has clearly moved against you in such a big way?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, no, that's a good question. So 2021 guide for those of you who don't remember, was $7 to $10 billion of deployable capital. And the way that was, think about that is 7 was at a onetime leverage at the end and 10 was at a two times leverage at the end. So that's one to two times the, the base business EBITDA from a leverage perspective. The short answer is, we've talked about this a lot and I'm not sure everybody gets it, but commodities for us is an important part of our business, but we make money regardless. We make a lot more money when the price is very high. So it becomes a bit of an option where if you have a high future price, you get a lot more cash flow into the business. And that's exactly what we experience in year one of our execution against our Investor Day targets. We had an incremental amount of cash that has put us far ahead of the pace necessary to make our number, even though you're right currently the forecast of where 2023 is going to be for starts as well below what we have built into our forecast, we talk about low single growth is being, or low single digit single family starts growth is being embedded into the model. But we're certainly in a very strong position with the start that we've had to be able to deliver on that regardless. And as I mentioned, we still expect to see healthy free cash flow delivery throughout the remaining years on top of that nice strong head start.\nReuben Garner: Thanks Peter. Congrats on the strong results guys and good luck on board.\nDavid Rush: Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question with Collin Verron with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nCollin Verron: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to start at the, the fiscal year 2023 scenario of single family starts down 15% to 25%. The sales range there is $15 billion to $17 billion, which is only about a 10% decline in sales versus the 2022 base business sales of $17.7 billion you reported. Can you just talk about the factors there that would get you to that outperformance versus your largest end market?\nDavid Rush: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think that's a -- I'm glad you're asking the question that way. I think it's the right way to think about it. The variables obviously are starts. Starts in single-family being the biggest impact on us, the other being the impact of M&A right? We've been acquisitive and the year-over-year growth from those acquisitions are certainly impactful in terms of how we're performing versus the prior year numbers. There's a bit of growth margin in there. The normalization will be a bit of a headwind, but we are also seeing some share growth that we've embedded in that as well. So that's an offset. So, but you know, across the board being able to offset a share, a portion of that single-family decline through the strength of our core business and, and the differentiated model is a healthy thing for us and we're certainly quite proud of it.\nCollin Verron: Great. That's helpful color. And I guess my last question here is just on the productivity savings, you guys are expecting that $90 million to $110 million. Can you just give some examples of those productivity improvements that you're executing on here in 2023 and just how achievable those are in these different volume type environments?\nDavid Rush: It actually, it goes hand-in-hand with what we need to do from a standpoint of competitiveness related to slower housing starts and increasing our customer service reducing cycle times. So a lot of it is around synergies that we realized from new M&A we've done over the last 18 months. Some of it is related to payroll productivity, getting more for less specifically within our delivery initiatives and some of our truck turnaround initiatives. Some are around manufacturing productivity as I mentioned since the merger board foot per man hour has gone up 22%. That is a combination of best practices across plants as we continue to acquire value-added plants from other parts of the country and integrate them into the BFS way of doing things. There's productivity savings there. We're always constantly reviewing our indirect spend. There's opportunities there. So we, we, we've probably got six to eight different initiatives that will fund that $90 million to $110 million and we're very confident in our ability to get there.\nCollin Verron: Great, thank you for the color.\nDavid Rush: Yes.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Michael Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMichael Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, Dave. Congrats on the new role. Thanks Mike. A couple follow ups. On the on the first quarter guide, the slide has a comment saying, there's a bullet point saying that sales and adjusted EBITDA include the expected benefit of price, commodity and margin impacts for the quarter. You know, I think Peter, as you articulated earlier there is a sharper commodity headwind from a top line standpoint in one queue. So can you just elaborate maybe a little bit on what that comment means and if it's possible to then split out if there is still some benefit on margins, what your base business for 1Q would be estimated at versus that 400 to 440 total?\nDavid Rush: Yes, so I think probably the biggest challenge in this is, that there's no base business at a quarterly level that's, that's not a, it doesn't actually exist, so I'm not holding out on you in terms of talking about that number. You're right, there is a, there is a lot going on in the year-over-year comps and the ability to break out those pieces. Unfortunately it is generally driven by some detailed analytics. We have some top side assumptions, but I don't think they're particularly helpful to you in terms of insight. A lot of the year-over-year comparison from a commodities perspective is negative in the first half or far more negative in the first half than the second. Unfortunately just from a, the ability to break those pieces apart, so starts comp. So I think that our guide or our comment when we were given the guide saying that the first half is going be harder from a comparisons perspective unfortunately it's probably my best insight to offer for the, for the numbers this year.\nMichael Dahl: Yes, okay. Yes, I guess it was just, since that comment says there's still benefits in there, but maybe that speaks to the margin, margins haven't quite normalized yet in 1Q.\nDavid Rush: Yes, I've got\u2026\nPeter Jackson: We have a footnote that is really just trying to say it's all in, that was all.\nMichael Dahl: Yes, I got you. Okay. And, and so my second question is, is kind of somewhat related, but just a two-parter on the full year scenarios. And so as a point of clarification, when you say commodity price my sense has been that a blend of lumber in OSP [ph], but can you correct me if I'm wrong there and, and hit the starting point. Okay. So then just for a frame of reference if we're looking at a blended price year to date, you know, it, it seems like that's kind of in the mid three hundreds, maybe oscillating between mid-300 s and high 300 s. Is that a fair characterization of where you're at year-to-date on that blend?\nDavid Rush: Yes, I mean, if I just talk to Randall Langs, I think that's right between 350 and 400 is the range a little bit below our base business assumption in terms of how the year has started, but it's early.\nMichael Dahl: Yes, lot of changes on, on that on a week-to-week or day-to-day basis. Okay. And, and then, so when we think about the range of scenarios. Obviously you've spoken to the gross margin dynamics a bit and SG&A is going to flex up or down a decent amount depending on if you're like, down 10 versus down a 30, right? But when you think about putting this range together in terms of how you get down to the ultimate EBITDA number, which part is the bigger swing factor in in your models? Is the gross margin line pretty steady normalizing down and the swing factor in EBITDA margin is mostly SG&A flexing or is there a different mix as you get kind of progressively lower on the scale of these scenarios?\nPeter Jackson: That's a really good question. You know, we're in the mid-20s, or sorry, low 20s for SG&A as a percent of sales and it's about 70% variable. You're talking about 6% that's in that fixed bucket. You probably think about the impact of margins, obviously that falls like price all the way through the bottom line, so that's very impactful. I guess off the top of my head they seem pretty comparable. I actually don't have a hard answer for you on that, but I think you're right. Those are two of the major components. What happens when sales decline and how much the leverage can we offset with, you know, rescaling the business. And then how does pricing fall through you know, the more aggressive any potential downturn might end up being. We do expect it to be harder on both margins and commodity prices.\nMichael Dahl: Got it, okay. Thanks Peter.\nPeter Jackson: Sure, thanks Mike. Good. We will take our last question from Alex Rygiel - B. Riley. Your line is now open.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you. You referenced a slowdown in the average daily sales sort of in December and January. Can you quantify that?\nPeter Jackson: Well, I mean there's two pieces to it. One of them is the normal seasonality. We do see generally speaking about 20% less sales in the depth of winter than we do in the peak of summer. It's a lot more than that obviously in the seasonal markets, but we're also seeing the down trend of sort of orders generating starts, generating sales from us on new houses. So that decline has been pretty consistent as one might expect, we would expect to lap the peak probably Q2.\nAlex Rygiel: And then excluding commodity products are you seeing suppliers reduce their prices yet?\nPeter Jackson: More rumors than actions, but there are a couple of categories where they're, it looks like it's probably going to happen and will stick. For the most part though, it's been less increases or no increases.\nDavid Rush: Yes, they're still struggling as well with labor and what they're having to pay for costs of labor. But at the end of the day, the normal dynamics around supply and demand are going to run out and people are going to go after share, they're going to do it with whatever availability they have. It just hasn\u2019t been widespread at this point.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you very much.\nDavid Rush: All right, thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you Dave and good morning everyone. I want to congratulate Dave on his appointment as our new CEO. I've worked with him for many years and couldn't be happier for him and for this company. I know he will lead us to continued growth and success. I also want to join Dave in thanking our team members for delivering a record year of performance. We sincerely appreciate your hard work and dedication to delivering excellent service to our customers day in and day out. I'm proud to report that we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter to cap off a record year of the business. We continued to manage through the complex operating environment with a proactive mindset and a disciplined approach. We expect that the structural enhancements we have made in our business over the past decade will help us mitigate the impact of softer housing demand and inflationary headwinds. Our ample liquidity, low leverage and disciplined cost management provides significant financial firepower to continue to strategically and opportunistically grow our business. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our fourth quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment, and finally, I'll discuss our first quarter guidance and lay out illustrative full year scenarios. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slide 12. We delivered $4.4 billion in net sales. Core organic growth decreased by 8% attributable to a nearly 14% decline in single-family as slowing demand compared to strong fourth quarter 2021 led to difficult comps. Both multi-family and repair, remodel, and other increased by almost 15%. Multi-family was driven by a strong rental market and resulting backlog. R&R and Other growth was mainly attributable to increased sales focus and capacity versus prior year. Two fewer selling days had an unfavorable impact of roughly 3% on net sales. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 8 percentage points of growth to net sales. Value-added products saw another quarter of growth compared to total fourth quarters starts, which decreased by 16%. Core organic sales in the category increased by 0.6%, reflecting the macro trend of value-added product adoption and our success in the category. I'm very happy to highlight value-added products represented over half of our revenue in the quarter, a great proof point of success towards our goal of being the supplier of choice for these valuable high growth products. During the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion or roughly comparable to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 200 basis points to 34.1%, mainly due to the increased mix of value-added products. SG&A grew 11% to $958.7 million, mainly due to additional operating expenses from companies acquired in the last year inflation and other costs. Acquisitions represented over 60% of the increase in SG&A. As a percentage of net sales total SG&A increased by 340 basis points to 22%. We remain focused on disciplined cost management and are taking appropriate actions in response to volume dynamics on a market by market basis. These actions include footprint rationalization, discretionary spending reductions, and cutting headcount and overtime. As we have stated in the past, approximately 70% of SG&A expense is variable. Within that 70% roughly 20% of sales is driven by volume based formulas, things like commissions and bonuses. The remaining 50% of sales is where we are actively managing our operations. We are striking the right balance between resizing operations based on changes in volume and protecting capacity for future growth. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $700 million, a decline of $97 million, primarily due to declines in core organic sales and commodities partially offset by M&A. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA margin was 16%. This represents the second fast fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in our history reflecting our focused execution and expense control. Adjusted net income was $470.8 million, down from an adjusted net income of $532.4 million in the prior year quarter, attributable to a decrease in net sales and higher SG&A expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.21 compared to $2.78 in the prior year period. The increase reflects our more than $650 million in accretive share repurchases investments during the quarter. To put this in perspective, the repurchase equates to $0.21 or nearly half of the $0.43 change. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 14. Our fourth quarter operating cash flow was approximately $971 million, mainly attributable to increased profitability due to effective pricing and cost management, as well as disciplined working capital management. Generally, we see working capital as incremental or decremental of approximately 10% of sales. Capital expenditures were $131 million. All-in we delivered robust free cash flow of approximately $840 million. For the year we generated record free cash flow of approximately $3.3 billion, representing a free cash flow yield of 30.6% operating cash flow. Return on invested capital was 41.1% for the year ended December 31. Our 2022 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.7 times and approximately 1.3 times our estimated 2022 base business EBITDA, well within our stated target of 1 to 2 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.5 billion consisting of $1.4 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $100 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the fourth quarter, we repurchase approximately 10.2 million shares for $651 million at an average stock price of $64.17 per share. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 900,000 shares so far in the first quarter of 2023 for $61 million at an average stock price of $65.94. During 2022 we repurchase almost 42 million shares for $2.6 billion [ph], and we have more than $900 million remaining in our authorization. In total, we have repurchased more than one third of our outstanding shares in the last 18 months. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and we'll continue to look for inorganic growth opportunities and to repurchase shares at an attractive value. We maintain a fortress balance sheet, which will help us withstand a slower housing environment and keep us well positioned for long-term growth. Turning to Slide 15, we continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology. During 2022, base business revenue grew 13% while base business adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-over-year. This approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized commodity margins and static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. Overall, I'm proud that we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter despite slowing housing starts. Additionally, our record results for the full year reflect our differentiated platform, talented team members, and intense focus on execution. I'm confident that through our leading footprint, investments in value-added products, and ongoing efficiency initiatives, that we can continue to gain share, grow our value-added products, and deploy capital. Now, I would like to discuss our guidance on Slide 16. Given the current challenging conditions in the housing market, amid elevated mortgage rates and general uncertainty in economic conditions, we are amending our guidance disclosures at this time to align with our public customers. Customers of all types and sizes have expressed their uncertainty about starts in the year ahead. As a result, we have decided to only provide guidance for the first quarter of 2023 as shown on Slide 16. We will reassess full year guidance for actual end base business as the year progresses. For the first quarter, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $400 million to $440 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 11.7% to 11.9%. I would also note that the first quarter guide assumes gross margins to be in the 30% to 32% range. In addition, given the 2022 starts profile, we expect comparisons to prior year will be most difficult in the first two quarters. Our guidance includes the following full year assumptions, which are also outlined in the earnings release, and on Slide 17. We expect total capital expenditures in the range of $300 to $350 million. This includes continued investments in value-added products, and we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure, and we will migrate to one integrated ERP platform in the coming years. I'll remind you that the related increases in CapEx and OpEx are included in our guidance and our 2025 financial projections from our December 2021 Investor Day. We expect interest expense in the range of $150 million to $170 million, an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%. Depreciation and amortization expenses in the range of 525 million to $550 million, no change in the number of selling days, and we expect to deliver between $90 million and $110 million in productivity savings. We recognize that it's important to think about potential outcomes for the full year, so on Slide 18, we provide a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing markets and commodity conditions. I will reiterate that we are not providing full year guidance here, but this scenario analysis should help clarify our range of performance expectations and demonstrate the capability of our business to achieve strong adjusted EBITDA margins in 2023. To summarize, we are exceptionally well positioned to withstand a slowdown in housing while continuing to drive our strategic goals forward. We have a strong balance sheet and no long-term debt maturities until 2030. We are operating in a proactive fashion and are taking the necessary steps to manage through this downturn with a relentless focus on execution. I'm confident our best-in-class operating platform will continue to generate solid free cash flow, which provides further financial flexibility. We will also diligently deploy capital and work to maximize long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks. Yes, no, thanks, Trey. So that's a good question. There's a lot going on in the market and so we've stayed away from the cash flow including it in the full year scenarios, but yes, the short answer to your question is we still think it's north of $1 billion in free cash flow, assuming about a 20% starts down scenario and a reasonably steady commodity environment. As you know, those, both of those things can move our working capital quite a bit. Generally speaking, we still believe that that roughly 10% incremental or decremental working capital with sales is a good way to think about us. So given the dynamics around what commodities are doing, kind of what starts are doing, as well as the core underlying business' ability to generate cash, we do think that north of $1 billion number is still right. Yes and probably the only thing I'd throw in, the only thing I'd throw in there, Trey, is that it does correlate to some degree the starts, right? I mean, yes, they're still using it and they're not going away from it like Dave was saying, but we don't want to somehow argue that Truss is going to maintain its volumes when starts are down there. There is a correlation there, but we are seeing growth, we're seeing secular growth, and so that's certainly a strong area for us, and I think you heard it in my comments, right? So fourth quarter value-add, we were still favorable even though starts were down more than 16%. Thanks, Matt. The storyline for that gross margin number continues to be one of good progress. We're pleased with what we've seen so far, but certainly an open question in terms of where it gets to. So as you highlighted, things have stayed strong in the gross margin line. It is beginning to retrace what we've discussed in the past, right, beginning to normalize as the supply chain normalizes. We certainly have performed well. I mean our 30% to 32% gross margin guide for Q1 is certainly well north of what we've said historically is our normalized roughly 27% plus gross margin. We're continuing to see really nice performance and mix up from the value-add component of our business, which we hope for and which we're expecting. But as the year progresses, we do anticipate that continuing to trend back towards a normalized level. You know, we're pretty optimistic about what that looks like, but for now I'm not ready to provide any real guidance in terms of the full year. Yes, Matt, that's a good question. I think we've pretty much already seen that convergence as we get farther into the quarter. Our door and millwork sales have somewhat normalized, but we still believe in the value-added segment as a positive for the overall business. And the Truss component, as I said, has been really resilient. We haven't seen people move away from Truss, granted, because there's fewer starts. We're going to have fewer sales in Truss, but the fact that we can maintain that percentage of our overall business is very encouraging to us and we believe it will continue. Yes and I think we've talked a lot about the amount of investment we've made in pricing management and pricing rigor and pricing discipline. That's certainly an important part about how we expect to manage this business on a go forward basis and combine with this point about how efficient we are, we think that puts us in a great position to offer a total cost benefit to our customer, while at the same time getting a fair margin and being able to hold on to what we worked so hard for. So we're certainly optimistic right now, especially as you see each quarter's numbers come through. The only, the only thing I'd add on the M&A front is we are still at or above our plan that we laid out on Investor Day of $500 million per year dedicated to M&A. So even as it slows now over the long-term, we don't have any concern over hitting that target. You nailed it. Perfect. Yes, I'll start on that one and Dave can jump on. So the short answer is, they're all over the place. There's a lot of differential depending on what market you're in, the type of house you're selling, your exposure to customer versus SPAC. We talked a lot about east to west, how much harder this market has been, how rapid the downturn has been in certain markets. So it really is all across the board with people quite pessimistic and quite optimistic being, I would say equally common. So what we try to do is account for a few of those scenarios playing out, trying to think about what they balance out in our numbers to give you some sense of if we lean one way or lean the other, right? If Powell [ph] got leaning one way or leaning the other what might potentially play out. So it's, as you can imagine, that's been a tough one for us. Yeah, they only, the only thing I'd add is this is not a 2008, 2009 scenario, right? Demand over the long-term is still extremely positive and that demand is not speculative. It's for houses that they want to live in. So over the long haul we still feel pretty good, even though it's going to be a little choppy until we get our footing. Yes, no, that's a good question. So 2021 guide for those of you who don't remember, was $7 to $10 billion of deployable capital. And the way that was, think about that is 7 was at a onetime leverage at the end and 10 was at a two times leverage at the end. So that's one to two times the, the base business EBITDA from a leverage perspective. The short answer is, we've talked about this a lot and I'm not sure everybody gets it, but commodities for us is an important part of our business, but we make money regardless. We make a lot more money when the price is very high. So it becomes a bit of an option where if you have a high future price, you get a lot more cash flow into the business. And that's exactly what we experience in year one of our execution against our Investor Day targets. We had an incremental amount of cash that has put us far ahead of the pace necessary to make our number, even though you're right currently the forecast of where 2023 is going to be for starts as well below what we have built into our forecast, we talk about low single growth is being, or low single digit single family starts growth is being embedded into the model. But we're certainly in a very strong position with the start that we've had to be able to deliver on that regardless. And as I mentioned, we still expect to see healthy free cash flow delivery throughout the remaining years on top of that nice strong head start. We have a footnote that is really just trying to say it's all in, that was all. That's a really good question. You know, we're in the mid-20s, or sorry, low 20s for SG&A as a percent of sales and it's about 70% variable. You're talking about 6% that's in that fixed bucket. You probably think about the impact of margins, obviously that falls like price all the way through the bottom line, so that's very impactful. I guess off the top of my head they seem pretty comparable. I actually don't have a hard answer for you on that, but I think you're right. Those are two of the major components. What happens when sales decline and how much the leverage can we offset with, you know, rescaling the business. And then how does pricing fall through you know, the more aggressive any potential downturn might end up being. We do expect it to be harder on both margins and commodity prices. Sure, thanks Mike. Good. We will take our last question from Alex Rygiel - B. Riley. Your line is now open. Well, I mean there's two pieces to it. One of them is the normal seasonality. We do see generally speaking about 20% less sales in the depth of winter than we do in the peak of summer. It's a lot more than that obviously in the seasonal markets, but we're also seeing the down trend of sort of orders generating starts, generating sales from us on new houses. So that decline has been pretty consistent as one might expect, we would expect to lap the peak probably Q2. More rumors than actions, but there are a couple of categories where they're, it looks like it's probably going to happen and will stick. For the most part though, it's been less increases or no increases."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Before we get into the results, I'd like to thank the Board of Directors for the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Builders FirstSource and for trusting me to lead this great organization. I also want to thank all of the BFS field leaders and team members for their support which has been inspiring. I come from a background in finance having spent the first 18 years of my career in various financial roles from controller to CFO. Over my 23 years with BFS, I've been fortunate to have had a variety of operational roles including Regional Oversight, primary responsibility for both the ProBuild and BMC integrations and most recently leadership of our enterprise-wide initiatives as EVP of our Strategic Management Office. I believe my experience and industry knowledge will be a strong basis to build on our success of creating long-term value for shareholders. Now, let's turn to the business results. Macroeconomic factors will undoubtedly continue to create headlines this year. However, with our exceptional and seasoned team, strong balance sheet and industry leading platform, we are in a great position to win in any environment. We have a field leadership team with over 30 years average experience in the industry. They have been through similar macroeconomic environments to the one we are currently facing today, which gives me great confidence in our ability to manage business changes with quick and decisive action as required. We have maintained very low leverage providing us with maximum flexibility to deal with any scenario and we continue to leverage our footprint, our scale, and our product portfolio to outcompete in the market. Let's turn to our long-term strategic priorities on Slide 4 for a moment. As we navigate a changing landscape, we see no need to alter our long-term strategy, and we remain focused on expanding organically in value-added products and services, driving operational excellence, continuing to build our high performing culture, and growing through strategic tuck-in acquisitions. On Slide 5, you can see our continued emphasis on the strategic priorities was key to our record full year 2022 net sales of $22.7 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 billion. Top line growth, value-added product mix improvement and disciplined cost management resulted in our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing 390 basis points to 19.3%. The combination of increased profitability and share buybacks supported 81% growth in full year 2022 adjusted EPS. On Slide 6, you can see that we delivered a 6.6% increase in core organic sales, including nearly 21% growth in our higher margin value-added products. We're extremely pleased to deliver $123 million in productivity savings for the year, exceeding our $100 million target as we drive improvement across a variety of projects and leverage our BFS One Team Operating System. We remain focused on the importance of controlling SG&A and other expenses. This includes efficiency, efficient cap capacity utilization, ongoing optimization of our footprint, and balancing the need for variable cost reductions and future capacity. Importantly, we have rationalized over 30 locations during the last year while main maintaining coverage and not exiting any markets. I'm extremely proud of how we continue to demonstrate our high performing culture through improved safety by lowering our recordable incident rate by approximately 22% year-over-year, which marks the second consecutive year of improvement. We also continue to invest in training enhanced DEI initiatives and improved employee benefits to better attract and retain high performing talent. Turning to M&A on Slide 7, in addition to our focus on profitable core organic growth, we continue to execute tuck-in acquisitions aligned with our strategy completing six acquisitions in 2022. Although the M&A pipeline has slowed in the current macro environment, we continue to be acquisitive while remaining disciplined in our approach. We are committed to expanding our geographic footprint in key markets with a particular emphasis on enhancing our value-added portfolio to better serve our customers, diversify our end market exposure, and leverage our technological capabilities. This is evidence by our recent acquisitions including Pima Door & Supply in the fourth quarter, which expands our millwork footprint in the Phoenix area and earlier this month, we acquired Noltex Truss, a five location truss manufacturer providing building components to the single and multi-family markets throughout Texas. This tuck-in acquisition further extends our leading position in value-added products across the state. We are excited to welcome both Pima and Noltex with their longstanding customer relationships and track record of profitable growth to the BFS family. The still highly fragmented nature of our industry supports our ambition to invest $500 million in M&A per year on average for the next several years. Moving to Slide 8 and looking at our capital allocation in aggregate for 2022, we deployed approximately $3.5 billion of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases and remain on track to achieve the goal we established at our 2021 Investor Day of deploying $7 billion to $10 billion from 2022 to 2025. We will continue to closely monitor our customer sentiment, which currently suggests a challenging year ahead. During the fourth quarter, we saw a slowdown in average daily sales, which has continued into the first quarter. Higher mortgage rates and affordability challenge continue to be headwinds. On Slide 9, we outlined the benefits of our flexible business model for dynamic operating environments such as the one we're currently experiencing. As we have discussed, we are actively managing the business as conditions indicate, and we are acting decisively wherever we see decelerating demand. Our focus is on effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to match costs with volumes. We are optimizing capacity and reducing discretionary spend without impairing our ability to maximize the recovery when this turns the corner. Stepping back, we realize affordability has been an increasing concern over the past several years as home prices and rates have increased significantly. We are working and making housing more attainable by investing in the value-added products, productivity and digital capabilities to reduce cycle times and make homebuilding more efficient. For example, in 2022, we invested approximately $125 million in CapEx supporting our value-added product growth and digital strategy. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize our investments in our fleet, value-added technology, and digital automations. Together, these initiatives will help lower total costs, improve affordability, and allow more people to buy homes. We are committed to strategically accelerate our leading market position and deliver on our overall value proposition, and we will continue to execute while keeping our focus on providing the best possible service to our customers. Now, let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss our pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry. We have a long-term commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies that we believe will drive greater efficiency across homebuilding and enhance our product offerings. On the homebuilders software side, we are executing our development plan and integrating that with our BFS operations through our digital sales teams. Thanks Peter. Let me provide a few final thoughts. Having spent the greater part of my career with BFS, I firmly believe in our differentiated platform, which is the strongest it's ever been and will enable us to outperform in any environment. We have a clear strategy that we're continuing to execute. We generated strong cash flow, and we have significant opportunities to invest that cash to expand our value-added products and solutions, execute strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. Through it all we remain focused on operational excellence to continue to drive increased safety, productivity, and profitability. 2023 will be a challenging year for our industry, but I'm confident in our talented team members who have clearly demonstrated their ability to execute and win in any market. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's open the call now for questions. Hi Trey. Thanks, Trey. Thanks, Trey. That's a great question. I'll start with R&R. R&R if you expand it in the current year primarily because we had capacity constraints in 2021 and 2022 just taking care of our existing business. Once those capacity constraints waned, our ability to focus on that segment again allowed us to go after new customers and try to generate more R&Rs business. But multi-family, it's been primarily through acquisition. Yes Trey, I appreciate that question. It makes sense for you to ask it. The value-added has shown incredible resiliency even as we've had headwinds and starts and the market has turned a little bit, at least especially on the component side. They're just such a nice offset to the labor challenge and the labor challenge is going to be consistent even in the current housing environment we're in. So we haven't seen people move away from components even as their starts have gone down. We have achieved over a 50% of our sales in total value-added in Q4, which has been a nice buoy to our overall sales mix, and we think through growing through our recent acquisitions that we're going to be able to continue to maintain that pace. Thanks Trey. Yes, the only other thing I'd add Matt is, part of how we've managed margin is actually through some of our cost improvement initiatives around manufacturing. We've actually improved our board foot per man hour by 22% since the merger. That productivity in Truss allows us and will allow us to compete effectively for share even in a challenging environment. So we're kind of going at it from all angles and trying to maintain the margin the best we can. Thanks Matt. Yes Ketan. I appreciate the question. Multi-family will certainly be a buoy for us in 2023. We are not quite sure how 2024 is going to play out. I was at the Harvard Housing Conference and there was some concern that multi-family in 2024 may start seeing some headwinds. What we're seeing in the amount of bid activity for 2024 has not tremendously waned though. So we're still slightly optimistic there. On the R&R front, again, the thing that made that difficult for us in prior years was capacity and the supply chain constraints that we were facing. It was hard to fully explore that opportunity and go after new business when we were having struggles with supply chain taking care of existing customers. So we will rededicate our focus on growing that share now that those kind of conditions have lessened. Yes, that's a great question. I think for us we did invest significantly almost $100 million and our ability to gain productivity through automation in all our plants; that has created a cost advantage for us in the marketplace. We believe we're the low cost provider for Truss in the marketplace. That gives you a little bit of flexibility to go after share where that's the answer, and to be able to hold on to a little bit of margin for a little longer time where that's available. Anything you want to add there, Peter? I do believe normal margins for product that the margin ran up simply based on supply and the demand dynamics, that will normalize first and we're already seeing that. You've definitely seeing it, for example, with lumber and sheet goods as an example. The other products in our industry won't respond as quickly and as deeply as lumber and sheet goods have, but we should see some of that. But as far as what we can control, I think what we're going to try to do is, is win by providing better customer service, better reduced cycle times for our customers, allow them to win on cycle time costs, and then we'll be able to hold on to some of the margin that we've tried to create. Thanks, Ketan. Thanks. Yes, thanks Dave. That's a great question. So the short answer is, we feel really good about the balance sheet and we think that our priorities around capital allocation are still the right ones. We're going to lean in on it. You know, we've got no really, no structured debt till 2030. The ABL is, we just reran that one from a timeline perspective. So we've got new maturity start, plenty of liquidity. We feel very good about the strength of the balance sheet. You layer on the fact that, as you noted, we would expect to release some working capital in the event of a further sort of slowing in the market. So that will be a nice tailwind in terms of available cash. The business is still generating cash, so feel good about that, even in some of these more aggressive downside scenarios. And then the overlay of all that is, we do expect there to be opportunities, right? While M&A has certainly been a source of growth for us, and it has slowed down in terms of total number of opportunities on the market, we still see nice targets at reasonable multiples as evidenced by the Noltex deal that we think should be part of the BFS family. And we're going to continue to execute those. So we're going to -- as we stay disciplined, we think there's really going to be, there are going to be nice opportunities for us to continue to do that. And as we've demonstrated up through now, we think there's real intrinsic value in the repurchase of shares. So to the extent we're not seeing good targets in M&A or we don't have the capacity internally to do more M&A, we'll continue to leverage that as well. READY-FRAME: Thanks, Dave. Well, and then in terms of the breakdown, the commodity prices have pretty well, I would say leveled out based on what we're looking at been pretty stable. So the decline year-over-year in commodities is meaningful. It will get worse on a comp basis as we go through the second quarter. Last year it peaked in Q2, so certainly a lot of headwind from commodities. And you know, what we've seen is sort of that trend down on a year-over-year comp basis that trend down started probably Q3, Q4 last year, probably the best way to describe it. So comps will be most difficult in Q1 and Q2 and get a little easier in the back half of the year. We won't break down the guide in those sub components, but hopefully that gives you good context. Well, I mean, I think the way we think about deploying capital broadly, right, is that we have an appropriate balance sheet. We're well structured. As long as we're in kind of our range of one to two times base business, we're extremely comfortable. Certainly not intimidated by the idea of being a little below or a little above for a window of time. I think that's just good management. But we certainly are committed to continuing to deploy capital. We think it's a responsibility of management. We think it's a responsible thing to do. We think it's good for shareholders, so we're going to continue to stay committed. And we'll look for opportunistic moments, right? Where in each one of those categories, we think there'll be times when it might make sense to lean in. But we're never going to put ourselves in a position where we put ourselves at risk. We've got a lot of confidence in our ability to sort of see what the business is capable of and manage that liquidity and we're confident we can work well in that range. Thanks Keith. Yes, Adam, that's a good question. In 2023 multi-family will be a tailwind for our margin. It only creates a little bit of a tailwind though, because it's still only about 15% of our overall business. R&R traditionally has been a higher margin product as well and we expect a favorable result from R&R on our margin maintenance. It will help us hold on to margin. Again, the combination of those two products is a smaller percentage of our overall business and generally our margin profile follows single-family, but they will be helpful in us maintaining as we normalize in other areas. Yes, Adam I'd love to talk about our digital milestone. So 2022 is a year of development. We really weren't trying to monetize the concept in 2022, and actually even through 2023 it would only be a marginal revenue opportunity. We're playing end game here with the digital solution. What we're focused on in 2023 is the full development of the platform and we believe by the end of the year, we will have achieved all the development milestones. We're piloting it in 40 with 40 customers across four markets. We're going to learn a lot from that. We're going to go back, we're going to refigure, we're going to redevelop, we're going to change what we need to. Because at the end of the day, the full recognition of value in this solution is through pull through sales by making us easier to do business with. We believe fully in that concept still. We believe we are light years ahead of any of our competition as it relates to where we stand in the development process. And we still believe in our goal of $1 billion of incremental sales by 2026, primarily through pull through business. Anything you want to add there, Peter? Thank you. Yeah, no thanks, Steven, you're right. We struggled to get what we've wanted. It's gotten a little better. There has not been nearly the relief in things like rolling stock that there have been in certain other categories. So that's still a source of, I would say strain. It's getting better. So my sense is this year's CapEx will be more achievable than last year. There's certainly a lot we want to do, and we're still optimistic that that will continue to free up as the year progresses. Yes, so the capacity question is a good one. But we firmly believe in investing in the long-term. So we aren't changing our priorities as it relates to investments and capacity, specifically around value-added products. And in fact, we're trying to address kind of labor concerns a little bit through some of these investments. We have fully robotic lines in Georgia and Texas that we're still working through and trying to make sure and having some success with. And I think we have six to seven more on the books that we're going to add over the next two to three years. So we're seeing investments in technology and investments in automations as a way to really address both labor concerns we have today and in the future. So that will definitely not stop. As it relates to the core business, we've been really diligent about protecting our A and B players out in the marketplace and that's not going to change either because we see that as and what we're experiencing now is somewhat of a short-term scenario and over the long-term we want to come out of this guns and blazing on the other side with our best people. So that's kind of how we're approaching it right now. Thanks you. Thank you, Jay. Yes, I mean it's the reason you have three different scenarios there to pick from, right? You saw it as recently as coming out of the year in December, most builders were really pessimistic. Mortgage rates dipped down a couple 20, 40 basis points and all of a sudden the light turned on and everybody started showing up again. So it was really hard to just try to narrow it down to one narrow range and that's why we gave you the different scenarios. But the good thing is, we do know underlying demand remains strong, evidenced by how quickly people returned to the marketplace once they realized mortgage rates were at a rate that they felt like they could execute on the home purchase that they were after. So it was just additional proof that over the long-term home, underlying home demand is there. We've just got to make sure that we balance that affordability against that demand. I think it's more of what you just said, the latter part. I think they had a good couple year run. They're looking at fairly uncertain environment now and they're just not ready to get off the fence. I think as the year plays out and as we see more certainty as the year plays out around interest rates and mortgage rates and people can evaluate what the next 12 to 18 months look like, I think they'll jump back in and of course we're looking continuously throughout the time that we're there. Yes, I mean, I think what you described is accurate. It has been a bit erratic ups and downs. I don't know that there's a trend there broadly other than to say it's slower than last year and it's certainly a market that's trying to find its own. Yes, I don't think breaking it down at this point is going to help anybody, but it's certainly a market we're staying very close to operationally to ensure we are responding correctly to whatever is dealt. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think that's a -- I'm glad you're asking the question that way. I think it's the right way to think about it. The variables obviously are starts. Starts in single-family being the biggest impact on us, the other being the impact of M&A right? We've been acquisitive and the year-over-year growth from those acquisitions are certainly impactful in terms of how we're performing versus the prior year numbers. There's a bit of growth margin in there. The normalization will be a bit of a headwind, but we are also seeing some share growth that we've embedded in that as well. So that's an offset. So, but you know, across the board being able to offset a share, a portion of that single-family decline through the strength of our core business and, and the differentiated model is a healthy thing for us and we're certainly quite proud of it. It actually, it goes hand-in-hand with what we need to do from a standpoint of competitiveness related to slower housing starts and increasing our customer service reducing cycle times. So a lot of it is around synergies that we realized from new M&A we've done over the last 18 months. Some of it is related to payroll productivity, getting more for less specifically within our delivery initiatives and some of our truck turnaround initiatives. Some are around manufacturing productivity as I mentioned since the merger board foot per man hour has gone up 22%. That is a combination of best practices across plants as we continue to acquire value-added plants from other parts of the country and integrate them into the BFS way of doing things. There's productivity savings there. We're always constantly reviewing our indirect spend. There's opportunities there. So we, we, we've probably got six to eight different initiatives that will fund that $90 million to $110 million and we're very confident in our ability to get there. Yes. Yes, so I think probably the biggest challenge in this is, that there's no base business at a quarterly level that's, that's not a, it doesn't actually exist, so I'm not holding out on you in terms of talking about that number. You're right, there is a, there is a lot going on in the year-over-year comps and the ability to break out those pieces. Unfortunately it is generally driven by some detailed analytics. We have some top side assumptions, but I don't think they're particularly helpful to you in terms of insight. A lot of the year-over-year comparison from a commodities perspective is negative in the first half or far more negative in the first half than the second. Unfortunately just from a, the ability to break those pieces apart, so starts comp. So I think that our guide or our comment when we were given the guide saying that the first half is going be harder from a comparisons perspective unfortunately it's probably my best insight to offer for the, for the numbers this year. Yes, I've got... Yes, I mean, if I just talk to Randall Langs, I think that's right between 350 and 400 is the range a little bit below our base business assumption in terms of how the year has started, but it's early. Yes, they're still struggling as well with labor and what they're having to pay for costs of labor. But at the end of the day, the normal dynamics around supply and demand are going to run out and people are going to go after share, they're going to do it with whatever availability they have. It just hasn't been widespread at this point. All right, thank you."

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Neese : Thank you, Todd. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our third quarter results for 2022. The third quarter press release and investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during the call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Flitman : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Our strong third quarter results reflect the fundamental strength of our business, including our value-added products and services that resonate with our customers and our consistent execution. We are winning new business and strengthening existing customer relationships by consistently providing customers tailored solutions and excellent service, which collectively make us a partner of choice. In the third quarter, we delivered a 6.9% increase in core organic sales, including nearly 20% growth in our higher margin value-added products. That performance, combined with our investments in core operations, our relentless focus on cost controls and acceleration of productivity helped us produce record adjusted EBITDA. On Slide 3, I would like to remind you of our long-term strategic priorities: expanding organically in value-added products and services, driving operational excellence, continuing to build our high-performing culture and growing through strategic tuck-in acquisitions. On Slide 4, we outline how we continue to execute against our strategy this quarter. Specifically, we delivered record results in the quarter by increasing our value-added product sales. We leveraged our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System, leading to $33 million in productivity savings in the quarter. We deployed additional capital toward tuck-in acquisitions as highlighted by our recent purchases. Since the BMC merger, we have now deployed $2 billion of capital to strategic M&A. Through October, we have repurchased $2 billion in common stock this year. We still have slightly more than $500 million remaining on our current $2 billion share repurchase authorization and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares, considering market dynamics and our ongoing commitment to maximize long-term value creation. Since we launched our buyback program 15 months ago, we have invested approximately $3.8 billion in repurchasing roughly 61 million shares, retiring nearly 30% of our common shares outstanding. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered approximately $6 billion in net sales. Core organic sales in value-added products grew by nearly 20%, while single-family sales increased almost 2%. Repair, Remodel and Other increased over 30% and multi-family increased 16%. R&R and Other growth was mainly attributable to a weaker prior year when supply constraints limited our ability to support growth in this segment. Multi-family was driven by solid organic growth and a strong backlog of projects. Once again, value-added products drove our growth story, further validating that we are well positioned to be the supplier of choice for these products. During the third quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 20.3%. These results were driven by our strong execution, share gains, ongoing productivity initiatives and pricing discipline in a market that has been supply constrained, but is returning to normal. Turning to M&A on Slide 6. In addition to our focus on profitable core organic growth, we continue to execute tuck-in acquisitions that are aligned with our strategy. Since the start of the quarter, we have completed four acquisitions that collectively advance our objective of expanding our geographic footprint in key markets, enhancing our value-added portfolio to better serve our customers and diversifying our end market exposure. In September, we closed our acquisition of Trussway, which expands our footprint in multifamily trusses, accelerating our growth in the Southwest and Southeast. We also acquired Fulcrum Building Group in September, providing us with pro contractor-focused lumberyards, millwork facilities and additional resources in the high-growth markets of the Gulf Coast. In July, we closed our acquisition of HomCo Lumber and Hardware, which enhanced our footprint in Flagstaff, Arizona. Then in October, we acquired Pima Door & Supply, which provides us with dedicated millwork capabilities in Phoenix. These acquisitions represent our ability to acquire high-return assets that will boost our long-term value proposition. We're excited to welcome the HomCo, Trussway, Fulcrum and Pima teams with their longstanding customer relationships and track records of profitable growth to the BFS family. We have spent approximately $630 million on M&A so far this year. The highly fragmented nature of our industry supports our ambition to invest on average $500 million per year for the next several years while deploying capital in a disciplined manner. As we navigate near-term market dynamics, we will continue to be acquisitive where valuations make sense. We remain vigilant stewards of capital to ensure we continue to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry. The end of the third quarter marks just over one year since the completion of our Paradigm and Apollo acquisitions. The original Paradigm business continues to perform exceptionally well and we are investing in the long-term growth of that business. On the homebuilder software side, we remain committed to executing our development plan to build out of our digital sales team and integration with BFS operations. As we highlighted last quarter, we successfully integrated our structural design, material takeoff and visualization models into one streamlined process for our pilot customers. We now have 18 new digital sales representatives in place with more than 330 customer meetings held during the third quarter. And we are excited to tell you about a new technology that we will be introducing to the marketplace at the beginning of 2023, our new mybldr.com website which will provide our small builder customers easy-to-use digital tools to virtually design and build their next home and engage with key operational functions, including planning, specifying products, ordering materials and budgeting. We believe our launch of this platform will help us grow the BFS brand and build on our momentum as the supplier of choice in the homebuilding industry. Turning to productivity. In addition to the $55 million of carryover synergies, we have delivered $73 million in savings so far in 2022 and we expect to exceed $100 million in productivity savings for the full year as we drive improvement projects and leverage our BFS 1-TEAM operating system. Last quarter, we outlined the increased resilience of our business model, and we believe these are important points to reiterate in this current environment of macro uncertainty. In the scenario of a challenged market where housing starts are down significantly, we have many levers to pull, as shown on Slide 8 that will allow us to quickly respond, including effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to flex expenses with demand, optimizing capacity and further streamlining our footprint, reducing discretionary spend, accelerating productivity projects and taking appropriate workforce actions. Our scale, combined with these initiatives, allow us to operate in a much more proactive and effective manner compared to the last recessionary cycle 15 years ago. As we have all seen in the public builder announcements, the commentary has suggested a 30% to 40% decline in order rates on average. While we had very strong third quarter results, we have begun to see a slowdown in average daily sales as higher mortgage rates and declining consumer confidence are weighing on demand and commodity prices. Our September and preliminary October volumes were down low double digits versus a year ago, amid a significant decline in early-stage build products. As such, we quickly pulled a few levers to curb our costs, including bringing our inventory in line with evolving sales levels, putting a moratorium on nonessential travel, reducing headcount and overtime to align with volumes and rationalizing facilities. This work is never easy, and these are difficult decisions with respect to our affected team members, but we must be responsive to the market deceleration and best position the company to navigate this environment. We are proactively managing into the downturn, and we are prepared to act decisively to protect and resize the business as necessary. We anticipate that the operating environment will remain challenging for the foreseeable future, but we are committed to strategically accelerating our leading market position, allocating capital towards value-generating organic and inorganic growth opportunities and delivering on our overall value proposition. We are confident that no matter the operating environment, we will continue to execute well, outpace the market and create long-term value for our shareholders. As laser-focused as Builders FirstSource is on making fundamentally sound business decisions that drive value for our shareholders, we are equally devoted to supporting the communities where our team members and customers reside, especially in times of need. The past several weeks have been difficult for many due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Ian. Our hearts go out to all the individuals and families who have been impacted. We were relieved to learn that our team members are safe but saddened that a few of them suffered catastrophic damage to their homes. We stand behind each of them as they work to rebuild. In recent weeks, we've donated over $500,000 to humanitarian organizations supporting the Hurricane Ian relief efforts. The organizations Builders FirstSource has made contributions to include the American Red Cross, Samaritan's Purse and BFS Cares, the company's emergency assistance program that helps team members who are facing hardship immediately after a natural disaster. Moreover, I want to recognize our countless team members who have selflessly gone above and beyond to support those displaced by Hurricane Ian, with special gratitude going to our team members in Wausau, Wisconsin, who partnered with our local community to send a semi-truck filled with supplies and essentials, more than 1,500 miles to Fort Myers, Florida. It's times like these that we be truly humbled to lead such a caring and supportive organization. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to these exceptional team members and to all those individuals and organizations offering support on the ground and assisting with the relief efforts. We stand ready to support these communities and help them rebuild. I will now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our third quarter financial results.\nPeter Jackson : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter. We generated a record quarterly free cash flow of $1.4 billion and repurchased $658 million of our common stock during the quarter, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our financial performance reflects consistent execution, disciplined operational management and alignment with our strategic priorities. We are operating with a proactive mindset and have enhanced our already strong expense management processes amid a challenging operating environment. Our fortress balance sheet, low net leverage profile and substantial liquidity provide us with the flexibility to navigate a dynamic but decelerating market. All the while, we are maintaining focus on creating long-term shareholder value. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our third quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our guidance for full year 2022. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on Slide 9. We generated net sales of $5.8 billion for the quarter, which increased 4.6% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products category grew by 19.9%, reflecting our work to enhance our product mix and meet customer needs. Gross profit was $2 billion, a 17.6% increase year-over-year. Gross margin increased 390 basis points to 35% as we increased sales in our value-added product categories and continued pricing discipline in what has been a supply-constrained market, but is returning to normal. SG&A grew 14.3% to $1 billion, with about half of that increase driven by two factors: additional operating expenses from locations acquired within the last 12 months; and higher wages and variable compensation costs as a result of increased net sales and profitability. The remainder of the increase was driven by fuel-related expenses and strategic initiatives such as IT, productivity and digital investments. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 150 basis points to 17.4%. We remain focused on the importance of controlling expenses and driving EBITDA improvement. We executed successfully during the third quarter as adjusted EBITDA increased 20.1% primarily driven by net sales growth, a higher mix of sales from value-added product categories and disciplined pricing. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 260 basis points from the prior year period to 20.3%. Adjusted net income was $814 million or $5.20 of adjusted EPS compared to adjusted net income of $697 million or $3.39 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. The 16.8% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by an increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income tax and SG&A expense. Now let's turn to our strong balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 11. Our third quarter cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, while capital expenditures were $84 million. We generated robust free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion, primarily driven by core organic sales growth, increased profitability due to effective pricing and cost management and disciplined working capital management. Free cash flow yield was 33.3%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 39.8% for the trailing 12 months ended September 30. Moving to capital deployment. As Dave mentioned, this year, we have put approximately $630 million to work through six acquisitions. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 11.2 million shares for $658 million at an average stock price of $58.57. To put this in perspective, the repurchase equates to $1.24, nearly 70% of the $1.81 adjusted EPS change. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares so far in Q4 for $112 million at an average stock price of $61.54. We are committed to prudent capital deployment, and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of September 30 was approximately 0.7x our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA and approximately 1.4x our estimated 2022 base business EBITDA, well within our stated target of 1x to 2x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.3 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $100 million of cash on hand. We had a fantastic quarter. We achieved strong metrics across the board, deployed capital and enhanced our overall leadership in our industry. I want to thank our entire team for their skill and dedication. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology. This approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized margins and static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. We are maintaining our full year guidance on our base business sales and adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 13. I would like to discuss our full year base business and total company outlook as we enter the final months of 2022. We expect results to decelerate over the balance of the fourth quarter amid higher rates, normal seasonality, declining commodity prices and the cooling housing market. While we are seeing slower single-family starts, we expect our results through the end of the year to be supported by the substantial backlog of homes under construction. Our base business guide on net sales remains unchanged at 8% to 12% or $17.2 billion at the midpoint. Our base business EBITDA guide also remains unchanged. We continue to expect growth of 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the midpoint. Given we have less than two months left in the year, today, we are also providing guidance for the full year 2022 including total net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. This will provide you with our anticipated full year total company performance. We expect full year total company net sales to be $22.5 billion to $23 billion or approximately 13% to 16% over our 2021 net sales of $19.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion or approximately 35% to 42% over our 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecast to be 18.5% to 19.5% or approximately 310 basis points to 410 basis points over the 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. We now expect full year 2022 free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, an increase from our prior range of $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion. The improved free cash flow forecast is based on our higher profit outlook on total results and the timing of commodity price fluctuations. Our 2022 outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release and presentation. Given inflation, higher mortgage rates and cancellation rates in the double digits, we expect full year single-family starts across our geographies to be down low double digits. We continue to expect multifamily starts to be up in the low double digits and R&R to be up in the low to mid-single digits. Regarding near-term demand, multifamily is gaining momentum and will improve diversification of our mix in coming quarters. CapEx guidance for 2022 is $275 million at the midpoint versus our prior estimate of $300 million due to continued supply chain delays. As we begin to close the books on 2022 and are in the midst of finalizing next year's budget, we thought it might be helpful to provide a reminder of our ability to weather a challenging operating environment. We will provide our full 2023 demand outlook during our Q4 call in February. However, in the spirit of transparency and to give you a high-level sense of what our business is capable of, I'd like to provide you an illustrative example of single-family starts declining 20% to 800,000 next year from approximately 1 million in 2022. In that example, we believe we can sustain a double-digit EBITDA margin and deliver solid cash flow of over $1 billion, given our differentiated platform, consistent execution and disciplined operational management. We are operating with a proactive mindset and have enhanced our already strong expense management processes to tightly control costs. Our premier positioning and robust operating platform have provided us with line of sight to more than $3 billion in free cash flow this year, a fortress balance sheet with no long-term debt maturities until 2030, and over $1.3 billion of liquidity to outperform into 2023 and beyond. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Flitman : Thanks, Peter. I want to close by reiterating the underlying strengths of our business that will enable us to gain share in any environment. We are the market leader in a highly fragmented industry. We have a growing portfolio of value-added products and solutions that resonate with our customers, making us a partner of choice. We have a diversified revenue stream and are constantly optimizing our capacity and operations for long-term growth. We are laser-focused on operational excellence, which adds to our competitive advantage. We take a disciplined approach to organic and inorganic growth with a long-term focus. We generate significant free cash flow which enables financial optionality in times of uncertainty, and we consistently generate solid returns while executing our long-term strategy. Our industry is clearly experiencing deceleration versus the prior year, but we are not discouraged. We are confident in our ability to navigate through any market environment and we will remain proactive in implementing our downturn playbook to streamline costs and stay close to our customers and supply partners. We will continue to execute through near-term market volatility while keeping our sights on our long-term goals, our core values and our operating principles as our guidepost.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have a very strong, seasoned and highly experienced leadership team that has succeeded through many prior cycles and knows how to deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term. Thank you again for joining us today. Todd, let's please open the call now for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matthew Bouley of Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley : Congrats on the results. So the comments you made at the end there about sustaining a double-digit EBITDA margin in a scenario of 800,000 single-family starts. If I look at the Q4 guide, for example, I think you're implying something like a 70% decremental margin on EBITDA. I know we're kind of in that period of commodity normalization and loosening supply chain. But how does that decremental for Q4 kind of breakout between commodity and non-commodity? And then just kind of give us some comfort around what that decremental could look like in 2023 that sort of allows you to sustain that double-digit EBITDA margin?\nPeter Jackson : Sure. Yes. No, that's a good question. I think what you're highlighting there is what we're seeing in the market in terms of a confluence of numbers happening at the same time. So if we think about what Q4 normally is just in a traditional year, it's a decelerating time for us due to seasonality. We generally see a decline in commodity prices in those fall periods. And overall, the business is sort of buckling down for the win. This year, you overlay the market environment where you see a slowing market, you see a lot of the supply chain returning to normal and you see commodities decelerating into that as well as the seasonal decline. And so the trend, if you compare it to last year, obviously, is in the opposite direction in all of those categories. So what we're anticipating in that slower market is that decline in commodities, the decline in sales, some retrenching of the gross margins. We talked about that, I think, extensively over the last or so in terms of a return to normal over time. We're beginning to see all of those things play out. So that's really the dynamic in the fourth quarter. We've considered all of that in our discussion about where we think we would be at with 800,000 starts. We think that the normalized commodity prices, our ability to manage through the market as well as the strength of our business and our mix really will put us in a position to still be in that double-digit EBITDA space, considering all those factors.\nMatthew Bouley : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for that, Peter. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about pricing. You guys mentioned a couple of times at the top that there has been pricing discipline in a supply-constrained market, but that market is now returning to less supply-constrained. I think if I play with your implied Q4 guide, I take what you said at the top around volumes tracking down low double digits. I could be wrong, but it seems like you might be implying that core pricing might also be negative in Q4. And please correct me if I'm wrong there. But just how are you guys thinking about price deflation on non-commodity products? And are you starting to feel more pushback from homebuilder customers there?\nPeter Jackson : Well, I'm going to give my customers plenty of credit. We always see pushback, right? I think that the dynamic in terms of the margins and the way that we're seeing margins flow through as a result of supply is, as you'd expect, right? As more supply becomes available, becomes more competitive, and that's what we've baked in. We do think there will be a bit of gross margin progressing back towards normal. We won't get there in the fourth quarter. But certainly, heading that direction. Competition is increasing, as you would expect, and we're ready for that. We're ready for the battle as part of kind of who we are and what we do. I'm not sure that there's a lot of detail that I can provide you, now a lot of pullback from vendors in terms of their pricing pass-through. It slowed down a bit in terms of increases, but we haven't seen cuts in any material way, but that could happen.\nDave Flitman : Yes. I think that last point is an important one there, Matt. I think the volumes, the allocations that we saw for the last couple of years have pretty much gone away. But to Peter's point, outside of the commodities, we have not seen price concessions from our suppliers to this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.\nTrey Grooms : Good morning, everyone. And I have to also say congrats on the great performance in the quarter.\nDave Flitman : Thanks, Trey.\nTrey Grooms : So kind of just circling back for a little bit more clarity on that double-digit EBITDA margin you're referring to in that kind of single-family housing start around 800,000, Peter. And then also kind of going back to your long-term gross margin guide, 27%. I mean, you've talked about kind of margins progressing towards normal. Is that 27% kind of the -- if we kind of triangulate into that double digit, it seems like that's kind of the number you're pointing to in that environment. Am I off there? Or in that environment, is there a difference? And how we should be thinking about that long-term number?\nPeter Jackson : So the two pieces. The 800,000 is just an example. We want to give you a sense of where we think that double-digit EBITDA can be defended. This is all forecast. I don't want anybody writing this on stone tablets or anything, but it's what we think. I think we've got a good business. We know we've looked at our numbers six ways from Sunday, and we feel good about where we think we'll be even into a modestly down market. When it comes to the gross margins, we talked about 27% plus, somewhere north of 27% of normalized gross margin that we feel good about spending. There's a lot of question marks still about where things will settle out with margins given the dynamics in the marketplace. Certainly, it will be more challenging than it has been over the last year or two just because of the increased competition and the slower starts, but there's still reason to believe that improved discipline in the market, improved work within our organization about how we think about pricing will allow us to maintain a level north of 27%. Certainly not ready to give kind of refined guidance there. But a movement back from 35% towards that 27% is what we continue to point to and what we expect to see, both in Q4 but also in that sort of down 20% start -- single-family starts metric that we threw out there.\nDave Flitman: I would just add, just on the double-digit EBITDA margin, I think you'll recall that neither legacy company had double-digit EBITDA margins at those sort of start levels. And I think we've been talking a lot since the merger about the strength of the platform that we've built and the differentiation that we have, and we're confident that we will see that play out through the cycle.\nTrey Grooms : Yes. No, that's -- I got that very loud and clear, and you guys are executing well with all of that. So hats off there. And on that, I guess the $100 million in productivity savings that you're talking about for the full year, how volume or sales-dependent is that? And I guess how much of that would be sustainable in a year where if we were looking at that kind of housing start environment?\nDave Flitman : I'll start, and then I'll flip it over to Peter. When we outlined our forward projections and our financial plan at the Investor Day a year ago, we said importantly that we were targeting over the long term 3% to 5% in fixed cost productivity. And what you're starting to see as that play out, and we started slowly through the integration of the merger and we put those synergies behind us, and we've stepped on the gas on operational excellence, and we continue to build momentum. So the clearest answer that I can give you is we believe we are building fundamental strengths in that area of the business. There's lots of opportunity to continue to optimize what we do and get more efficient, and we're confident that we're going to move towards that long-term target over time.\nPeter Jackson : Yes. And I guess all I would add there, Trey, is that while there will certainly be volume adjustments to certain items that are volume-driven, these are operational changes, right? We're tracking them as a finance organization to ensure that there's real P&L impact and things that have changed before and after. We're not just tracing volume improvements and telling you the leverage number. These are changes in operations, process, staffing expenses that you contract because we've done things differently to get rid of waste and improve our efficiency.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Dahl : So Dave, Peter, thanks for the additional color so far. One more follow-up on the '23 sensitivity. I appreciate it's a very high level at this point. If I think about, as you acknowledged, builder orders down 30% to 40% in recent months. The lag that, that hits you with in a starts environment of 800,000 or down 20 next year, it's possible that the lagged impact to you as potentially even worse. And so does that sensitivity contemplate that? Or I guess, maybe ask the somewhat different way. That's the level. It sounds like you're comfortable saying you can defend double-digit margins. What type of decline would it take in your sensitivity to drive margins below double digits?\nDave Flitman : Yes. I think it's a little early for us to dig in, Mike, on 2023. We certainly -- we're in the midst of our budgeting process here. We'll finish that up before the end of the year, as you'd expect. We certainly don't want to get ahead of our customers on any projections. As you know, it's a challenging market, and it's changing day by day. And we just gave that example as illustrative in the confidence. And as I said on the last question, we're in a different realm of capabilities in this organization and this company we've built than we were anytime in the past. So that was really illustrative and really didn't mean to opine on what starts may be next year. It's too early to tell.\nMichael Dahl : Got it. Okay. My second question, just on the capital allocation. Obviously, you've got free cash flow to support your goals this year and really nice buyback activity. You have leverage on the base business ticking up a bit. If you're looking out to next year and anticipating some core declines in the business, while you may throw off some strong free cash flow, it seems like it's possible that leverage could keep ticking up towards the upper end of your 1x to 2x range. So how are you thinking about the relative aggressiveness of your buyback program? You've got funding earmarked for M&A. You've been really aggressive on the buyback. Is it time to toggle that back a little bit? Or any thoughts on how you're looking at the buyback going forward?\nDave Flitman : Sure. Thanks for the question. So look, our capital allocation priorities have not and will not change through the downturn. We'll invest first in the future growth of the company, inside the company. We'll look at M&A next and we'll return capital to shareholders as our third priority. However, even in the M&A front, our pipeline is still very strong, valuations have to make sense, and the same thing around share repurchases. So we, to this point, Mike, have been very disciplined stewards of capital. We will be disciplined stewards of capital through the cycle. We've got a bulletproof balance sheet. We're very comfortable with that. Sure, to your point, our leverage may tick up some. We believe our cash flow will remain strong, and we're going to do the right things with our cash.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora of BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora : Thank you. And congrats on a strong quarter. Peter, coming back to the example that you gave and whatever starts drop we may see next year, whether it is 10, 15, 20, whatever that number may be, but I'm just curious kind of how does that impact your base business EBITDA of $2.2 billion. It's not the margin, but just the absolute EBITDA. Should we think about it, with single-family as 3/4 of your total business, should we think about it as a similar drop in the base business EBITDA, should be greater, should be less? Any sort of high-level perspective on that will be helpful.\nPeter Jackson : Sure. Yes. No, that's a great question. If you think about our base business, it really is representative of the core of our operations and how it is functioning at the combined entity post-merger, but more importantly, through the cycle. So it is fair to expect we would see sales on the base business move based on starts. It's the best predictor of our business in the long run. Single-family starts, multi-family starts representing probably a combined 80% roughly of our overall sales. As you think about the dynamics within the space more broadly, there has also been, and we've talked about this a lot, a pretty significant impact on gross margins due to the supply chain issues. So certainly, we would expect gross margins to normalize a bit. If you think about the -- if you implement, as you described, a number of scenarios around single-family starts or all starts declining and you account for gross margins, there is some delevering that is going to happen in the overall business. That's the nature of the math, right? We'll still be healthy. We'll still be very strong. but there is going to be a smaller amount of EBITDA to be gained on a smaller business with more competitive gross margins. So that's broadly how I would describe it. What I would say are the counterpoints to that is the increased investments we're making in value add, the share that we're gaining and the productivity improvements we're making in the business just to be better at what we do. So there's a balance there. That's what we're working through right now and are planning for '23 to be able to give you better dialed-in numbers.\nKetan Mamtora : No, this is great. Very helpful. And then one other follow-up question. So obviously, we are starting to see cancellation rates tick up, starts come down. But I'm just curious, how long do you think it will take for builders to work through sort of the current backlog of homes that are there? Is it sort of a one to two quarter event or less or more?\nPeter Jackson : That's a great question. I really wish I knew the answer to that. On one hand, I think we've seen really nice trends in terms of those numbers of units, those homes under construction in total stay quite high, which indicates there's some cushion there. The counterpoint is a little bit what we alluded to in the script today, we have seen a bigger decline in the early products. So say that another way, if you think about the construction cycle of a home, you're going to start with your framing lumber, you move to trusses, then windows and doors, we're seeing bigger declines on the earlier products which would indicate that we're starting to build through some of that unit under construction backlog. Timing of it, tough to say. I think the most common forecast that I've heard would be Q4, Q1, we would burn through the bulk of it, but I think it's just too early to say.\nKetan Mamtora : Got it. That's very helpful. I will turn it over. Good luck in the back half and into 2023.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Adam Baumgarten of Zelman & Associates.\nAdam Baumgarten : Just going back to the September and October volume trends, maybe give us a sense for how the value-add business performed? Did it continue to outperform the overall business in a down environment?\nPeter Jackson : It did. It did. There's a few reasons for that. I mean, obviously, we've invested in the value-add part of our business over the last year. So both in the form of internal investments, new capacity, better facilities, better automation, better productivity, but also in the inorganic side with the acquisitions we paid. Both of those have done well and then you layer on the other components, right, windows, doors and millwork, that's an area we've made a lot of investments in over the past really decade and that has yielded some really nice performance and ability to compete. So our focus in those areas is paying off. We think it will continue to do that. Now that isn't to say that we won't still face challenges in a market where there's fewer starts, but we think we're very, very well positioned to compete to win in that environment.\nAdam Baumgarten : Got it. And then maybe just some additional color on mybldr.com that launch that's coming up. It sounds like it's targeted towards smaller builders. Is that an incremental opportunity to the $1 billion that you guys have sized over time? And then maybe just maybe the market opportunity for that launch just in and of itself would be helpful.\nDave Flitman : Yes. Very good question. And no, it's not incremental to the $1 billion. As we said, we bought a platform that was -- we were very excited about with Paradigm, but it was very narrowly focused again on window and door manufacturers in the retail side of the business. And as we said, we've been investing heavily in the development of that platform to build it out to be able to handle the whole house design and configuration. We're hitting a major milestone with that launch. And as we've said from the beginning, we are targeting this at the small builders first. So consistent with what we said, we're excited about that milestone. And there will be more to come over time. But 15, 16 months in, with the heavy lifting we have and continue to have on the development side, and we're excited to bring that forward.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Collin Verron of Jefferies.\nCollin Verron : I just wanted to start back with your illustrative 20% decline in starts environment. Can you just provide some more color about the organic sales declines and the decremental margin assumptions that go into that? I ask just because you're taking share, especially from the value-add products, there could be some changes in core pricing. So there seems to be a lot of moving pieces here and beyond just the single-family starts. So any color there would be helpful.\nDave Flitman : Colin. Yes, I mean, to be honest, the goal wasn't to try and get into the dissection of the sub numbers. I think that my comments that -- to Ketan a little while ago are certainly applicable here and that we do anticipate there to be declines on a number of different areas. We think starts will go down. We think commodities will continue to revert back to that long-term average. And we think there'll be some regression to the historical norms in margins. Beginning to see that in the third and fourth quarters and certainly expect that to play out through the year. But it's an environment where even with those pretty significant slowdown estimates included in the metric, we're still at double-digit margins. We're still in a position where we've got a market-leading platform where we've got investments in value-add and digital and improvements internally and our productivity is helping to lead us through a very difficult time with a very profitable business. So it's certainly inclusive of those factors. You're right, and we'll have a lot more detail for you as we get into the February announcement where we give the guide on '23.\nCollin Verron : Okay. And then can you just touch on the M&A pipeline and your strategy here just given the weakening macro environment, what kind of purchase multiples you're seeing in the market and maybe how that's different from history?\nDave Flitman : Well, we've still got a very strong pipeline as we said for a while now. Valuation becomes the issue at times like this, right? And we've executed so far, 13 acquisitions since the merger, all we believe with high level of discipline on valuation. And we will continue to do that through the downturn. I expect that things may slow down a bit here for a while. And dependent upon the length and the severity of the downturn, the pipeline may get more active through the course of time. But again, I just want you to hear and understand we have been and will remain disciplined on valuations.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Reuben Garner of The Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner : Good morning, everybody, and congrats on the results in the quarter. So the value add versus the commodity or non-value-added businesses, can you talk about what you're seeing on the margin front so far in this quarter or towards the end of the last quarter? Have the value-added margins kind of held in better and commodities kind of already returned to \"normal\" or have they kind of progressed in a similar manner?\nPeter Jackson : Yes. So good question. The margins have, as you did maybe expect, begun to return to normal, but led more by the commodity side than by the value-add side, right? Historically speaking, value-add, prices and margins are a bit stickier and commodities are just -- they move more quickly. They respond more quickly just given the volatility of that cost category in general. We would expect that to continue, right? We would expect it over time to normalize quicker. We just haven't gotten all the way yet. We've got a little bit of it.\nReuben Garner : Got it. And then for the scenario that you provided for next year as well, I guess you mentioned facility rationalization. Any more detail that you can go into there? Is that mothballing of manufacturing capabilities? Is that just consolidation of distribution footprint? Is it none of those? And what kind of, I guess, savings are embedded in that outlook? You mentioned making some cost cuts to kind of weather the storm. Is there any kind of dollar amount that you could throw out there?\nDave Flitman : Yes. I would just say that to this point, from the peak, we've taken out about 2,600 of our headcount and that peak being really at the end of the second quarter, early in the third quarter. We have rationalized or in the process of rationalizing 17 facilities. And to your question, I just want to be clear, we are not taking out manufacturing capacity. This is more consolidation primarily in some of the smaller markets where we may have redundant assets that given the last two years and the strength of the market, we have not needed to shut those facilities down. In fact, we've needed all that capacity that we've had, but times are different now. And so I really don't want to quantify any of that at this point. But as I said on the call, we will be proactive and decisive in actions given what happens in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of Truist.\nKeith Hughes : A question on multi-families. Continues to be strong as you discussed in your guidance. I guess how long of a backlog or how long of a view do you have a multifamily continuing in anywhere near this kind of level?\nPeter Jackson : Keith, yes, thank you. Multifamily is a bright spot. I mean, as we've talked about, there is a need for housing people need a place to be, and it would appear that with the slowdown in single-family starts, multifamily is certainly staying strong. And we have a great franchise in that space. The ability to invest is something that we've stayed committed to our existing multifamily business on truss and millwork we added to that with both Panel Truss and Trussway this year with acquisitions. And right now, we've got over of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of backlog in that space that we know we're going to be able to meet throughout the year.  Certainly feel good about the strength and the profitability of that business and as we bring the teams together and integrate them into a consolidated Builders FirstSource team, we're excited about what they're able to deliver. So we're certainly very optimistic in that space.\nKeith Hughes : And on multifamily, activity planning and start activity slows down. What's kind of -- how long it take to show up in your numbers?\nPeter Jackson : Generally, you're talking about multifamily being a substantially longer lead time. We usually say around nine months. Yes, it's usually around nine months versus 30 to 60 days probably on the single-family side. It does vary a bit, but that's a good average.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel.\nStanley Elliott : A quick question on the Slide 8. You talked about some of the downside actions you guys are taking. With the double-digit EBITDA margin framework that you've laid out, is that saying that you basically need to complete all of these downside actions? Or can you hit those targets where you are? And I was thinking more just from a leverage standpoint into next year, should things decelerate from here?\nDave Flitman : We didn't lead those actions directly to those double-digit EBITDA margin. That was more illustrative and given you an indication of the levers that we have to pull, depending upon how severe the downturn gets. And the Harvey Balls there just show you that we're fairly early into acting on all that capability. So I wouldn't think about those as directly linked. But certainly, where the downturn gets severe, we will pull more and more leverage as time goes on.\nStanley Elliott : And I guess switching gears on the automation side. You talked about some high-return CapEx projects. Could you help us kind of where you are? I mean I saw the CapEx guide come down modestly. What are expectations for some of those projects? And how should we think about them at next year?\nDave Flitman : Well, as we have been, we continue to invest heavily in automating our manufacturing facilities. We think that's the right long-term play. We think labor is going to be constrained in this industry and particularly skilled labor, which we need in our manufacturing facilities for a long time to come. We talked about our first fully automated four truss line that we started up in Georgia last quarter. And at that time, we said we had eight more coming over the next couple of years, and we are fully committed to that and looking to future automation potential across our facilities. That's the right long-term play in any market. We will continue outside of maintenance of our facilities and refreshing our rolling stock. That is the single biggest area we'll deploy capital into the company going forward.\nPeter Jackson : And sadly, given the strength of our balance sheet, we have the ability to do that even in a slower market. And I think taking advantage of those windows where we can actually get access to some of this equipment that we need, it is the right way to manage for the long term, right? We haven't been able to get all the trucks, we haven't been able to get all the equipment we need, but we do have the ability to continue to refresh the fleet and do what we need to, to have that equipment when we need it even right now when things are slowing down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger of D.A. Davidson.\nKurt Yinger : Just on the gross margin front, has the speed at which you've seen that start to normalize, I guess, in the latter part of Q3 and into Q4 surprised you at all? And then is that 27% kind of dependent upon a certain start assumption?\nPeter Jackson : Thank you for the question. So I think that the 27% is in a band of starts. I don't know if it's a specific number. And honestly, the 27% plus is unfortunately, at this stage, a bit hypothetical. We're going to have to watch the market and see how it pans out with the combined entity and the starts that we grapple with. Still feel good about it by what we've seen so far. I would tell you if I'm surprised on the gross margin side, just from a forecasting perspective. I would tell you I'm surprised it stayed as strong just as long as it has. It's done quite well. It's migrating down, but in a very measured way.\nKurt Yinger : Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, I mean, as builders start to kind of zero in on the cost side with the loss of some pricing power and maybe trade availability becoming incrementally better, how do you think about that impacting the value proposition of some of the value-added offerings?\nDave Flitman : Yes. We're excited about the long-term potential of those value-added offerings in any market. You think about it, labor may be more readily available. But even in a downturn, efficiency at the job site matters for our customers. They're going to be doing a lot with a lot less people. They're going to take some of the same actions that we described that we're taking here. And any way that we can make their work more efficient, we believe we'll continue to get traction and continue to drive growth in those products. And to Peter's earlier comments, we haven't seen any slowdown in our value add on a relative basis compared to the rest of the business. We think our penetration will continue.\nKurt Yinger : Got it. All right. Well, I appreciate the color, and good luck here in Q4 guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.\nAlex Rygiel : Can you talk a bit about your inventory level, your comfort with it, how it compares to historical levels? And any other sort of inventory that could be sort of out in the channel, understanding that you are most of the channel?\nPeter Jackson : Thanks, Alex. Yes. So inventory has been a real focus for us as we've observed the market, trying to make sure that we're we have the right amount on hand, right? We generally manage it on a days basis in the field ensuring that we're able to support the dynamics in the market. So that requires us to stay close to it up in -- during up and down moment. That said, I think we're in the right position. I think we've repositioned and cleared the decks on what we needed to. We talked a little bit about windows being an overhang. Certainly, we've made progress on that. A little bit more to go. But from a company -- total company perspective, it's pretty immaterial. So we're feeling pretty good. Certainly, there's always improvement, we can always optimize but certainly well within the band of where we'd like to be.\nAlex Rygiel : And then secondly, on Slide 17, that shows your estimated base business on certain commodity prices. It would appear that you didn't change it since the second quarter despite a number of acquisitions. Is there a sort of two or three simple explanations for them?\nPeter Jackson : Yes. We don't full year adjust the new acquisitions. It's just the part years. We're trying to keep it linked to the current look and then applying the normalized margins and the lumber prices. We've talked about a couple of different ways to update that sensitivity. We think we're going to have something that might be a little more helpful to folks when we do our Q4 announcement. But it has stayed the same. It has not moved materially primarily because it's just the part year additions for any M&A.\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions at this time. This will conclude today's third quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Our strong third quarter results reflect the fundamental strength of our business, including our value-added products and services that resonate with our customers and our consistent execution. We are winning new business and strengthening existing customer relationships by consistently providing customers tailored solutions and excellent service, which collectively make us a partner of choice. In the third quarter, we delivered a 6.9% increase in core organic sales, including nearly 20% growth in our higher margin value-added products. That performance, combined with our investments in core operations, our relentless focus on cost controls and acceleration of productivity helped us produce record adjusted EBITDA. On Slide 3, I would like to remind you of our long-term strategic priorities: expanding organically in value-added products and services, driving operational excellence, continuing to build our high-performing culture and growing through strategic tuck-in acquisitions. On Slide 4, we outline how we continue to execute against our strategy this quarter. Specifically, we delivered record results in the quarter by increasing our value-added product sales. We leveraged our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System, leading to $33 million in productivity savings in the quarter. We deployed additional capital toward tuck-in acquisitions as highlighted by our recent purchases. Since the BMC merger, we have now deployed $2 billion of capital to strategic M&A. Through October, we have repurchased $2 billion in common stock this year. We still have slightly more than $500 million remaining on our current $2 billion share repurchase authorization and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares, considering market dynamics and our ongoing commitment to maximize long-term value creation. Since we launched our buyback program 15 months ago, we have invested approximately $3.8 billion in repurchasing roughly 61 million shares, retiring nearly 30% of our common shares outstanding. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered approximately $6 billion in net sales. Core organic sales in value-added products grew by nearly 20%, while single-family sales increased almost 2%. Repair, Remodel and Other increased over 30% and multi-family increased 16%. R&R and Other growth was mainly attributable to a weaker prior year when supply constraints limited our ability to support growth in this segment. Multi-family was driven by solid organic growth and a strong backlog of projects. Once again, value-added products drove our growth story, further validating that we are well positioned to be the supplier of choice for these products. During the third quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 20.3%. These results were driven by our strong execution, share gains, ongoing productivity initiatives and pricing discipline in a market that has been supply constrained, but is returning to normal. Turning to M&A on Slide 6. In addition to our focus on profitable core organic growth, we continue to execute tuck-in acquisitions that are aligned with our strategy. Since the start of the quarter, we have completed four acquisitions that collectively advance our objective of expanding our geographic footprint in key markets, enhancing our value-added portfolio to better serve our customers and diversifying our end market exposure. In September, we closed our acquisition of Trussway, which expands our footprint in multifamily trusses, accelerating our growth in the Southwest and Southeast. We also acquired Fulcrum Building Group in September, providing us with pro contractor-focused lumberyards, millwork facilities and additional resources in the high-growth markets of the Gulf Coast. In July, we closed our acquisition of HomCo Lumber and Hardware, which enhanced our footprint in Flagstaff, Arizona. Then in October, we acquired Pima Door & Supply, which provides us with dedicated millwork capabilities in Phoenix. These acquisitions represent our ability to acquire high-return assets that will boost our long-term value proposition. We're excited to welcome the HomCo, Trussway, Fulcrum and Pima teams with their longstanding customer relationships and track records of profitable growth to the BFS family. We have spent approximately $630 million on M&A so far this year. The highly fragmented nature of our industry supports our ambition to invest on average $500 million per year for the next several years while deploying capital in a disciplined manner. As we navigate near-term market dynamics, we will continue to be acquisitive where valuations make sense. We remain vigilant stewards of capital to ensure we continue to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry. The end of the third quarter marks just over one year since the completion of our Paradigm and Apollo acquisitions. The original Paradigm business continues to perform exceptionally well and we are investing in the long-term growth of that business. On the homebuilder software side, we remain committed to executing our development plan to build out of our digital sales team and integration with BFS operations. As we highlighted last quarter, we successfully integrated our structural design, material takeoff and visualization models into one streamlined process for our pilot customers. We now have 18 new digital sales representatives in place with more than 330 customer meetings held during the third quarter. And we are excited to tell you about a new technology that we will be introducing to the marketplace at the beginning of 2023, our new mybldr.com website which will provide our small builder customers easy-to-use digital tools to virtually design and build their next home and engage with key operational functions, including planning, specifying products, ordering materials and budgeting. We believe our launch of this platform will help us grow the BFS brand and build on our momentum as the supplier of choice in the homebuilding industry. Turning to productivity. In addition to the $55 million of carryover synergies, we have delivered $73 million in savings so far in 2022 and we expect to exceed $100 million in productivity savings for the full year as we drive improvement projects and leverage our BFS 1-TEAM operating system. Last quarter, we outlined the increased resilience of our business model, and we believe these are important points to reiterate in this current environment of macro uncertainty. In the scenario of a challenged market where housing starts are down significantly, we have many levers to pull, as shown on Slide 8 that will allow us to quickly respond, including effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to flex expenses with demand, optimizing capacity and further streamlining our footprint, reducing discretionary spend, accelerating productivity projects and taking appropriate workforce actions. Our scale, combined with these initiatives, allow us to operate in a much more proactive and effective manner compared to the last recessionary cycle 15 years ago. As we have all seen in the public builder announcements, the commentary has suggested a 30% to 40% decline in order rates on average. While we had very strong third quarter results, we have begun to see a slowdown in average daily sales as higher mortgage rates and declining consumer confidence are weighing on demand and commodity prices. Our September and preliminary October volumes were down low double digits versus a year ago, amid a significant decline in early-stage build products. As such, we quickly pulled a few levers to curb our costs, including bringing our inventory in line with evolving sales levels, putting a moratorium on nonessential travel, reducing headcount and overtime to align with volumes and rationalizing facilities. This work is never easy, and these are difficult decisions with respect to our affected team members, but we must be responsive to the market deceleration and best position the company to navigate this environment. We are proactively managing into the downturn, and we are prepared to act decisively to protect and resize the business as necessary. We anticipate that the operating environment will remain challenging for the foreseeable future, but we are committed to strategically accelerating our leading market position, allocating capital towards value-generating organic and inorganic growth opportunities and delivering on our overall value proposition. We are confident that no matter the operating environment, we will continue to execute well, outpace the market and create long-term value for our shareholders. As laser-focused as Builders FirstSource is on making fundamentally sound business decisions that drive value for our shareholders, we are equally devoted to supporting the communities where our team members and customers reside, especially in times of need. The past several weeks have been difficult for many due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Ian. Our hearts go out to all the individuals and families who have been impacted. We were relieved to learn that our team members are safe but saddened that a few of them suffered catastrophic damage to their homes. We stand behind each of them as they work to rebuild. In recent weeks, we've donated over $500,000 to humanitarian organizations supporting the Hurricane Ian relief efforts. The organizations Builders FirstSource has made contributions to include the American Red Cross, Samaritan's Purse and BFS Cares, the company's emergency assistance program that helps team members who are facing hardship immediately after a natural disaster. Moreover, I want to recognize our countless team members who have selflessly gone above and beyond to support those displaced by Hurricane Ian, with special gratitude going to our team members in Wausau, Wisconsin, who partnered with our local community to send a semi-truck filled with supplies and essentials, more than 1,500 miles to Fort Myers, Florida. It's times like these that we be truly humbled to lead such a caring and supportive organization. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to these exceptional team members and to all those individuals and organizations offering support on the ground and assisting with the relief efforts. We stand ready to support these communities and help them rebuild. I will now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our third quarter financial results. Thanks, Peter. I want to close by reiterating the underlying strengths of our business that will enable us to gain share in any environment. We are the market leader in a highly fragmented industry. We have a growing portfolio of value-added products and solutions that resonate with our customers, making us a partner of choice. We have a diversified revenue stream and are constantly optimizing our capacity and operations for long-term growth. We are laser-focused on operational excellence, which adds to our competitive advantage. We take a disciplined approach to organic and inorganic growth with a long-term focus. We generate significant free cash flow which enables financial optionality in times of uncertainty, and we consistently generate solid returns while executing our long-term strategy. Our industry is clearly experiencing deceleration versus the prior year, but we are not discouraged. We are confident in our ability to navigate through any market environment and we will remain proactive in implementing our downturn playbook to streamline costs and stay close to our customers and supply partners. We will continue to execute through near-term market volatility while keeping our sights on our long-term goals, our core values and our operating principles as our guidepost.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have a very strong, seasoned and highly experienced leadership team that has succeeded through many prior cycles and knows how to deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term. Thank you again for joining us today. Todd, let's please open the call now for questions. Yes. I think that last point is an important one there, Matt. I think the volumes, the allocations that we saw for the last couple of years have pretty much gone away. But to Peter's point, outside of the commodities, we have not seen price concessions from our suppliers to this point. Thanks, Trey. I would just add, just on the double-digit EBITDA margin, I think you'll recall that neither legacy company had double-digit EBITDA margins at those sort of start levels. And I think we've been talking a lot since the merger about the strength of the platform that we've built and the differentiation that we have, and we're confident that we will see that play out through the cycle. I'll start, and then I'll flip it over to Peter. When we outlined our forward projections and our financial plan at the Investor Day a year ago, we said importantly that we were targeting over the long term 3% to 5% in fixed cost productivity. And what you're starting to see as that play out, and we started slowly through the integration of the merger and we put those synergies behind us, and we've stepped on the gas on operational excellence, and we continue to build momentum. So the clearest answer that I can give you is we believe we are building fundamental strengths in that area of the business. There's lots of opportunity to continue to optimize what we do and get more efficient, and we're confident that we're going to move towards that long-term target over time. Yes. I think it's a little early for us to dig in, Mike, on 2023. We certainly -- we're in the midst of our budgeting process here. We'll finish that up before the end of the year, as you'd expect. We certainly don't want to get ahead of our customers on any projections. As you know, it's a challenging market, and it's changing day by day. And we just gave that example as illustrative in the confidence. And as I said on the last question, we're in a different realm of capabilities in this organization and this company we've built than we were anytime in the past. So that was really illustrative and really didn't mean to opine on what starts may be next year. It's too early to tell. Sure. Thanks for the question. So look, our capital allocation priorities have not and will not change through the downturn. We'll invest first in the future growth of the company, inside the company. We'll look at M&A next and we'll return capital to shareholders as our third priority. However, even in the M&A front, our pipeline is still very strong, valuations have to make sense, and the same thing around share repurchases. So we, to this point, Mike, have been very disciplined stewards of capital. We will be disciplined stewards of capital through the cycle. We've got a bulletproof balance sheet. We're very comfortable with that. Sure, to your point, our leverage may tick up some. We believe our cash flow will remain strong, and we're going to do the right things with our cash. Yes. Very good question. And no, it's not incremental to the $1 billion. As we said, we bought a platform that was -- we were very excited about with Paradigm, but it was very narrowly focused again on window and door manufacturers in the retail side of the business. And as we said, we've been investing heavily in the development of that platform to build it out to be able to handle the whole house design and configuration. We're hitting a major milestone with that launch. And as we've said from the beginning, we are targeting this at the small builders first. So consistent with what we said, we're excited about that milestone. And there will be more to come over time. But 15, 16 months in, with the heavy lifting we have and continue to have on the development side, and we're excited to bring that forward. Colin. Yes, I mean, to be honest, the goal wasn't to try and get into the dissection of the sub numbers. I think that my comments that -- to Ketan a little while ago are certainly applicable here and that we do anticipate there to be declines on a number of different areas. We think starts will go down. We think commodities will continue to revert back to that long-term average. And we think there'll be some regression to the historical norms in margins. Beginning to see that in the third and fourth quarters and certainly expect that to play out through the year. But it's an environment where even with those pretty significant slowdown estimates included in the metric, we're still at double-digit margins. We're still in a position where we've got a market-leading platform where we've got investments in value-add and digital and improvements internally and our productivity is helping to lead us through a very difficult time with a very profitable business. So it's certainly inclusive of those factors. You're right, and we'll have a lot more detail for you as we get into the February announcement where we give the guide on '23. Well, we've still got a very strong pipeline as we said for a while now. Valuation becomes the issue at times like this, right? And we've executed so far, 13 acquisitions since the merger, all we believe with high level of discipline on valuation. And we will continue to do that through the downturn. I expect that things may slow down a bit here for a while. And dependent upon the length and the severity of the downturn, the pipeline may get more active through the course of time. But again, I just want you to hear and understand we have been and will remain disciplined on valuations. Yes. I would just say that to this point, from the peak, we've taken out about 2,600 of our headcount and that peak being really at the end of the second quarter, early in the third quarter. We have rationalized or in the process of rationalizing 17 facilities. And to your question, I just want to be clear, we are not taking out manufacturing capacity. This is more consolidation primarily in some of the smaller markets where we may have redundant assets that given the last two years and the strength of the market, we have not needed to shut those facilities down. In fact, we've needed all that capacity that we've had, but times are different now. And so I really don't want to quantify any of that at this point. But as I said on the call, we will be proactive and decisive in actions given what happens in the marketplace. We didn't lead those actions directly to those double-digit EBITDA margin. That was more illustrative and given you an indication of the levers that we have to pull, depending upon how severe the downturn gets. And the Harvey Balls there just show you that we're fairly early into acting on all that capability. So I wouldn't think about those as directly linked. But certainly, where the downturn gets severe, we will pull more and more leverage as time goes on. Well, as we have been, we continue to invest heavily in automating our manufacturing facilities. We think that's the right long-term play. We think labor is going to be constrained in this industry and particularly skilled labor, which we need in our manufacturing facilities for a long time to come. We talked about our first fully automated four truss line that we started up in Georgia last quarter. And at that time, we said we had eight more coming over the next couple of years, and we are fully committed to that and looking to future automation potential across our facilities. That's the right long-term play in any market. We will continue outside of maintenance of our facilities and refreshing our rolling stock. That is the single biggest area we'll deploy capital into the company going forward. Yes. We're excited about the long-term potential of those value-added offerings in any market. You think about it, labor may be more readily available. But even in a downturn, efficiency at the job site matters for our customers. They're going to be doing a lot with a lot less people. They're going to take some of the same actions that we described that we're taking here. And any way that we can make their work more efficient, we believe we'll continue to get traction and continue to drive growth in those products. And to Peter's earlier comments, we haven't seen any slowdown in our value add on a relative basis compared to the rest of the business. We think our penetration will continue."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter. We generated a record quarterly free cash flow of $1.4 billion and repurchased $658 million of our common stock during the quarter, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our financial performance reflects consistent execution, disciplined operational management and alignment with our strategic priorities. We are operating with a proactive mindset and have enhanced our already strong expense management processes amid a challenging operating environment. Our fortress balance sheet, low net leverage profile and substantial liquidity provide us with the flexibility to navigate a dynamic but decelerating market. All the while, we are maintaining focus on creating long-term shareholder value. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our third quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our guidance for full year 2022. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on Slide 9. We generated net sales of $5.8 billion for the quarter, which increased 4.6% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products category grew by 19.9%, reflecting our work to enhance our product mix and meet customer needs. Gross profit was $2 billion, a 17.6% increase year-over-year. Gross margin increased 390 basis points to 35% as we increased sales in our value-added product categories and continued pricing discipline in what has been a supply-constrained market, but is returning to normal. SG&A grew 14.3% to $1 billion, with about half of that increase driven by two factors: additional operating expenses from locations acquired within the last 12 months; and higher wages and variable compensation costs as a result of increased net sales and profitability. The remainder of the increase was driven by fuel-related expenses and strategic initiatives such as IT, productivity and digital investments. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 150 basis points to 17.4%. We remain focused on the importance of controlling expenses and driving EBITDA improvement. We executed successfully during the third quarter as adjusted EBITDA increased 20.1% primarily driven by net sales growth, a higher mix of sales from value-added product categories and disciplined pricing. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 260 basis points from the prior year period to 20.3%. Adjusted net income was $814 million or $5.20 of adjusted EPS compared to adjusted net income of $697 million or $3.39 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. The 16.8% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by an increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income tax and SG&A expense. Now let's turn to our strong balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 11. Our third quarter cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, while capital expenditures were $84 million. We generated robust free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion, primarily driven by core organic sales growth, increased profitability due to effective pricing and cost management and disciplined working capital management. Free cash flow yield was 33.3%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 39.8% for the trailing 12 months ended September 30. Moving to capital deployment. As Dave mentioned, this year, we have put approximately $630 million to work through six acquisitions. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 11.2 million shares for $658 million at an average stock price of $58.57. To put this in perspective, the repurchase equates to $1.24, nearly 70% of the $1.81 adjusted EPS change. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares so far in Q4 for $112 million at an average stock price of $61.54. We are committed to prudent capital deployment, and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of September 30 was approximately 0.7x our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA and approximately 1.4x our estimated 2022 base business EBITDA, well within our stated target of 1x to 2x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.3 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $100 million of cash on hand. We had a fantastic quarter. We achieved strong metrics across the board, deployed capital and enhanced our overall leadership in our industry. I want to thank our entire team for their skill and dedication. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology. This approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized margins and static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. We are maintaining our full year guidance on our base business sales and adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 13. I would like to discuss our full year base business and total company outlook as we enter the final months of 2022. We expect results to decelerate over the balance of the fourth quarter amid higher rates, normal seasonality, declining commodity prices and the cooling housing market. While we are seeing slower single-family starts, we expect our results through the end of the year to be supported by the substantial backlog of homes under construction. Our base business guide on net sales remains unchanged at 8% to 12% or $17.2 billion at the midpoint. Our base business EBITDA guide also remains unchanged. We continue to expect growth of 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the midpoint. Given we have less than two months left in the year, today, we are also providing guidance for the full year 2022 including total net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. This will provide you with our anticipated full year total company performance. We expect full year total company net sales to be $22.5 billion to $23 billion or approximately 13% to 16% over our 2021 net sales of $19.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion or approximately 35% to 42% over our 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecast to be 18.5% to 19.5% or approximately 310 basis points to 410 basis points over the 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. We now expect full year 2022 free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, an increase from our prior range of $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion. The improved free cash flow forecast is based on our higher profit outlook on total results and the timing of commodity price fluctuations. Our 2022 outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release and presentation. Given inflation, higher mortgage rates and cancellation rates in the double digits, we expect full year single-family starts across our geographies to be down low double digits. We continue to expect multifamily starts to be up in the low double digits and R&R to be up in the low to mid-single digits. Regarding near-term demand, multifamily is gaining momentum and will improve diversification of our mix in coming quarters. CapEx guidance for 2022 is $275 million at the midpoint versus our prior estimate of $300 million due to continued supply chain delays. As we begin to close the books on 2022 and are in the midst of finalizing next year's budget, we thought it might be helpful to provide a reminder of our ability to weather a challenging operating environment. We will provide our full 2023 demand outlook during our Q4 call in February. However, in the spirit of transparency and to give you a high-level sense of what our business is capable of, I'd like to provide you an illustrative example of single-family starts declining 20% to 800,000 next year from approximately 1 million in 2022. In that example, we believe we can sustain a double-digit EBITDA margin and deliver solid cash flow of over $1 billion, given our differentiated platform, consistent execution and disciplined operational management. We are operating with a proactive mindset and have enhanced our already strong expense management processes to tightly control costs. Our premier positioning and robust operating platform have provided us with line of sight to more than $3 billion in free cash flow this year, a fortress balance sheet with no long-term debt maturities until 2030, and over $1.3 billion of liquidity to outperform into 2023 and beyond. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks. Sure. Yes. No, that's a good question. I think what you're highlighting there is what we're seeing in the market in terms of a confluence of numbers happening at the same time. So if we think about what Q4 normally is just in a traditional year, it's a decelerating time for us due to seasonality. We generally see a decline in commodity prices in those fall periods. And overall, the business is sort of buckling down for the win. This year, you overlay the market environment where you see a slowing market, you see a lot of the supply chain returning to normal and you see commodities decelerating into that as well as the seasonal decline. And so the trend, if you compare it to last year, obviously, is in the opposite direction in all of those categories. So what we're anticipating in that slower market is that decline in commodities, the decline in sales, some retrenching of the gross margins. We talked about that, I think, extensively over the last or so in terms of a return to normal over time. We're beginning to see all of those things play out. So that's really the dynamic in the fourth quarter. We've considered all of that in our discussion about where we think we would be at with 800,000 starts. We think that the normalized commodity prices, our ability to manage through the market as well as the strength of our business and our mix really will put us in a position to still be in that double-digit EBITDA space, considering all those factors. Well, I'm going to give my customers plenty of credit. We always see pushback, right? I think that the dynamic in terms of the margins and the way that we're seeing margins flow through as a result of supply is, as you'd expect, right? As more supply becomes available, becomes more competitive, and that's what we've baked in. We do think there will be a bit of gross margin progressing back towards normal. We won't get there in the fourth quarter. But certainly, heading that direction. Competition is increasing, as you would expect, and we're ready for that. We're ready for the battle as part of kind of who we are and what we do. I'm not sure that there's a lot of detail that I can provide you, now a lot of pullback from vendors in terms of their pricing pass-through. It slowed down a bit in terms of increases, but we haven't seen cuts in any material way, but that could happen. So the two pieces. The 800,000 is just an example. We want to give you a sense of where we think that double-digit EBITDA can be defended. This is all forecast. I don't want anybody writing this on stone tablets or anything, but it's what we think. I think we've got a good business. We know we've looked at our numbers six ways from Sunday, and we feel good about where we think we'll be even into a modestly down market. When it comes to the gross margins, we talked about 27% plus, somewhere north of 27% of normalized gross margin that we feel good about spending. There's a lot of question marks still about where things will settle out with margins given the dynamics in the marketplace. Certainly, it will be more challenging than it has been over the last year or two just because of the increased competition and the slower starts, but there's still reason to believe that improved discipline in the market, improved work within our organization about how we think about pricing will allow us to maintain a level north of 27%. Certainly not ready to give kind of refined guidance there. But a movement back from 35% towards that 27% is what we continue to point to and what we expect to see, both in Q4 but also in that sort of down 20% start -- single-family starts metric that we threw out there. Yes. And I guess all I would add there, Trey, is that while there will certainly be volume adjustments to certain items that are volume-driven, these are operational changes, right? We're tracking them as a finance organization to ensure that there's real P&L impact and things that have changed before and after. We're not just tracing volume improvements and telling you the leverage number. These are changes in operations, process, staffing expenses that you contract because we've done things differently to get rid of waste and improve our efficiency. Sure. Yes. No, that's a great question. If you think about our base business, it really is representative of the core of our operations and how it is functioning at the combined entity post-merger, but more importantly, through the cycle. So it is fair to expect we would see sales on the base business move based on starts. It's the best predictor of our business in the long run. Single-family starts, multi-family starts representing probably a combined 80% roughly of our overall sales. As you think about the dynamics within the space more broadly, there has also been, and we've talked about this a lot, a pretty significant impact on gross margins due to the supply chain issues. So certainly, we would expect gross margins to normalize a bit. If you think about the -- if you implement, as you described, a number of scenarios around single-family starts or all starts declining and you account for gross margins, there is some delevering that is going to happen in the overall business. That's the nature of the math, right? We'll still be healthy. We'll still be very strong. but there is going to be a smaller amount of EBITDA to be gained on a smaller business with more competitive gross margins. So that's broadly how I would describe it. What I would say are the counterpoints to that is the increased investments we're making in value add, the share that we're gaining and the productivity improvements we're making in the business just to be better at what we do. So there's a balance there. That's what we're working through right now and are planning for '23 to be able to give you better dialed-in numbers. That's a great question. I really wish I knew the answer to that. On one hand, I think we've seen really nice trends in terms of those numbers of units, those homes under construction in total stay quite high, which indicates there's some cushion there. The counterpoint is a little bit what we alluded to in the script today, we have seen a bigger decline in the early products. So say that another way, if you think about the construction cycle of a home, you're going to start with your framing lumber, you move to trusses, then windows and doors, we're seeing bigger declines on the earlier products which would indicate that we're starting to build through some of that unit under construction backlog. Timing of it, tough to say. I think the most common forecast that I've heard would be Q4, Q1, we would burn through the bulk of it, but I think it's just too early to say. It did. It did. There's a few reasons for that. I mean, obviously, we've invested in the value-add part of our business over the last year. So both in the form of internal investments, new capacity, better facilities, better automation, better productivity, but also in the inorganic side with the acquisitions we paid. Both of those have done well and then you layer on the other components, right, windows, doors and millwork, that's an area we've made a lot of investments in over the past really decade and that has yielded some really nice performance and ability to compete. So our focus in those areas is paying off. We think it will continue to do that. Now that isn't to say that we won't still face challenges in a market where there's fewer starts, but we think we're very, very well positioned to compete to win in that environment. Yes. So good question. The margins have, as you did maybe expect, begun to return to normal, but led more by the commodity side than by the value-add side, right? Historically speaking, value-add, prices and margins are a bit stickier and commodities are just -- they move more quickly. They respond more quickly just given the volatility of that cost category in general. We would expect that to continue, right? We would expect it over time to normalize quicker. We just haven't gotten all the way yet. We've got a little bit of it. Keith, yes, thank you. Multifamily is a bright spot. I mean, as we've talked about, there is a need for housing people need a place to be, and it would appear that with the slowdown in single-family starts, multifamily is certainly staying strong. And we have a great franchise in that space. The ability to invest is something that we've stayed committed to our existing multifamily business on truss and millwork we added to that with both Panel Truss and Trussway this year with acquisitions. And right now, we've got over of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of backlog in that space that we know we're going to be able to meet throughout the year.  Certainly feel good about the strength and the profitability of that business and as we bring the teams together and integrate them into a consolidated Builders FirstSource team, we're excited about what they're able to deliver. So we're certainly very optimistic in that space. Generally, you're talking about multifamily being a substantially longer lead time. We usually say around nine months. Yes, it's usually around nine months versus 30 to 60 days probably on the single-family side. It does vary a bit, but that's a good average. And sadly, given the strength of our balance sheet, we have the ability to do that even in a slower market. And I think taking advantage of those windows where we can actually get access to some of this equipment that we need, it is the right way to manage for the long term, right? We haven't been able to get all the trucks, we haven't been able to get all the equipment we need, but we do have the ability to continue to refresh the fleet and do what we need to, to have that equipment when we need it even right now when things are slowing down. Thank you for the question. So I think that the 27% is in a band of starts. I don't know if it's a specific number. And honestly, the 27% plus is unfortunately, at this stage, a bit hypothetical. We're going to have to watch the market and see how it pans out with the combined entity and the starts that we grapple with. Still feel good about it by what we've seen so far. I would tell you if I'm surprised on the gross margin side, just from a forecasting perspective. I would tell you I'm surprised it stayed as strong just as long as it has. It's done quite well. It's migrating down, but in a very measured way. Thanks, Alex. Yes. So inventory has been a real focus for us as we've observed the market, trying to make sure that we're we have the right amount on hand, right? We generally manage it on a days basis in the field ensuring that we're able to support the dynamics in the market. So that requires us to stay close to it up in -- during up and down moment. That said, I think we're in the right position. I think we've repositioned and cleared the decks on what we needed to. We talked a little bit about windows being an overhang. Certainly, we've made progress on that. A little bit more to go. But from a company -- total company perspective, it's pretty immaterial. So we're feeling pretty good. Certainly, there's always improvement, we can always optimize but certainly well within the band of where we'd like to be. Yes. We don't full year adjust the new acquisitions. It's just the part years. We're trying to keep it linked to the current look and then applying the normalized margins and the lumber prices. We've talked about a couple of different ways to update that sensitivity. We think we're going to have something that might be a little more helpful to folks when we do our Q4 announcement. But it has stayed the same. It has not moved materially primarily because it's just the part year additions for any M&A."

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by the management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Katie. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our record second quarter results for 2022. The second quarter press release and investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they could be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Flitman: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We ended the first half of the year on strong footing, delivering robust results during the first quarter with that positive momentum continuing throughout the second quarter in which we achieved sales growth of 24% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 80% in the face of difficult comps in a challenging operating environment. These outstanding achievements are a direct result of having strong alignment around the clear strategy and the focused execution against that strategy, driven by the hard work and dedication of our approximately 30,000 team members and their commitment to provide outstanding service to our customers. On Slide 3, our strategic priorities continue to be: organically grow our value-added products and services, drive operational excellence, continue to build our high-performing culture and pursue strategic tuck-in acquisitions. On Slide 4, we outline how we continue to execute against our strategic priorities this quarter. Specifically, we delivered record results in the quarter through expanding capacity, increasing value-added product sales and increasing productivity. We continue to leverage our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System with a focus on cost containment to drive strong P&L leverage and bottom line performance. We maintained our industry leadership by successfully navigating a challenging industry and macroeconomic environment. We strategically deployed capital toward accretive inorganic growth opportunities as highlighted by our most recent acquisition, HomCo. Through July, we have repurchased approximately $1 billion of the $2 billion share repurchase authorization, our Board approved in May. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology to better appreciate the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes static margins and commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. We are maintaining our full year guidance on our base business EBITDA of $2.2 billion, as Peter will discuss in a moment. Turning to Slide 6. As we outlined in our Investor Day last December, I want to reaffirm our expected performance by year-end 2025 given our assumption of average single-family starts growth in the low single digits through that time. We expect our base business to deliver a 10% top line CAGR and a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR. Importantly, this represents an average 50 basis point per year expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points of improvement by 2025 when compared to 2021. And as we deliver this performance, we expect to have between $7 billion and $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025. That includes money for this year's planned capital investments in innovation and organic growth, along with potential additional M&A and share repurchases. We have already deployed a total of $2.8 billion of capital since we gave this guidance last December. And in the last 12 months, we have repurchased 25% of our shares outstanding. Looking at our record second quarter results on Slide 7 in more detail. We delivered strong core organic growth of 12%. Our single-family core organic growth was nearly 16%, again exceeding a single-family starts decline of approximately 3.4%. Tough comps against 2021 results impacted year-over-year growth in our multifamily and R&R segments, leaving our year-over-year growth essentially flat. Core organic sales grew 12.2%, while value-added for organic sales grew by 32% compared to the prior year period. This highlights once again the strength of our strategy and that our team continues to execute it very well. Overall, we delivered record sales of nearly $7 billion in the second quarter and generated $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA with a record margin of 21.8%. These results were driven by solid demand for housing across our markets, ongoing productivity initiatives and pricing discipline in an improving but still supply-constrained environment. As we turn to M&A on Slide 8, we remain focused on executing tuck-in M&A that delivers a high return. Over the past 1.5 years, we completed 10 acquisitions, reporting $1.6 billion of capital, aimed at building out our value-added customer offerings, investing in our digital transformation and further scaling our distribution network. In July, we acquired HomCo, a lumber and hardware supplier in Flagstaff, Arizona, and are excited to welcome these new team members to the Builders FirstSource family. HomeCo had net sales of approximately $44 million in 2021. This acquisition further demonstrates the fourth pillar of our strategy, M&A. Building upon the strong reputation and presence of tuck-in targets while leveraging our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System to swiftly integrate these new businesses. We have spent approximately $230 million on M&A so far this year and we expect to invest at least $500 million for the full year of 2022. We remain committed to allocating capital in a disciplined manner that drives long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now let's shift gears and cover our digital strategy on Slide 9. Our momentum on our digital transformation of the homebuilding industry is accelerating. Foundational initiatives such as standardizing our house plan intake and bid process continue to progress well. We completed agreements with two new customers for our configurable visualization tool. Collectively, creative Homes of Minnesota and SnapADU of California complete over 300 starts annually. And we now have customers responsible for more than 5,000 starts using paradigm visualizer. We recently hit an important milestone in our technology development by successfully integrating the material takeoff, structural design and visualization models into one process. This means when selections are made in a lock specific model, such as choosing a siding type in color or expanding from a two to a three car garage is reflected in the material list in real time. Pricing of the base house and options can be made available in the visualization experience and reflected in the material list. Our three dimensional models also provide the basis for offering Building Information Modeling, or BIM services to our customers, allowing them to gain project efficiencies by resolving construction conflicts in the digital world, instead of at the job site. This important capability strikes at the heart of the efficiency gains we believe our platform will bring to the homebuilding industry. Also, we have ongoing BIM pilots with one large national builder and two custom builders. Our pilot with front-light building company in South Carolina is highlighted on their company website and will help you understand how our technologies and services are helping homebuilders today. Turning to productivity. We delivered $40 million in savings in the second quarter and we continue to expect to exceed $100 million in savings for the full year 2022 by driving improvement projects and leveraging our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System. Over the long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement as our teams work together to leverage best practices and technology, allowing us to become faster and more efficient at serving our customers. We are accelerating our efforts in this important area to ensure we not only hit our financial targets, but to also make sure our industry-leading platform is as efficient as possible. Increasingly, we are being asked what's different about BFS today versus 15 years ago during the last housing downturn. On Slide 10, we would like to point out that the Company has seen a dramatic increase in scale and share, and BFS is now more than 12x larger and 60x more profitable than it was during the last downturn. We are a leaner, more efficient, consolidated company. This increased scale has enabled the Company to remove more than $400 million of annual run rate cost through several large combinations, including the integrations of ProBuild and stock building supply as well as our merger with BMC. We are operating as a consolidated platform, not as a decentralized organization, providing better visibility, alignment and greater efficiency than other players in our space. We've improved processes and reduced costs to more efficiently serve our distribution network of more than 560 locations. We optimized our footprint by closing 120 locations and repurposing numerous other facilities. Since 2006, we have increased our value-added components and no work facilities to over 200. That's nearly 6x. We have grown our manufacturing capabilities as we have invested in high-speed door lines trust automation and robotics, which have improved our variable cost to serve and reduced our dependency on skilled labor. A good example of this would be our recent announcement of our two-year partnership with Household Design on the development and recent startup of our first fully robotic for trust manufacturing line at our Villa Rica, Georgia facility. We have also contracted for an additional eight fully robotic lines including four roof trust lines. We have improved our expense structure, making approximately 70% of our SG&A variable. We have leveraged the size and scale of our business through strategic direct and indirect spend, enabling BFS to more efficiently serve our customers. And we have dramatically improved our cash generation, capital structure and leverage, providing us with significant financial flexibility. While we have seen strong demand through July that weighed near-term results, we fully recognize the current industry dynamics that are beginning to play out. We've heard from our customers that demand is slowing due to higher mortgage rates and overall affordability concerns. We remain confident that no matter what market conditions we face, we will remain nimble and balance any short-term dislocation, positioning BFS for long-term success, and accelerating our market leadership. Turning to Slide 11. In the scenario of a highly challenged market where housing starts are down more than 20%, we have several levers to pull to drive outperformance, including effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to flex expenses with demand, optimizing capacity and further streamlining our footprint, reducing discretionary spend accelerating productivity projects, taking appropriate headcount actions and moderating capital expenditures. Our industry-leading platform led by our strong and experienced team is generating exceptional results, which we believe positions us well for any market environment, anchored by the strength of our balance sheet with no debt maturities until 2030. We're committed to investing to capture growth organically and through tuck-in M&A. Although there will certainly be some challenges over the near term, we remain very optimistic on the prospects for our industry over the long term. I am highly confident in our ability to outperform the market in any scenario. And given our bulletproof balance sheet, expect us to lean in opportunistically on M&A in a more challenged market. So to sum up, we will continue to execute our strategy gain share and deliver value to our shareholders in any environment. Our people are the building blocks of our company and our mine inspiration that come to work every day to continue the evolution and growth of our world-class company. I want to recognize Brent Goodwin, an exceptional team member who for the past four years, has worked as an inventory control analyst at our Raleigh, North Carolina Yard and Millwork facility. Raleigh has been one of the strongest housing markets in the country for quite some time, with more than 60 families moving there each day. For the past several years, rents contributions are a key reason why our Raleigh millwork facility has become the go-to supplier for homebuilders in this burgeoning market. Beginning in late Q3 2021, Brent's location began experiencing shortages across multiple millwork product categories. Over the past two years, Brent has been relentless in developing creative solutions to help augment inventory, keeping our stock levels consistent to ensure minimal delays for customers. What makes Brent work all the more impressive is the fact that he's been able to do it all while during first a demolition and then an expansion of this location's main storage warehouse. I want to thank Brent for his many contributions in helping keeping Raleigh's builders on track amid tight supply constraints and strong homebuyer demand. We are fortunate to have Brent on our team. And I again want to thank all of our team members for their continued tremendous work and focus in satisfying the needs of our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results for the second quarter.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We are excited to continue our exceptional track record of financial performance. We navigated through a complex supply and demand environment to produce record second quarter net sales, gross margin, net income, and adjusted EBITDA. I am also pleased to report that we have again demonstrated our ability to deliver strong cash flow results by generating approximately $900 million in free cash flow this quarter. Our accomplishments have come through disciplined operational management and solid execution of our strategic priorities. At the same time, we further strengthened our balance sheet by extending debt maturities and returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our Q2 results. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment efforts. And finally, I will touch on our updated guidance for full year 2022. Let's begin with our Q2 performance on Slides 12 and 13. We had net sales of $6.9 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 24% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products category grew by 32% and highlighting our work to meet the demand across our customer channels. Although we continue to face supply chain constraints in the quarter, we are pleased to report that we are seeing signs of those constraints loosening and lead times starting to return to normal. Gross profit was $2.4 billion, a 52% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The gross margin increased 640 basis points to 34.8%, primarily driven by increased sales in our value-added product categories and disciplined pricing in a volatile supply-constrained marketplace. SG&A increased 15.9% to $1 billion, driven primarily by four items. Acquisitions represented over 40% of the increase. Incentive compensation represented nearly 40% of the increase due to higher net sales and profitability. Investments in strategic initiatives, such as IT, productivity and our digital strategy represented another 10% of the increase, and fuel-related expenses contributed 10% of the increase in overall SG&A. Adjusting for commodity inflation, expenses were 40 basis points better than the prior year even after funding our strategic investments and absorbing inflation in several P&L categories. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 110 basis points to 15.1%. Clearly, our team understands the importance of controlling expenses and has been doing an excellent job. Adjusted EBITDA increased 80% to $1.5 billion, primarily driven by poor organic growth, commodity inflation and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21.8%, which increased 680 basis points compared to the prior year period. Adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $6.26 of adjusted earnings per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $574 million or $2.76 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the prior year period. The 86.9% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income taxes and to SG&A expense. Now let's turn to cash flow on Slide 14. Our second quarter cash provided by operating activities was $947 million, and cash used in investing activities was $258 million. We generated free cash flow of approximately $900 million, primarily driven by core organic growth in sales and commodity inflation. Moving to capital deployment. This year, we have spent approximately $230 million on our M&A transactions, including our most recent purchase of HomCo in July. In the second quarter, we repurchased 16.9 million shares for $991 million at an average stock price of $58.7. In addition, we've repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares in July for $270 million at an average stock price of $61.18. Year-to-date through July, we have repurchased over $1.5 billion of stock. Since August of 2021, we have repurchased approximately 52.3 million shares of stock at an average price of $62.95 for $3.3 billion. This represents the repurchase of approximately 25% of our total shares outstanding since August of 2021. We are committed to balanced capital deployment, and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares considering market dynamics and our ongoing commitment to maximize long-term value creation. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.8x our LTM adjusted EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. Our total liquidity was $1 billion, consisting of $838 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility, and $166 million of cash on hand. We are pleased with our first half '22 performance, and I want to thank our entire team for their tremendous execution and dedicated efforts despite the dynamic environment and tough year-over-year comparisons. As we look to the back half of 2022, I would like to provide you with our full year outlook on Slide 15. Given inflation, higher interest rates for mortgages and cancellation rates in the mid-teens, we now expect full year single-family starts across our geographies to be down mid-single digits. We expect multifamily starts to be up in the low double digits and R&R projected to be up in the low- to mid-single digits. As a result, we are lowering our base business guide on net sales from 10% to 14% to 8% to 12% or $17.2 billion at the midpoint. Our EBITDA guide remains unchanged. And we continue to expect growth of 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the mid as our outperformance in the first half will be largely offset by market weakness as we move further into the back half of the year. We will continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart in our investor presentation on Slide 16 to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. CapEx guidance for the year is down to approximately $300 million in 2022 due to continued supply chain delays. Building on the approximately $40 million in productivity savings achieved during the quarter, we expect to deliver over $100 million in total productivity savings this year as we continue to drive improvements across our operations. We now expect free cash flow at the midpoint to increase from $2.2 billion to $2.75 billion, reflecting higher-than-expected commodity prices and increased profitability. Our projected free cash flow assumes average commodity prices in the range of $700 to $1,000 for the full year as prices decelerate through year-end. In conclusion, our efficient operating platform has provided us with line of sight to nearly $3 billion in free cash flow, a fortress balance sheet with no long-term debt maturities until 2030 and over $1 billion of liquidity. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Flitman: Thanks Peter. Our industry is clearly experiencing pockets of deceleration. We've all seen mortgage rates rising single-family starts forecast coming down in the back half of this year and cancellation rates increasing. We are not deterred. Our company is a much different one today than it was in 2007, and we remain confident in our ability to effectively navigate the persistently unpredictable environment. We are operating with our eyes wide open to any near-term macro turbulence while keeping our eye insights on our long-term goals, our core values and our operating principles as our guidepost. BFS is a company with fundamental strengths and clear competitive advantages and we are prepared to win in any environment. We remain leaders in a highly fragmented industry with the opportunity to be the acquirer of choice in the event of market dislocations and given our belief in the long-term industry growth trends. Our more than 560 facilities are in 47 of the top 50 MSAs with tremendous geographic customer and end market diversification. We have an extremely strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong free cash flows. And finally, this is a seasoned and highly experienced leadership team that has successfully navigated many prior cycles, and we will deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term. Katie, let's please open the call now for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the results in the quarter. Morning, Dave. So first question, just looking at the EBITDA sensitivities in the appendix, you've done $2.5 billion in EBITDA year-to-date. And I don't know, depending on our realistic lumber assumption, that sensitivity would suggest $1 billion or less of EBITDA in the second half. So my question is if that's the right way to think about our models here? I know that's a full year static assumption. So I wonder if those are more sort of run rate expectations versus a hard guide on top of the first half performance. So not to put words into your mouth, but sort of how should we think about that sensitivity and sort of the view to the second half EBITDA?\nPeter Jackson: Matt, yes, that's a great question. The purpose our original intended lease of that sensitivity page in the back is really to give you a normalized environment, right? It dials out any fluctuations in commodity prices. It dials out any fluctuations in margins outside of what we continue -- what we consider to be normal, right? So anything more than normal margins we dial out. So -- if you think about what's happened this year, this has been anything but a normal year. Clearly, we've been substantially higher. There have been a lot of displacements continuing through the market this year. We've certainly performed much, much better than normal in terms of our margins. As you've seen, right, we've guided to 27% plus as our normal margins, and we're substantially higher than that. So, I would use the sensitivity chart as just a way to come up with deltas between various commodity price levels, but accounting for the fact that we're seeing pretty substantially different results in 2022 as you come up with your model and your estimate on the total included demand.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that Peter. I guess second one just on sort of the gross margin, again, robust performance there in the quarter. But now, we've clearly seen that sort of market inflection and potentially leasing supply chains and all these things that have helped or previously helped the gross margin. So just trying to -- thinking about your kind of long-term north 27% guide. I guess my question is, as the market is normalizing here or coming down, how should we think about the kind of pace of gross margin normalization at a base business level as we get into the second half?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, good question again. That's an important part of how we think about our business and how we forecast, right, in addition to commodities and starts, it's certainly margins that are a critical component it's going to take a while for margins to get back down to that normal level, right? While we are pleased that the supply chain is beginning to show signs of normalizing a bit, it's certainly not back to the almost debt. So while we do expect it to sort of slowly progress as the year progresses back towards normal. I think we're -- we'll be a little ways out into next year before that gets back to what I would consider to be anywhere near normal, and we'll just have to watch it to see when that could potentially be.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Reuben Garner with Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.\nReuben Garner: Maybe to start on -- just want to understand the base business top line guide. So I understand that the outlook for single-family looks like it's come down about 10 points, but there's only a two-point reduction in the base business. Can you talk about that? Is that largely because of the backlog out there and working through that before you really see any impact late in the late in the year-to-year volume? Or is it share gains or improved adoption in some of your value-added products that kind of let you hold the line a little bit?\nDave Flitman: Yes, I think it's a combination of all that, Ruben, you have to point out the backlog strength that is still there. We're seeing that really across the board with our customers. We do expect through the course of the back half of the year, that backlog to get worked off. As we've said before, it takes about a quarter or so until we start to see volumes shift relative to what's happening in the starts environment. But importantly, as you point out, we've been taking share in the value-added portions of the business for a long time, and we expect that that will continue. So it's a combination really of those two things. But aptly and largely, it's based on the starts decline that we expect to start seeing in the back half of the second half of the year.\nReuben Garner: Great. And then my next question is, I appreciate the color you guys gave on kind of downside with your fixed variable and the differences in the business versus previous period. Can you talk about what your revenue gross margin and even EBITDA might look like next year in a scenario where it starts fall single-family starts fall 20% or 30% and go back to kind of where we were in '17, '18 and '19. Just kind of compare those metrics to what you would have seen a few years ago.\nDave Flitman: Sure. I'll start out at a higher level and then Peter can kind of fill in any color. But as you point out, and we commented here in the script, we're not the same company. Clearly, we're 12x larger, 60x more profitable. We've got a bulletproof balance sheet, over $2.5 billion of free cash flow. And as you know, in a slowing environment, that free cash flow will accelerate as we unwind working capital. But importantly, we've been talking for several quarters here about any demand shift or decline being short-lived, certainly relative to what happened in '07. And two key reasons why. First, the demographic shift, we've talked a lot about the millennials driving a lot of the starts over the past few years. We think they're driving about 30% of the housing starts, and that demand is much stronger than it was, say, in 2007. And secondly and importantly, over the last decade plus, we've had a huge underbilling in this industry. So that demand is not going away. We've underserved the market somewhere between 2 million and 6 million single-family homes over the last 12 to 15 years. So, we think any of that recessionary environment will power through that through the long term. So that's why we're very bullish on where the industry ends up over the long term.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. And while I'm not sure I buy into the downside range, I certainly spent a lot of time with the team working on models and making sure we understand how our business would perform in the event of a downturn that looks like that. We do think there's a bit of a buffer from backlog a quarter or so where we're going to continue to build out the homes that have been started and put under construction. Might go longer, could go quicker, but that's certainly a component to think about as you're looking at what's going to happen through the rest of this year. As you look into the future, though, you've got a couple of main components that I would highlight, right? So you're looking at those variables, it's starts, which we would expect to follow along with, right? We're going to move because we're in the main markets where starts occur, we're going to move with the market. Our margins, which are very much driven by both our product mix and the competitiveness and availability of product in the market; and then finally, lumber price is certainly influential. And we try and outline for you what that might go with -- or that might go to. Obviously, a recession would impact all three of those variables. And would really start us on that trend back towards our normalized margin level, a quick hit like that, something that moved very quickly, might put us under the normalized margins for a short period of time, maybe a couple of points below that, but we certainly think that's a reasonable range. It's a question really around what the regression looks like, how quickly it goes there and how resilient some of these markets and some of these customers are. But also keep in mind, we've gotten more mature and done a lot of work to improve our business in terms of the synergies, the productivity savings are consistently increasing mix towards value add there are all things we think we're going to be able to leverage quite well in terms of our results.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is now open.\nTrey Grooms: I have to echo the congrats on the very impressive results. So you guys have a long-term history of outperforming the markets you serve. And Dave, you reiterated that you expect to outperform the market in any environment. But more specifically, can you talk about expectations for product mix and slower periods of housing demand, would you expect to see any change in mix or maybe relative demand for prefab components or other value-added products?\nDave Flitman: Great question, Trey. We've seen that demand shift more to the value-added side of the business over the past several years. Obviously, both legacy companies were driving that, and we've certainly stepped on the gas. We think that mix shift will continue over the long term regardless of what's going on in the environment. If for no other reason that there's been such a tremendous exit of skilled labor in the industry since the last downturn, and you don't just get that back over time. So importantly, those efficiency gains that the builders are gaining from the work we're going off site will be important in even in a slower market environment because they need those efficiencies. They need to be as productive as they can in a slower operating environment. So we're excited about the shift we've had. Our teams aligned around it. We expect those product shifts to continue through the course of time.\nTrey Grooms: Okay. And then kind of follow on around the same topic here. Can you talk about how your push towards digital plays into your strategy in a slower operating environment? And how that might change the way you go to market or anything like that?\nDave Flitman: We're really excited about our digital platform and the work that's been done. Importantly, we hit that important milestone. As we've talked about the long-term strategy and the vision when we acquired Paradigm just about a year ago now, we said we would take a platform that was fairly narrowly focused in the millwork side of the business and extend that to the whole home design. And importantly, we said we would start with our strength, which was a structural design of the home. And as I said in the script, we just recently hit an important milestone where we've integrated the material takeoff with that structural design into the visualizer with Paradigm. So, that starts to bring together some of those key elements and capability that we spoke about. Still a lot more work to do but the vision is intact, and we have invested heavily in the last 12 months. We'll continue to invest heavily, we believe in the vision. And regardless of the market environment, we think digital is the right long-term play, not only for us, but importantly, for the industry because we're driving a lot of efficiency gains, and I talked about it in the script here a little bit, finding all the problems in the digital world instead of at the job site, just drives tremendous efficiency gains, and that's really at the heart of what we're trying to achieve here. And we're excited about it. We think we're going to lean in pretty hard regardless of what's going on in the world around us because we believe in the long-term strategy and what this is going to bring to the industry.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMike Dahl: Peter, I wanted to follow up on the -- on Matt's question to start the call around the ranges and maybe a specific question around second half because you think it's causing some confusion. I think what you're saying is this year has been fairly unique, right? So if you were to say, pick a number in this kind of commodity tier, say, $800 lumber, your range here suggests that would produce $3 billion to $3.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA. I think what you're saying is in reality, the margins this year are stronger so you would produce higher than that in the current environment at those lumber prices. So is one, correct me if I'm wrong there, but more specifically.\nDave Flitman: That's exactly right. Yes.\nMike Dahl: Okay. So maybe just to clear up the confusion. Can you give us what the true base business EBITDA was in both the quarter and year-to-date?\nPeter Jackson: I will say we don't provide a quarterly split for base business. We think the annualized view is still the right way to look at it as it accounts for the seasonality and the comparisons, we think, in a more rational way. I can offer up that the fall through in the second quarter was about 2/3 non-commodity, 1/3 commodity in terms of what EBIT it is to give you a sense of the type of outperformance. Obviously, we're seeing in both categories. But how that reflects on the base business side and the base business material is in there. So, you can see our expectation for the full year.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Got it. We'll do some more math around that. And then the second question, you have -- part of the increase in free cash flow presumably comes from similar performance year-to-date and some additional commodity tailwinds, you have pulled back your CapEx guide by about $100 million. And so could you elaborate a little more on kind of deltas for free cash? And then specifically the lower CapEx, what are you what's contemplated in terms of things that are either getting shelved or pushed out to next year?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, sure. I mean I'm certainly -- I think the whole team is disappointed on the CapEx side where we've got a lot of really great initiatives that we're pushing on new facilities, trying to refresh our fleet, investments and a bunch of different projects that we're excited about. We've just struggled getting what we're looking for, whether it be buildings or trucks, whether it be development, the speed of getting properties ready to sort of turn on the switches and get things going. It's just gone more slowly than we anticipated. So, we're not looking at canceling or shelving anything at this point. It's all really just pushing out into next year. We're continuing to push forward and trying to make sure we have the capacity we need to meet our customers' needs. When it comes to the broader business, you hit the nail in the head. I mean, clearly, we outperformed in the first half. That profitability on the base business and the performance of the core operations critically important to that cash flow increase, but we also saw higher commodity prices than we anticipated. I think they went up more aggressively in the second quarter and probably came down pretty aggressively, too. But overall, it's higher than what we had been anticipating. And so the compounding of those three factors, we're going to pass that cash through the business. We certainly are excited about it. It does make an assumption, one that we've said repeatedly. And of course, people can have different opinions on this. But we do anticipate commodity prices returning to a more historically normalized level by year-end. So, there's certainly a component of that that's included any time we've given these guidance numbers.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: Dave, I want to come back to that the mix question again. I mean, if you're assuming that the economy is slowing, housing starts special on the single-family side are going to, let's say, assume are going to fall next year. Presumably, the labor situation is much better than what it is today. Would you envision even in that scenario for your customers to not trade down from a mix standpoint to more commodity products? Or is that not a right way to think?\nDave Flitman: No. We -- as I said earlier, Ketan, we think we're going to continue to lead in. Our customers love these products. They solve a lot of problems at the job site and help make them more efficient. So, we believe we're going to lean in hard and the mix will continue to shift through the course of time.\nPeter Jackson: And the thing I'd add to that is this isn't just an open a prayer. The LDR during the Great Recession grew our share of business attributable to trough and manufacturer products. So even during a recession that I think all of us anticipated is much more severe than what we're looking at here. The market continued to adopt these products for exactly the reasons that Dave mentioned.\nDave Flitman: And we've been through cycles, up and down cycles, ports of time over the last decade, and we continue to penetrate the market because there's real value for our customers with these products.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. That's helpful. And then second question. Obviously, from a balance sheet standpoint, you guys are in a very strong position, as you mentioned, fortress balance sheet. I'm just curious, in case things were to the downturn were to be more severe than what we are expecting. How do you guys think about kind of keeping liquidity cushion versus let's say, share repurchases if the stock was to come under pressure.\nPeter Jackson: Well, I'd tell you, looking at our balance sheet, as you described. We've got a disciplined approach to ensuring we have a bulletproof balance sheet, right? So our number one priority in terms of capital allocation is ensuring that we're able to withstand whatever comes. So, we run the, but the downside models to ensure that to ensure we've got proper coverage. The other point is that as it stands today, not only do we have liquidity, we still have a substantial amount of capital that's un-accessed on the working capital side that we could -- it's a cushion in case things reset in terms of the valuation perspective, but we certainly have more in our pocket as well, especially given the unsecured nature of our bond. So, I think as good as it is, it's even better than it looks. And I think what that does for us is it puts us in a position to be both selective but also aggressive as the opportunities present themselves. We've been very thoughtful about the way we look at M&A. We're disciplined about the criteria that we look that we look at, the financial expectations, the alignment with strategy. We're going to continue to do that. Even with that said, we've been very successful at adding very nice businesses to the portfolio. And we think there's going to be a lot more opportunity to do that and significant opportunities to do that opportunistically during a downturn, if that's the way this turns out to be. And let's face it, we have a high beta and we're going to be smart and opportunistic about buying back shares. We believe in it. We know our stock has tremendous value, and we're going to be smart about it and make sure we're allocating capital in a way that maximize the shareholder value over the long term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is now open.\nDavid Manthey: And back to Slide 16. This is a minor issue, but it seems like the revenues across the tiers ticked down by about $1 billion, and the EBITDA range shaded down by about $100 million across the tiers versus what you had in the grid last quarter. Is there anything to that? Is it just refining your thoughts on the grid?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, there's nothing really to it. I mean we tweak it and adjust it to stay aligned with our core operating model. So, we try to move it. So, the two match up and minor things shift from time to time, but it's not signaling anything really.\nDavid Manthey: Cool. All right. That's what I figured. And then second, when you talk about the price fluctuations versus a static commodity environment, we experienced rapid and significant downside in lumber in like the fall of '20 and May through August '21 and even year-to-date since about March, but we haven't really seen much of a falloff in EBITDA. In fact, a lot of those quarters actually saw better EBITDA. I'm just trying to understand what's different about the future versus the recent past performance we've seen here.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. No, I think it's a great question, and it highlights a lot of the work we've done to make the business stronger, more predictable. But it also reflects, I think, the still supply-constrained environment. I know all of us have had a wonderful time talking about the downside opportunities that this industry faces since the beginning of the year, but in practice in reality, we're still running hard to be able to deliver on what our customers need to continue building out these homes. So I think what you've seen in a couple of ways, I think probably the most important one is around the way we've changed pricing. These changes have made our results a bit more stable, a bit more predictable in terms of upside and downside swings in commodities and what it does to our profitability. We talked about substantially reducing the amount of fixed as we used to call it, price contracts. So that's an important piece of it, why we wouldn't see as much sort of constraint or reduction in gross margin percentages during inflationary moments and inversely expansion during the down cycles. But I think it's more related to the overall demand environment in terms of our capacity, getting products to the market, having access to those products in the first place and being very careful about how we manage that capacity ensuring that pricing is disciplined and that we're moving our product quickly and efficiently. I think those things really have come together to allow us to have a superior profitability performance. Although, we do expect some of that will fade over time as we've outlined and margins will normalize a bit. But I do think we'll retain that that more consistent, more predictable profitability profile.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Stanley Elliott. Your line is now open.\nStanley Elliott: Congratulations. Dave, can you talk a little bit more about what's happening on the digital side? I mean it sounds to me like that things are accelerating or at least tracking almost ahead of expectations. And when I would have looked back at the Analyst Day, kind of the five-year build, you targeted $1 billion of revenue. I would have thought the first two years were more building it out. Maybe the last three years, you're starting to see the revenue flow through. Is that still the case? Or are you kind of tracking ahead of those expectations?\nDave Flitman: So I think we're right on track, Stanley. You're thinking about it right. We hit an important milestone in the quarter and wanted to share that. But that's part of the plan. So there's still a whole lot more work for our team to do. My main message is we're executing well the development is coming together exactly as we expected. We still expect to see that $1 billion, and it will be back-end loaded in that five-year time horizon per design. So we're right on track with where we want to be.\nPeter Jackson: But the thing I would add is I think this reflects how much the market is underestimating how powerful this thing is, right? We've seen the vision for where it's going to go. And these things that we're that we're rolling out right now, as Dave mentioned, are amazing. They're massive. They're unprecedented in terms of capabilities for this industry, and we're just getting started.\nStanley Elliott: And switching gears a bit. You mentioned the automation piece, I can guess the eight lines, you did have to push some CapEx out. I mean is that going to impact your ability to get those automated lines up and running? And then how do you think about that in terms of throughput, productivity? Anything you want to share with us here today.\nDave Flitman: Well, we've been investing heavily in automation, base automation for many years. Both legacy companies have done that. We're continuing to automate. As Peter mentioned, there's some equipment challenges in just getting things in but our strategy is sound. And what I mentioned around the eight lines, this is new technology and capability that we've worked with House of Design around over the last couple of years. And this is beyond automation. This is fully robotic trust manufacturing. And so, we had an important data point coming together at Villa Rica, and we expect over the next couple of years to buy another eight more of those lines or four on the roof side, four on the floor trust side. So we're continuing to innovate and come up with new and creative ways to, first of all, get a more consistent product to our customers and secondly, deal with the same labor challenges our customers face that we've got inside. So, it takes some of those issues off the table. But we'll continue to invest, and we expect there may be some puts and takes here or there a carryover in capital, but we will spend that money and we're committed to that capability.\nPeter Jackson: We're excited about this. I mean I think that the idea around not having all the capital that we want is really -- we're already doing 200 miles an hour and lapping everybody, but we want to do 210, right? We want to lap everybody faster on this stuff. And it's just disappointing it hasn't come in as fast as we'd like. But it's not going to hurt us. It's just maybe going to keep us from seeing the opportunities as quickly as we'd like.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Your line is now open.\nAdam Baumgarten: Could you give us a sense for how the core organic sales growth in the quarter broke down by volume and price?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, I'd say this time, it was much heavier towards price, more of an 80:20 split.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Great. And then just -- you guys did $40 million in productivity savings in the second quarter, target for over $100 million. Can you give us that number for the first quarter?\nPeter Jackson: So, the first quarter was actually satisfying the remainder of our synergy savings commitment. So, we've changed our language as we committed to do. So that first number was $32 million or $52 million -- $52 million in the first quarter. And then the remainder, the other $100 million that we're talking about is two through four and productivity specific, not synergy. So $60 million come in the back half.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Colin Verron with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nCollin Verron: I just wanted to touch on the long-term targets here. I know you reiterated your 2025 base business targets despite the change in end market expectations. So, I was just -- just to give some more comfort around those targets, can you just frame out what would need to happen in the macro environment in the single-family end market. For there to be risk to that guidance? -- whether that be from a financial perspective or a time line of achieving those goals?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, I think the obvious one is that if the market for single family, in particular, stays down and doesn't recover back to sort of our expected low single-digit growth since '21 number by 2025, that would put pressure on our ability to make that tool. I'd say that's about it. I'd say all the internal operating stuff that we committed to, we've got line of sight to, we feel good about. But from a macro or external expectations perspective, that's the one thing that we count on.\nCollin Verron: Okay. That's helpful. And then, can you just dive into the EBITDA bridge a little bit more? I think you said the split between non-commodity and commodity was 2/3, 1/3. It implies a pretty good 40% incremental EBITDA in the non-commodity business, I think. So could you just kind of define the moving pieces there? And how sustainable that kind of margin is? And maybe what you guys are looking at from a decremental margin perspective, if you start to see volumes turn?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I mean I guess the comments will sound a bit familiar, right? You're right, it was about 2/3, 1/3 in terms of the benefit that we saw in the non-commodity side versus the commodity side. We do think it overtime things are going to return towards that normalized 27% plus gross margin level. We don't think it's going to happen over a quarter or two. I think it will take a while longer for that to normalize primarily because of the same reasons we're seeing the benefit now. The primary reasons are around supply chain constraints around not having enough capacity to meet the demand and that happening in a number of different markets. So, there are obviously reasons for that to normalize. That will come through in the form of increased capacity from suppliers. It may come through in the form of decreased demand from the end markets. But we certainly think there is a permanent benefit in what we have experienced in the past couple of years as it pertains to our increasing value-add mix, the increased adoption in the industry as well as our ability to compete effectively in really successful markets around the country.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Your line is now open. Jay, your line maybe on mute.\nJay McCanless: I'm sorry about that. Fantastic quarter, guys. After we purchased in July, how much do you have left on the authorization now?\nPeter Jackson: There's $1 billion more left on that authorization.\nJay McCanless: Okay. And then -- and I apologize if I missed this, but could you kind of walk through what happened to get to the $2.5 billion on the free cash flow versus the $3 billion? That was a pretty nice increase in the midpoint. I'm just wondering what would cause the low end versus the high end, Peter?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I mean I think the biggest impacts are from what commodities did and what the profitability did in the first half. We -- and you know this, Jay, we've been very consistent about it. We continue to build our models with that expectation of a regression towards a more normalized commodity price. And instead of progressing it actually accelerated for a window of time. So that benefit is certainly real to us. It generates real cash that we put to work. So that's a big piece of it. Our profitability is up, right? So that outperformance certainly we're very happy with, and we think that is going to continue to be a positive influence on the business as we continue to execute on productivity initiatives and things we're doing to drive that profitability, and that's another big piece. And then probably the least pleasant component is that $100 million of CapEx that we don't think we're going to be able to pull in this year just given the pace of supply chain issues.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Rigel with B. Riley. Your line is now open.\nAlex Rigel: Very nice quarter, gentlemen. Quick question, Peter. At the very end, and it kind of goes back to the last question here, but you referenced line of sight towards $3 billion in free cash flow. Is this in reference to your 2022 guidance? Or is that incrementally over the next, say, 12 months?\nPeter Jackson: No, that's the guidance. So $2.75 billion, I may have taken some liberty and round it up to $3 billion. We'll continue to watch, obviously, the results as the year progresses and if there's more there, I propose we'll deliver it.\nAlex Rigel: Excellent. And then can you remind us what your lag time is to the spot price for commodities? And then as it relates to pricing in your non-commodities business, have you seen any products that are obviously manufactured by others? Do we see anyone cut prices yet?\nPeter Jackson: It's about 1/4 between what the market moves at and what we would expect to flow through our COGS. On average, it's very open. It's a pretty wide bell curve, but yes, it's about 1/4. And I guess the answer to that is no. We have not seen any one cutting prices into this market with the exception of people who are following the commodity prices, right? I mean that is common. That happens all the time, good or bad.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.\nSteven Ramsey: I wanted to touch on just one topic replenishing inventory given potential slowing of single-family demand, how are you thinking about replenishing inventory when you want to be a trustworthy source for builders and balance that against slowing demand? And then, are you replenishing now at the same rate as the first half? Or do you plan for that to happen in the second half?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. We're just running the same play. We always do, Steven. Really, this is normal of for us. Just like normal seasonality, we continue to align our purchases with the inbound flow of orders. We maintain appropriate inventory on hand levels usually on a days basis, but really down to a granular level by market, sometimes by location, depending on the SKUs under consideration. Certainly, it's something that we were careful about from the perspective you can never run out, right? If you run out, it better be the suppliers but it better not be on us. So that's a requirement. That's a commitment we make to our customers and something that we work very, very hard to ensure -- but we're going to -- we're still running the same play in a down market as an upmarket in terms of how we think about ensuring the right amount of supply on hand.\nOperator: Thank you. And for our last question today will come from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG. Your line is open.\nRyan Gilbert: First question, for me on gross margin, just given the lag between commodity price and when it hits your COGS I know that the reduced use of fixed-price contracts has reduced volatility in your gross margin. But just given what commodity prices have done, could we see that be a tailwind to gross margin in the third quarter relative to the second?\nPeter Jackson: When it comes to commodities, I would say probably not. I think based on what we're seeing in terms of performance of the business. If anything, it's more competitive, not less as things normalize, that's kind of our expectation don't see it eroding in a significant way. But yes, I mean, I think there's certainly an opportunity for increased competitiveness. If we're going to be competitive in any part of our business, it's absolutely the commodity space in terms of a gross margin normalizing more quickly than that.\nRyan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. And second question, for me is on organic growth over the last few quarters, it's really broken away from single-family starts growth, whereas if you go back over a few years, it's, I think, pretty closely tracked single-family starts. Do you have a view on when the core organic, I guess, kind of reverts back to approximating single-family starts growth? Or do you think we can stay at this elevated level for some time?\nPeter Jackson: I think I have a couple of different answers to that question. When we're talking about margins, I think we've been very, very clear that is going to return to normal over time. I think the other part of that answer though is really around value add. Value-add is an important part of the mix. Our growth is substantially higher than the rest of the business. And while there's certainly a gross margin component to that, we believe that, that is very sticky like Dave was referring to earlier and that, that is going to be held on to in terms of an important resource by the homebuilding community, and we're going to continue to invest and to be that partner for them. So, we do think that's sticky in the long term.\nRyan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. And then just a quick final question on July trends. I think you mentioned that that demand remains strong. Are there any numbers you can put to kind of quantify the strength that you're seeing so far in July or you saw in July?\nPeter Jackson: No. I think continued is a good way to characterize it. We feel good about July, and we're going to continue to be reactive and responsive, maybe better said to the market dynamics that we're faced with. But right now, we are hitting on all cylinders and focusing on our customers.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may now log off and disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We ended the first half of the year on strong footing, delivering robust results during the first quarter with that positive momentum continuing throughout the second quarter in which we achieved sales growth of 24% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 80% in the face of difficult comps in a challenging operating environment. These outstanding achievements are a direct result of having strong alignment around the clear strategy and the focused execution against that strategy, driven by the hard work and dedication of our approximately 30,000 team members and their commitment to provide outstanding service to our customers. On Slide 3, our strategic priorities continue to be: organically grow our value-added products and services, drive operational excellence, continue to build our high-performing culture and pursue strategic tuck-in acquisitions. On Slide 4, we outline how we continue to execute against our strategic priorities this quarter. Specifically, we delivered record results in the quarter through expanding capacity, increasing value-added product sales and increasing productivity. We continue to leverage our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System with a focus on cost containment to drive strong P&L leverage and bottom line performance. We maintained our industry leadership by successfully navigating a challenging industry and macroeconomic environment. We strategically deployed capital toward accretive inorganic growth opportunities as highlighted by our most recent acquisition, HomCo. Through July, we have repurchased approximately $1 billion of the $2 billion share repurchase authorization, our Board approved in May. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology to better appreciate the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes static margins and commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. We are maintaining our full year guidance on our base business EBITDA of $2.2 billion, as Peter will discuss in a moment. Turning to Slide 6. As we outlined in our Investor Day last December, I want to reaffirm our expected performance by year-end 2025 given our assumption of average single-family starts growth in the low single digits through that time. We expect our base business to deliver a 10% top line CAGR and a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR. Importantly, this represents an average 50 basis point per year expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points of improvement by 2025 when compared to 2021. And as we deliver this performance, we expect to have between $7 billion and $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025. That includes money for this year's planned capital investments in innovation and organic growth, along with potential additional M&A and share repurchases. We have already deployed a total of $2.8 billion of capital since we gave this guidance last December. And in the last 12 months, we have repurchased 25% of our shares outstanding. Looking at our record second quarter results on Slide 7 in more detail. We delivered strong core organic growth of 12%. Our single-family core organic growth was nearly 16%, again exceeding a single-family starts decline of approximately 3.4%. Tough comps against 2021 results impacted year-over-year growth in our multifamily and R&R segments, leaving our year-over-year growth essentially flat. Core organic sales grew 12.2%, while value-added for organic sales grew by 32% compared to the prior year period. This highlights once again the strength of our strategy and that our team continues to execute it very well. Overall, we delivered record sales of nearly $7 billion in the second quarter and generated $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA with a record margin of 21.8%. These results were driven by solid demand for housing across our markets, ongoing productivity initiatives and pricing discipline in an improving but still supply-constrained environment. As we turn to M&A on Slide 8, we remain focused on executing tuck-in M&A that delivers a high return. Over the past 1.5 years, we completed 10 acquisitions, reporting $1.6 billion of capital, aimed at building out our value-added customer offerings, investing in our digital transformation and further scaling our distribution network. In July, we acquired HomCo, a lumber and hardware supplier in Flagstaff, Arizona, and are excited to welcome these new team members to the Builders FirstSource family. HomeCo had net sales of approximately $44 million in 2021. This acquisition further demonstrates the fourth pillar of our strategy, M&A. Building upon the strong reputation and presence of tuck-in targets while leveraging our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System to swiftly integrate these new businesses. We have spent approximately $230 million on M&A so far this year and we expect to invest at least $500 million for the full year of 2022. We remain committed to allocating capital in a disciplined manner that drives long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now let's shift gears and cover our digital strategy on Slide 9. Our momentum on our digital transformation of the homebuilding industry is accelerating. Foundational initiatives such as standardizing our house plan intake and bid process continue to progress well. We completed agreements with two new customers for our configurable visualization tool. Collectively, creative Homes of Minnesota and SnapADU of California complete over 300 starts annually. And we now have customers responsible for more than 5,000 starts using paradigm visualizer. We recently hit an important milestone in our technology development by successfully integrating the material takeoff, structural design and visualization models into one process. This means when selections are made in a lock specific model, such as choosing a siding type in color or expanding from a two to a three car garage is reflected in the material list in real time. Pricing of the base house and options can be made available in the visualization experience and reflected in the material list. Our three dimensional models also provide the basis for offering Building Information Modeling, or BIM services to our customers, allowing them to gain project efficiencies by resolving construction conflicts in the digital world, instead of at the job site. This important capability strikes at the heart of the efficiency gains we believe our platform will bring to the homebuilding industry. Also, we have ongoing BIM pilots with one large national builder and two custom builders. Our pilot with front-light building company in South Carolina is highlighted on their company website and will help you understand how our technologies and services are helping homebuilders today. Turning to productivity. We delivered $40 million in savings in the second quarter and we continue to expect to exceed $100 million in savings for the full year 2022 by driving improvement projects and leveraging our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System. Over the long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement as our teams work together to leverage best practices and technology, allowing us to become faster and more efficient at serving our customers. We are accelerating our efforts in this important area to ensure we not only hit our financial targets, but to also make sure our industry-leading platform is as efficient as possible. Increasingly, we are being asked what's different about BFS today versus 15 years ago during the last housing downturn. On Slide 10, we would like to point out that the Company has seen a dramatic increase in scale and share, and BFS is now more than 12x larger and 60x more profitable than it was during the last downturn. We are a leaner, more efficient, consolidated company. This increased scale has enabled the Company to remove more than $400 million of annual run rate cost through several large combinations, including the integrations of ProBuild and stock building supply as well as our merger with BMC. We are operating as a consolidated platform, not as a decentralized organization, providing better visibility, alignment and greater efficiency than other players in our space. We've improved processes and reduced costs to more efficiently serve our distribution network of more than 560 locations. We optimized our footprint by closing 120 locations and repurposing numerous other facilities. Since 2006, we have increased our value-added components and no work facilities to over 200. That's nearly 6x. We have grown our manufacturing capabilities as we have invested in high-speed door lines trust automation and robotics, which have improved our variable cost to serve and reduced our dependency on skilled labor. A good example of this would be our recent announcement of our two-year partnership with Household Design on the development and recent startup of our first fully robotic for trust manufacturing line at our Villa Rica, Georgia facility. We have also contracted for an additional eight fully robotic lines including four roof trust lines. We have improved our expense structure, making approximately 70% of our SG&A variable. We have leveraged the size and scale of our business through strategic direct and indirect spend, enabling BFS to more efficiently serve our customers. And we have dramatically improved our cash generation, capital structure and leverage, providing us with significant financial flexibility. While we have seen strong demand through July that weighed near-term results, we fully recognize the current industry dynamics that are beginning to play out. We've heard from our customers that demand is slowing due to higher mortgage rates and overall affordability concerns. We remain confident that no matter what market conditions we face, we will remain nimble and balance any short-term dislocation, positioning BFS for long-term success, and accelerating our market leadership. Turning to Slide 11. In the scenario of a highly challenged market where housing starts are down more than 20%, we have several levers to pull to drive outperformance, including effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to flex expenses with demand, optimizing capacity and further streamlining our footprint, reducing discretionary spend accelerating productivity projects, taking appropriate headcount actions and moderating capital expenditures. Our industry-leading platform led by our strong and experienced team is generating exceptional results, which we believe positions us well for any market environment, anchored by the strength of our balance sheet with no debt maturities until 2030. We're committed to investing to capture growth organically and through tuck-in M&A. Although there will certainly be some challenges over the near term, we remain very optimistic on the prospects for our industry over the long term. I am highly confident in our ability to outperform the market in any scenario. And given our bulletproof balance sheet, expect us to lean in opportunistically on M&A in a more challenged market. So to sum up, we will continue to execute our strategy gain share and deliver value to our shareholders in any environment. Our people are the building blocks of our company and our mine inspiration that come to work every day to continue the evolution and growth of our world-class company. I want to recognize Brent Goodwin, an exceptional team member who for the past four years, has worked as an inventory control analyst at our Raleigh, North Carolina Yard and Millwork facility. Raleigh has been one of the strongest housing markets in the country for quite some time, with more than 60 families moving there each day. For the past several years, rents contributions are a key reason why our Raleigh millwork facility has become the go-to supplier for homebuilders in this burgeoning market. Beginning in late Q3 2021, Brent's location began experiencing shortages across multiple millwork product categories. Over the past two years, Brent has been relentless in developing creative solutions to help augment inventory, keeping our stock levels consistent to ensure minimal delays for customers. What makes Brent work all the more impressive is the fact that he's been able to do it all while during first a demolition and then an expansion of this location's main storage warehouse. I want to thank Brent for his many contributions in helping keeping Raleigh's builders on track amid tight supply constraints and strong homebuyer demand. We are fortunate to have Brent on our team. And I again want to thank all of our team members for their continued tremendous work and focus in satisfying the needs of our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results for the second quarter. Thanks Peter. Our industry is clearly experiencing pockets of deceleration. We've all seen mortgage rates rising single-family starts forecast coming down in the back half of this year and cancellation rates increasing. We are not deterred. Our company is a much different one today than it was in 2007, and we remain confident in our ability to effectively navigate the persistently unpredictable environment. We are operating with our eyes wide open to any near-term macro turbulence while keeping our eye insights on our long-term goals, our core values and our operating principles as our guidepost. BFS is a company with fundamental strengths and clear competitive advantages and we are prepared to win in any environment. We remain leaders in a highly fragmented industry with the opportunity to be the acquirer of choice in the event of market dislocations and given our belief in the long-term industry growth trends. Our more than 560 facilities are in 47 of the top 50 MSAs with tremendous geographic customer and end market diversification. We have an extremely strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong free cash flows. And finally, this is a seasoned and highly experienced leadership team that has successfully navigated many prior cycles, and we will deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term. Katie, let's please open the call now for questions. Yes, I think it's a combination of all that, Ruben, you have to point out the backlog strength that is still there. We're seeing that really across the board with our customers. We do expect through the course of the back half of the year, that backlog to get worked off. As we've said before, it takes about a quarter or so until we start to see volumes shift relative to what's happening in the starts environment. But importantly, as you point out, we've been taking share in the value-added portions of the business for a long time, and we expect that that will continue. So it's a combination really of those two things. But aptly and largely, it's based on the starts decline that we expect to start seeing in the back half of the second half of the year. Sure. I'll start out at a higher level and then Peter can kind of fill in any color. But as you point out, and we commented here in the script, we're not the same company. Clearly, we're 12x larger, 60x more profitable. We've got a bulletproof balance sheet, over $2.5 billion of free cash flow. And as you know, in a slowing environment, that free cash flow will accelerate as we unwind working capital. But importantly, we've been talking for several quarters here about any demand shift or decline being short-lived, certainly relative to what happened in '07. And two key reasons why. First, the demographic shift, we've talked a lot about the millennials driving a lot of the starts over the past few years. We think they're driving about 30% of the housing starts, and that demand is much stronger than it was, say, in 2007. And secondly and importantly, over the last decade plus, we've had a huge underbilling in this industry. So that demand is not going away. We've underserved the market somewhere between 2 million and 6 million single-family homes over the last 12 to 15 years. So, we think any of that recessionary environment will power through that through the long term. So that's why we're very bullish on where the industry ends up over the long term. Great question, Trey. We've seen that demand shift more to the value-added side of the business over the past several years. Obviously, both legacy companies were driving that, and we've certainly stepped on the gas. We think that mix shift will continue over the long term regardless of what's going on in the environment. If for no other reason that there's been such a tremendous exit of skilled labor in the industry since the last downturn, and you don't just get that back over time. So importantly, those efficiency gains that the builders are gaining from the work we're going off site will be important in even in a slower market environment because they need those efficiencies. They need to be as productive as they can in a slower operating environment. So we're excited about the shift we've had. Our teams aligned around it. We expect those product shifts to continue through the course of time. We're really excited about our digital platform and the work that's been done. Importantly, we hit that important milestone. As we've talked about the long-term strategy and the vision when we acquired Paradigm just about a year ago now, we said we would take a platform that was fairly narrowly focused in the millwork side of the business and extend that to the whole home design. And importantly, we said we would start with our strength, which was a structural design of the home. And as I said in the script, we just recently hit an important milestone where we've integrated the material takeoff with that structural design into the visualizer with Paradigm. So, that starts to bring together some of those key elements and capability that we spoke about. Still a lot more work to do but the vision is intact, and we have invested heavily in the last 12 months. We'll continue to invest heavily, we believe in the vision. And regardless of the market environment, we think digital is the right long-term play, not only for us, but importantly, for the industry because we're driving a lot of efficiency gains, and I talked about it in the script here a little bit, finding all the problems in the digital world instead of at the job site, just drives tremendous efficiency gains, and that's really at the heart of what we're trying to achieve here. And we're excited about it. We think we're going to lean in pretty hard regardless of what's going on in the world around us because we believe in the long-term strategy and what this is going to bring to the industry. That's exactly right. Yes. No. We -- as I said earlier, Ketan, we think we're going to continue to lead in. Our customers love these products. They solve a lot of problems at the job site and help make them more efficient. So, we believe we're going to lean in hard and the mix will continue to shift through the course of time. And we've been through cycles, up and down cycles, ports of time over the last decade, and we continue to penetrate the market because there's real value for our customers with these products. So I think we're right on track, Stanley. You're thinking about it right. We hit an important milestone in the quarter and wanted to share that. But that's part of the plan. So there's still a whole lot more work for our team to do. My main message is we're executing well the development is coming together exactly as we expected. We still expect to see that $1 billion, and it will be back-end loaded in that five-year time horizon per design. So we're right on track with where we want to be. Well, we've been investing heavily in automation, base automation for many years. Both legacy companies have done that. We're continuing to automate. As Peter mentioned, there's some equipment challenges in just getting things in but our strategy is sound. And what I mentioned around the eight lines, this is new technology and capability that we've worked with House of Design around over the last couple of years. And this is beyond automation. This is fully robotic trust manufacturing. And so, we had an important data point coming together at Villa Rica, and we expect over the next couple of years to buy another eight more of those lines or four on the roof side, four on the floor trust side. So we're continuing to innovate and come up with new and creative ways to, first of all, get a more consistent product to our customers and secondly, deal with the same labor challenges our customers face that we've got inside. So, it takes some of those issues off the table. But we'll continue to invest, and we expect there may be some puts and takes here or there a carryover in capital, but we will spend that money and we're committed to that capability."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We are excited to continue our exceptional track record of financial performance. We navigated through a complex supply and demand environment to produce record second quarter net sales, gross margin, net income, and adjusted EBITDA. I am also pleased to report that we have again demonstrated our ability to deliver strong cash flow results by generating approximately $900 million in free cash flow this quarter. Our accomplishments have come through disciplined operational management and solid execution of our strategic priorities. At the same time, we further strengthened our balance sheet by extending debt maturities and returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our Q2 results. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment efforts. And finally, I will touch on our updated guidance for full year 2022. Let's begin with our Q2 performance on Slides 12 and 13. We had net sales of $6.9 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 24% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products category grew by 32% and highlighting our work to meet the demand across our customer channels. Although we continue to face supply chain constraints in the quarter, we are pleased to report that we are seeing signs of those constraints loosening and lead times starting to return to normal. Gross profit was $2.4 billion, a 52% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The gross margin increased 640 basis points to 34.8%, primarily driven by increased sales in our value-added product categories and disciplined pricing in a volatile supply-constrained marketplace. SG&A increased 15.9% to $1 billion, driven primarily by four items. Acquisitions represented over 40% of the increase. Incentive compensation represented nearly 40% of the increase due to higher net sales and profitability. Investments in strategic initiatives, such as IT, productivity and our digital strategy represented another 10% of the increase, and fuel-related expenses contributed 10% of the increase in overall SG&A. Adjusting for commodity inflation, expenses were 40 basis points better than the prior year even after funding our strategic investments and absorbing inflation in several P&L categories. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 110 basis points to 15.1%. Clearly, our team understands the importance of controlling expenses and has been doing an excellent job. Adjusted EBITDA increased 80% to $1.5 billion, primarily driven by poor organic growth, commodity inflation and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21.8%, which increased 680 basis points compared to the prior year period. Adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $6.26 of adjusted earnings per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $574 million or $2.76 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the prior year period. The 86.9% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income taxes and to SG&A expense. Now let's turn to cash flow on Slide 14. Our second quarter cash provided by operating activities was $947 million, and cash used in investing activities was $258 million. We generated free cash flow of approximately $900 million, primarily driven by core organic growth in sales and commodity inflation. Moving to capital deployment. This year, we have spent approximately $230 million on our M&A transactions, including our most recent purchase of HomCo in July. In the second quarter, we repurchased 16.9 million shares for $991 million at an average stock price of $58.7. In addition, we've repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares in July for $270 million at an average stock price of $61.18. Year-to-date through July, we have repurchased over $1.5 billion of stock. Since August of 2021, we have repurchased approximately 52.3 million shares of stock at an average price of $62.95 for $3.3 billion. This represents the repurchase of approximately 25% of our total shares outstanding since August of 2021. We are committed to balanced capital deployment, and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares considering market dynamics and our ongoing commitment to maximize long-term value creation. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.8x our LTM adjusted EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. Our total liquidity was $1 billion, consisting of $838 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility, and $166 million of cash on hand. We are pleased with our first half '22 performance, and I want to thank our entire team for their tremendous execution and dedicated efforts despite the dynamic environment and tough year-over-year comparisons. As we look to the back half of 2022, I would like to provide you with our full year outlook on Slide 15. Given inflation, higher interest rates for mortgages and cancellation rates in the mid-teens, we now expect full year single-family starts across our geographies to be down mid-single digits. We expect multifamily starts to be up in the low double digits and R&R projected to be up in the low- to mid-single digits. As a result, we are lowering our base business guide on net sales from 10% to 14% to 8% to 12% or $17.2 billion at the midpoint. Our EBITDA guide remains unchanged. And we continue to expect growth of 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the mid as our outperformance in the first half will be largely offset by market weakness as we move further into the back half of the year. We will continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart in our investor presentation on Slide 16 to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. CapEx guidance for the year is down to approximately $300 million in 2022 due to continued supply chain delays. Building on the approximately $40 million in productivity savings achieved during the quarter, we expect to deliver over $100 million in total productivity savings this year as we continue to drive improvements across our operations. We now expect free cash flow at the midpoint to increase from $2.2 billion to $2.75 billion, reflecting higher-than-expected commodity prices and increased profitability. Our projected free cash flow assumes average commodity prices in the range of $700 to $1,000 for the full year as prices decelerate through year-end. In conclusion, our efficient operating platform has provided us with line of sight to nearly $3 billion in free cash flow, a fortress balance sheet with no long-term debt maturities until 2030 and over $1 billion of liquidity. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Matt, yes, that's a great question. The purpose our original intended lease of that sensitivity page in the back is really to give you a normalized environment, right? It dials out any fluctuations in commodity prices. It dials out any fluctuations in margins outside of what we continue -- what we consider to be normal, right? So anything more than normal margins we dial out. So -- if you think about what's happened this year, this has been anything but a normal year. Clearly, we've been substantially higher. There have been a lot of displacements continuing through the market this year. We've certainly performed much, much better than normal in terms of our margins. As you've seen, right, we've guided to 27% plus as our normal margins, and we're substantially higher than that. So, I would use the sensitivity chart as just a way to come up with deltas between various commodity price levels, but accounting for the fact that we're seeing pretty substantially different results in 2022 as you come up with your model and your estimate on the total included demand. Yes, good question again. That's an important part of how we think about our business and how we forecast, right, in addition to commodities and starts, it's certainly margins that are a critical component it's going to take a while for margins to get back down to that normal level, right? While we are pleased that the supply chain is beginning to show signs of normalizing a bit, it's certainly not back to the almost debt. So while we do expect it to sort of slowly progress as the year progresses back towards normal. I think we're -- we'll be a little ways out into next year before that gets back to what I would consider to be anywhere near normal, and we'll just have to watch it to see when that could potentially be. Yes. And while I'm not sure I buy into the downside range, I certainly spent a lot of time with the team working on models and making sure we understand how our business would perform in the event of a downturn that looks like that. We do think there's a bit of a buffer from backlog a quarter or so where we're going to continue to build out the homes that have been started and put under construction. Might go longer, could go quicker, but that's certainly a component to think about as you're looking at what's going to happen through the rest of this year. As you look into the future, though, you've got a couple of main components that I would highlight, right? So you're looking at those variables, it's starts, which we would expect to follow along with, right? We're going to move because we're in the main markets where starts occur, we're going to move with the market. Our margins, which are very much driven by both our product mix and the competitiveness and availability of product in the market; and then finally, lumber price is certainly influential. And we try and outline for you what that might go with -- or that might go to. Obviously, a recession would impact all three of those variables. And would really start us on that trend back towards our normalized margin level, a quick hit like that, something that moved very quickly, might put us under the normalized margins for a short period of time, maybe a couple of points below that, but we certainly think that's a reasonable range. It's a question really around what the regression looks like, how quickly it goes there and how resilient some of these markets and some of these customers are. But also keep in mind, we've gotten more mature and done a lot of work to improve our business in terms of the synergies, the productivity savings are consistently increasing mix towards value add there are all things we think we're going to be able to leverage quite well in terms of our results. I will say we don't provide a quarterly split for base business. We think the annualized view is still the right way to look at it as it accounts for the seasonality and the comparisons, we think, in a more rational way. I can offer up that the fall through in the second quarter was about 2/3 non-commodity, 1/3 commodity in terms of what EBIT it is to give you a sense of the type of outperformance. Obviously, we're seeing in both categories. But how that reflects on the base business side and the base business material is in there. So, you can see our expectation for the full year. Yes, sure. I mean I'm certainly -- I think the whole team is disappointed on the CapEx side where we've got a lot of really great initiatives that we're pushing on new facilities, trying to refresh our fleet, investments and a bunch of different projects that we're excited about. We've just struggled getting what we're looking for, whether it be buildings or trucks, whether it be development, the speed of getting properties ready to sort of turn on the switches and get things going. It's just gone more slowly than we anticipated. So, we're not looking at canceling or shelving anything at this point. It's all really just pushing out into next year. We're continuing to push forward and trying to make sure we have the capacity we need to meet our customers' needs. When it comes to the broader business, you hit the nail in the head. I mean, clearly, we outperformed in the first half. That profitability on the base business and the performance of the core operations critically important to that cash flow increase, but we also saw higher commodity prices than we anticipated. I think they went up more aggressively in the second quarter and probably came down pretty aggressively, too. But overall, it's higher than what we had been anticipating. And so the compounding of those three factors, we're going to pass that cash through the business. We certainly are excited about it. It does make an assumption, one that we've said repeatedly. And of course, people can have different opinions on this. But we do anticipate commodity prices returning to a more historically normalized level by year-end. So, there's certainly a component of that that's included any time we've given these guidance numbers. And the thing I'd add to that is this isn't just an open a prayer. The LDR during the Great Recession grew our share of business attributable to trough and manufacturer products. So even during a recession that I think all of us anticipated is much more severe than what we're looking at here. The market continued to adopt these products for exactly the reasons that Dave mentioned. Well, I'd tell you, looking at our balance sheet, as you described. We've got a disciplined approach to ensuring we have a bulletproof balance sheet, right? So our number one priority in terms of capital allocation is ensuring that we're able to withstand whatever comes. So, we run the, but the downside models to ensure that to ensure we've got proper coverage. The other point is that as it stands today, not only do we have liquidity, we still have a substantial amount of capital that's un-accessed on the working capital side that we could -- it's a cushion in case things reset in terms of the valuation perspective, but we certainly have more in our pocket as well, especially given the unsecured nature of our bond. So, I think as good as it is, it's even better than it looks. And I think what that does for us is it puts us in a position to be both selective but also aggressive as the opportunities present themselves. We've been very thoughtful about the way we look at M&A. We're disciplined about the criteria that we look that we look at, the financial expectations, the alignment with strategy. We're going to continue to do that. Even with that said, we've been very successful at adding very nice businesses to the portfolio. And we think there's going to be a lot more opportunity to do that and significant opportunities to do that opportunistically during a downturn, if that's the way this turns out to be. And let's face it, we have a high beta and we're going to be smart and opportunistic about buying back shares. We believe in it. We know our stock has tremendous value, and we're going to be smart about it and make sure we're allocating capital in a way that maximize the shareholder value over the long term. Yes, there's nothing really to it. I mean we tweak it and adjust it to stay aligned with our core operating model. So, we try to move it. So, the two match up and minor things shift from time to time, but it's not signaling anything really. Yes. No, I think it's a great question, and it highlights a lot of the work we've done to make the business stronger, more predictable. But it also reflects, I think, the still supply-constrained environment. I know all of us have had a wonderful time talking about the downside opportunities that this industry faces since the beginning of the year, but in practice in reality, we're still running hard to be able to deliver on what our customers need to continue building out these homes. So I think what you've seen in a couple of ways, I think probably the most important one is around the way we've changed pricing. These changes have made our results a bit more stable, a bit more predictable in terms of upside and downside swings in commodities and what it does to our profitability. We talked about substantially reducing the amount of fixed as we used to call it, price contracts. So that's an important piece of it, why we wouldn't see as much sort of constraint or reduction in gross margin percentages during inflationary moments and inversely expansion during the down cycles. But I think it's more related to the overall demand environment in terms of our capacity, getting products to the market, having access to those products in the first place and being very careful about how we manage that capacity ensuring that pricing is disciplined and that we're moving our product quickly and efficiently. I think those things really have come together to allow us to have a superior profitability performance. Although, we do expect some of that will fade over time as we've outlined and margins will normalize a bit. But I do think we'll retain that that more consistent, more predictable profitability profile. But the thing I would add is I think this reflects how much the market is underestimating how powerful this thing is, right? We've seen the vision for where it's going to go. And these things that we're that we're rolling out right now, as Dave mentioned, are amazing. They're massive. They're unprecedented in terms of capabilities for this industry, and we're just getting started. We're excited about this. I mean I think that the idea around not having all the capital that we want is really -- we're already doing 200 miles an hour and lapping everybody, but we want to do 210, right? We want to lap everybody faster on this stuff. And it's just disappointing it hasn't come in as fast as we'd like. But it's not going to hurt us. It's just maybe going to keep us from seeing the opportunities as quickly as we'd like. Yes, I'd say this time, it was much heavier towards price, more of an 80:20 split. So, the first quarter was actually satisfying the remainder of our synergy savings commitment. So, we've changed our language as we committed to do. So that first number was $32 million or $52 million -- $52 million in the first quarter. And then the remainder, the other $100 million that we're talking about is two through four and productivity specific, not synergy. So $60 million come in the back half. Yes, I think the obvious one is that if the market for single family, in particular, stays down and doesn't recover back to sort of our expected low single-digit growth since '21 number by 2025, that would put pressure on our ability to make that tool. I'd say that's about it. I'd say all the internal operating stuff that we committed to, we've got line of sight to, we feel good about. But from a macro or external expectations perspective, that's the one thing that we count on. Yes. I mean I guess the comments will sound a bit familiar, right? You're right, it was about 2/3, 1/3 in terms of the benefit that we saw in the non-commodity side versus the commodity side. We do think it overtime things are going to return towards that normalized 27% plus gross margin level. We don't think it's going to happen over a quarter or two. I think it will take a while longer for that to normalize primarily because of the same reasons we're seeing the benefit now. The primary reasons are around supply chain constraints around not having enough capacity to meet the demand and that happening in a number of different markets. So, there are obviously reasons for that to normalize. That will come through in the form of increased capacity from suppliers. It may come through in the form of decreased demand from the end markets. But we certainly think there is a permanent benefit in what we have experienced in the past couple of years as it pertains to our increasing value-add mix, the increased adoption in the industry as well as our ability to compete effectively in really successful markets around the country. There's $1 billion more left on that authorization. Yes. I mean I think the biggest impacts are from what commodities did and what the profitability did in the first half. We -- and you know this, Jay, we've been very consistent about it. We continue to build our models with that expectation of a regression towards a more normalized commodity price. And instead of progressing it actually accelerated for a window of time. So that benefit is certainly real to us. It generates real cash that we put to work. So that's a big piece of it. Our profitability is up, right? So that outperformance certainly we're very happy with, and we think that is going to continue to be a positive influence on the business as we continue to execute on productivity initiatives and things we're doing to drive that profitability, and that's another big piece. And then probably the least pleasant component is that $100 million of CapEx that we don't think we're going to be able to pull in this year just given the pace of supply chain issues. No, that's the guidance. So $2.75 billion, I may have taken some liberty and round it up to $3 billion. We'll continue to watch, obviously, the results as the year progresses and if there's more there, I propose we'll deliver it. It's about 1/4 between what the market moves at and what we would expect to flow through our COGS. On average, it's very open. It's a pretty wide bell curve, but yes, it's about 1/4. And I guess the answer to that is no. We have not seen any one cutting prices into this market with the exception of people who are following the commodity prices, right? I mean that is common. That happens all the time, good or bad. Yes. We're just running the same play. We always do, Steven. Really, this is normal of for us. Just like normal seasonality, we continue to align our purchases with the inbound flow of orders. We maintain appropriate inventory on hand levels usually on a days basis, but really down to a granular level by market, sometimes by location, depending on the SKUs under consideration. Certainly, it's something that we were careful about from the perspective you can never run out, right? If you run out, it better be the suppliers but it better not be on us. So that's a requirement. That's a commitment we make to our customers and something that we work very, very hard to ensure -- but we're going to -- we're still running the same play in a down market as an upmarket in terms of how we think about ensuring the right amount of supply on hand. When it comes to commodities, I would say probably not. I think based on what we're seeing in terms of performance of the business. If anything, it's more competitive, not less as things normalize, that's kind of our expectation don't see it eroding in a significant way. But yes, I mean, I think there's certainly an opportunity for increased competitiveness. If we're going to be competitive in any part of our business, it's absolutely the commodity space in terms of a gross margin normalizing more quickly than that. I think I have a couple of different answers to that question. When we're talking about margins, I think we've been very, very clear that is going to return to normal over time. I think the other part of that answer though is really around value add. Value-add is an important part of the mix. Our growth is substantially higher than the rest of the business. And while there's certainly a gross margin component to that, we believe that, that is very sticky like Dave was referring to earlier and that, that is going to be held on to in terms of an important resource by the homebuilding community, and we're going to continue to invest and to be that partner for them. So, we do think that's sticky in the long term. No. I think continued is a good way to characterize it. We feel good about July, and we're going to continue to be reactive and responsive, maybe better said to the market dynamics that we're faced with. But right now, we are hitting on all cylinders and focusing on our customers."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Priscilla. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our record first quarter results for 2022. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. The first quarter press release and our investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and our presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2021 was a phenomenal year for our company. We entered the first quarter of 2022 building on that strong momentum and delivered another quarter of record net sales, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. We produced strong core organic sales growth of 15%, marking our fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Along with our strong start to the year, we continue to invest prudently in our operations and work hard to deliver outstanding service to our customers in the face of significant supply chain constraints that persist throughout our industry. The success we've achieved is directly attributable to all 28,000 of our hard-working and dedicated team members who go above and beyond every day to help us maintain our position as the industry leader. I'll cover four key topics on today's call. First, I'll provide a quick update on our base business and our record first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our acquisition success that continues to strengthen our premier market position, including our most recent tuck-in deals. Next, I'll provide an update on our digital strategy. And finally, I'll discuss our view of the current state of the housing market. On Slide 3, I've highlighted this important point for several quarters and would like to share it again. As we discussed during our Investor Day last December, we believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology to better appreciate the underlying growth and profitability of our company by normalizing for commodity prices. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. Turning to Slide 4. Over the next 4 years, we expect our base business to deliver a 10% CAGR on the top line, a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR, and importantly, a 50 basis point per year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points of improvement by 2025. And our expected full year 2022 base business performance is ahead of these targets. As a result of this performance, we expect to have $7 billion to $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025. That includes this year's planned capital investments in innovation and organic growth, along with M&A and share repurchases. Turning to our first quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered strong core organic growth of 15%. Commodity price inflation added 13% and acquisitions added 8%. Our single family core organic growth was nearly 17%, once again exceeding the single-family starts growth, which was about 4%. And our single family core organic growth was double digits across all 3 of our operating divisions. Our multifamily and R&R segments each grew approximately 10%. Core organic sales in value-added products grew by 31% compared to the prior year period, and value-added products were the key growth driver across all customer segments, accounting for nearly 80% of our organic growth in the quarter. This is another strong data point that confirms our strategy is working. We delivered record sales of nearly $6 billion in the first quarter and generated $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6%. These exceptional results were driven by robust demand for housing, internal productivity and ongoing pricing discipline in a volatile, supply-constrained environment. Let's turn to M&A. We remain focused on executing tuck-in M&A that delivers a high return. As you can see on Slide 6, there are more than 1,000 potential opportunities with revenue less than $100 million clearly highlighting our future opportunity for growth. On Slide 7, last year, we completed 7 acquisitions for $1.2 billion. This year, we expect to invest approximately $500 million in accretive M&A, and we're off to a great start. On April 1, we acquired Panel Truss, a multi-location provider of building components to single and multifamily markets with 7 locations throughout Texas, Georgia and South Carolina. The additional component capacity expands our value-added solutions offerings in several key high-growth markets. Panel Truss had approximately $138 million in sales last year. Also on April 1, we acquired Valley Truss, a single-location provider of building components to single and multifamily markets in Boise, Idaho. Boise's active housing market is seeing an influx of national homebuilders rushing in to meet a rise in local demand, and we're excited to partner with builders to meet their ambitious goals. Valley Truss sales were approximately $26 million in 2021. I want to welcome the team members from Panel Truss and Valley Truss to the BFS family, and I look forward to providing future updates on how Builders FirstSource will continue to lead the way in consolidating our fragmented industry. Next, I'll provide a brief update on our digital strategy on Slide 8 as we continue to accelerate our pace of digital transformation. During our fourth quarter earnings call, I highlighted the deployment of Paradigm Estimate, which we continue to roll out across our operations to provide faster and more accurate customer quotes. Year-to-date, we have completed 2,000 estimates on customer plans across 9 states, and that adoption will continue to accelerate. In addition, this process provides a foundation for our configurable visualization technology and improved design and construction efficiency for homebuilders. Regarding our visualization technology, I'm pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with Hayden Homes, a builder in the Pacific Northwest for the use of our Homebuilder Omni platform. With their plans of approximately 2,000 starts, Hayden Homes will become the largest builder currently using our digital solutions. We believe we are making the necessary investments to revolutionize our industry and that our digital strategy is on track to capture an incremental $1 billion growth opportunity by 2026. Turning to productivity. We expect to deliver over $100 million in productivity savings in 2022 by continuing to leverage our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System, which we've highlighted at our Investor Day in December. We're off to a strong start. As an example, our component manufacturing and efficiency metrics shows that our board feet produced per hour has improved by 19% versus the first quarter of last year as our teams work aggressively to maximize the throughput of our existing facilities to meet demand. Over the long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement as our teams work together to leverage best practices and technology, allowing us to become more efficient and productive in serving our customers. Lately, many industry headlines expressed uncertainty and concern. From what we have seen across the thousands of customers and homesites that we serve, I can affirm that this industry remains strong, underbuilt and resilient. I believe the homebuilding industry will continue to grow this year and that we will outperform our peers as our platform delivers for our customers and our shareholders. Despite persistent supply chain challenges and rising interest rates, we are not expecting a significant downturn in housing because we are far healthier and more prepared industry than the last time we saw a significant downturn. Our beliefs are supported by 3 key facts: first, the significant underbuilding of homes that has occurred over the last 12-plus years; next, the improvement in underlying demographic demand; and finally, the credit quality of that demand. We continue to believe that the U.S. housing market is significantly underbuilt. And while I acknowledge higher mortgage rates will likely represent a near-term headwind to satisfying that demand, we continue to see tremendous momentum and long-term growth for the industry. In the first quarter, single-family homes under construction increased 27.5% versus the prior year to 789,000 units. As a result of this underlying demand and ongoing supply chain challenges, total units under construction hit 1.6 million in March. The last time this occurred was in the summer of 1973. Also, the cancellation rates have remained low at approximately 8% during the first quarter, essentially unchanged from last year, indicating customer demand remains durable. Turning to demographic growth. We see a clear favorable trend in the most populous age cohort of 25- to 34-year olds. This swell of young adults is moving into their early 30s, a time of life when many people start to buy their first homes or move from apartments to single-family homes, and we are seeing household formations reflect this demographic shift. And last month, according to the U.S. Census, the home vacancy survey revealed that all mature age cohorts younger than 50 years old posted year-over-year increases in homeownership, the first time this has occurred since 1994. This data indicates the overall financial strength and creditworthiness of today's buyers are far healthier and more resilient than in the last cycle as evidenced by the strong consumer balance sheets resulting from the trillions of dollars in COVID relief measures and the low 3.6% unemployment rate. So the homebuilding industry remains well positioned with significant tailwinds given the historic underbuilding, favorable demographics and consumers with strong finances. As a company, we have a long track record of successful execution, gaining share and driving efficiencies through innovation for our customers. We significantly overachieved our BMC synergy commitments and are ramping up productivity and operational excellence across the entire organization. We will continue to focus our efforts on accelerating our growth in higher-margin value-added products and investing further in our digital solutions platform to advance our goal of transforming the homebuilding industry. For 2022, we have increased our outlook and expect strong double-digit base business growth and significant free cash flow generation. We remain committed to deploying capital into high-return internal investments, accretive bolt-on M&A and share repurchases. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting Military Appreciation Month and its importance to Builders FirstSource. At BFS, we are honored to be a military-friendly employer and to be part of the journey for those who have served our country. One veteran we are particularly proud of is Rodney Hatch, who served as a marine and is now a safety coordinator for multiple locations across our Alabama and Mississippi geographies. Rodney honors and celebrates those who have greatly served our country by creating veteran walls at our locations showcasing those who are now growing their careers with BFS. His spirit of community doesn't stop with his coworkers.  Rodney gives back to local neighborhoods by maintaining blessing boxes and honor system food pantry where people in need can take food and necessities. And when Hurricane Ida hit the area last year, Rodney jumped into action, collecting donations from his fellow team members and delivering them to Louisiana himself. He does all of this on top of this vital role of keeping our people safe, a responsibility he excels at, day in and day out. His safety-first mindset and teachings have helped his 6 locations achieve 0 recordable injuries so far in 2022. People like Rodney are the reason we continue to see year-over-year reductions in our recordable incidents as part of our never-ending drive to 0. We are fortunate to have Rodney on our team, and I thank him for his service for our country and the communities we serve. And I'm grateful to all of our veterans and each of our 28,000-plus team members who embody our core values, putting people first and showing our customers why BFS is the most valuable partner in our industry. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q1 results and provide an update on our improved 2022 financial guidance.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to take a moment and thank each one of our team members who delivered an incredible first quarter of 2022. We are very pleased with our remarkable first quarter results. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment through 2022 and beyond as we leverage our strong cash flow to make accretive investments in our operations and add great businesses to the BFS family, all while executing against our share repurchase authorizations. I will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our Q1 results. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment efforts. And finally, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full year 2022. Let's begin with our Q1 performance on Slide 10. We had net sales of $5.7 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 36% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products grew by an estimated 30.8%, underlining our work to meet the strong demand across our value-added channels and the continued supply chain constraints. Our focus on value-added products continues to strengthen our appeal to customers looking to improve efficiency on the job site. Gross profit was $1.8 billion, a 71% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The gross margin percentage increased 670 basis points to 32.3%, primarily driven by disciplined pricing in a volatile, supply-constrained marketplace as well as effective and timely sourced. SG&A was $968.6 million, an increase of $147 million or 17.9% compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by acquisitions and variable compensation. Variable and incentive compensation increased due to core organic growth and improved profitability. We also made strategic investments in IT, productivity and digital initiatives. Lastly, fuel-related expenses increased by $12 million or nearly 50% due to recent global events. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 270 basis points to 17%. Adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 120% to $1 billion driven by strong demand across our key customer end markets, higher commodity prices and improved gross margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 17.6%, increasing 670 basis points compared to the prior year period as we continue to manage spending in a fast-growing environment. Net income in the quarter was $639.6 million or $3.56 per share compared to net income of $172.6 million or $0.83 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $700.8 million or $3.90 of adjusted EPS compared to the net income of $296.3 million or $1.42 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. The 136.5% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income taxes and SG&A expenses. Now let's turn to cash flow. Our first quarter cash provided by operating activities was $179.8 million, and cash used in investing activities was $48.3 million. We generated free cash flow of $131.5 million. I'll highlight the fact that we are cash flow-positive in Q1 for the first time. Historically, in the first half of the year, we are a net borrower as we make seasonal increases in working capital. This quarter's positive cash flow really highlights the strength of our market-leading platform. Let's turn to capital deployment. This year, we have spent approximately $180 million on our M&A transactions which closed in April. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for roughly $286 million at an average stock price of $79.58. In addition, we repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares in April 2022 for $266.9 million at an average stock price of $62.21. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $552.9 million of stock. The number of shares repurchased was lower than the past 2 quarters primarily due to the timing of M&A and seasonal working capital needs. Since August 2021, we have repurchased approximately 35.3 million shares of stock at an average price of $65.10 for $2.3 billion. This represents almost 17% of our total shares outstanding in less than a year. I'm happy to announce that yesterday, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of $2 billion. When added to the $2.3 billion already repurchased, our authorization provides for $4.3 billion of total share repurchases. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing our stock and continuing to create value for our shareholders. Also on Slide 11, our pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.9x our actual EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2027. Our total liquidity was $1.2 billion, consisting of approximately $900 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $282 million of cash on hand. We are off to a great start this year. The team is driving higher-margin products, delivering value and efficiency to our customers, and our balance sheet remains rock solid. Let's shift gears and discuss updated '22 full year outlook on Slide 12. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. We are maintaining our estimate of single-family starts growth across our geographies in the mid-single digits and R&R and multifamily growth in the low to mid-single digits. As we discussed last quarter, we are providing you with our base business guide on net sales and EBITDA as we believe this is a better measurement of our performance and assumes constant commodity costs at $400 per thousand board foot. We will continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart in our investor presentation to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. As a result of our Q1 performance, we are increasing our 2022 base business sales growth guidance from 8% to 12% to 10% to 14% or $17.6 billion at the midpoint. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA growth guidance from 12% to 18% to 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the midpoint. Our CapEx forecast came down $20 million due to supply chain delays and is expected to be approximately $390 million in 2022. This year's CapEx will be focused on adding capacities to existing and establishing new value-added facilities to support growth initiatives that will create capacity for higher-margin products. We delivered $55 million in cost synergies to the P&L in the first quarter, fully recognizing the synergy commitments of the BMC merger. In addition, we expect to deliver over $100 million in productivity savings this year as we continue to drive improvements across our operations. We expect to generate free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.4 billion in 2022, reflecting higher commodity prices, disciplined working capital management and our ability to capitalize on our industry-leading product portfolio. This is an increase of $400 million from last quarter's free cash flow guide. Our projected free cash flow assumes average commodity prices in the range of $700 to $1,000 for the full year. We still anticipate working capital coming down due to lower commodity prices in the back half of 2022. On Slide 13, we provide the sensitivity chart I mentioned, providing an illustrative way to think about our total sales and total adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 at various static commodity price points. We believe 2022 will be another strong year of growth. We continue to focus on growing value-added products, driving operational excellence across the company and delivering innovative technology to our customers. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry remains resilient and underbuilt, and we believe it will continue to grow in 2022 and beyond. Our momentum is strong. Our industry-leading platform is generating exceptional results, which we expect to continue in the second quarter, the remainder of this year and beyond. Our balanced capital application strategy is delivering significant value to our shareholders. We're committed to organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and continuing to execute share repurchases to generate accretive returns. I remain optimistic on the prospects for our industry, and I'm highly confident in our company's ability to outperform the market over the long term. Priscilla, let's please open the call now for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question today from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Dahl: Nice set of results here. So I have a couple of questions on kind of the core and some of the margin trends. So it looks like you converted the core still in kind of the mid-30s or low to mid-30s incremental EBITDA and maybe a mid-teens organic or core organic margin. You're guiding to about 12.2% core for the year in terms of the margin. So understanding 15% is pretty exceptional or mid-teens is exceptional, talk us through the balance of the year and what some of the puts and takes are that bring you down to that full year margin number.\nPeter Jackson: Mike, yes, it's a good question. There's certainly been a lot going on this year, as you know, the volatility in the markets, the supply chain issues, the ups and downs in commodity pricing. What we've been looking at is an exceptionally strong first half of the year. We knew it would be strong. I'm not sure we knew it would be this strong in terms of the dynamics. What we're anticipating is that the back half of this year, we'll see some normalization, that we'll see a directional trend in commodity prices back towards our long-term estimate around the base business, $400. Probably won't get there by year-end, but it will head that way. We also anticipate seeing increasing relief in the supply chain space. The interruptions we've seen historically due to the -- basically, the illness and the manufacturing facilities around some of the components we need to build homes, that's been improving pretty steadily over the course of the year. And as more capacity either comes on board or the supply chain stabilizes, we think that will normalize things a little bit in the back half as well. But pretty modestly, we think for the full year, the underlying market is still strong, margins will remain strong, but it will start to drift back towards a more normal level as the year progresses.\nMichael Dahl: Okay. That helps. And I guess my second question, it's somewhat related. If I look at your bridge on sensitivities around different commodity price assumptions, both your sales and adjusted EBITDA ranges went up a decent amount compared to your prior sensitivities. So how much of that should we think of as being kind of true sustainable improvement in the base versus some of these -- just the first half being so exceptional like you're talking about and some things that may be still more transitory?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. No -- but again, that's a good point that's -- that page is really focused around trying to layer on the impact of commodities over top of the core base business, right? So we did call up the base our -- both sales and EBITDA beat pretty handily. I think we beat by about 5% in terms of what we're guiding for the full year. That was really based on Q1 performance. So really, that's a really nice run rate in terms of what we've seen so far. That's the biggest kind of underlying factor on Slide 13 with the sensitivities. The only thing I'll highlight on that slide, just as a reminder, this is a -- it's a bit of a blunt instrument. We think it's handy. We think it's helpful. But just please remember this is a static commodity price snap the line. So volatility in commodity prices will move these numbers around.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: Dave, could you give that stat again where you talked about the amount of homes under construction?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. We said total 1.6 million.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Really a remarkable number, looking back through history.\nDavid Flitman: It's been a long time since we've been at this level.\nJay McCanless: Yes. Absolutely. And I guess, the kind of the follow-up to what Mike Dahl was asking you if you have that many homes under construction along with what I think is a pretty heavy permit backlog at the builders, why -- I guess, why do you think maybe demand and/or activity slows down a little bit? It seems with the builders cancellation rates staying low that it's hard for me to envision a scenario where unit volumes really take a step back from what we're seeing now.\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think you're thinking about it right, Jay. We're actually not expecting volumes to significantly decline this year. As Peter mentioned, there's some comparison issues in the back half of the year. We may get -- we're hoping for a little bit of supply chain relief as the year progresses, but we're very confident in not only what we're seeing early in the second quarter. But to your point, given the backlog that's out there and conversations with our customers, the environment is going to remain robust here for the rest of the year.\nJay McCanless: Great. And then in terms of Hayden Homes, that's a pretty big announcement. Pretty encouraging to see that they're taking on the full platform. I mean, what -- I guess, maybe what is kind of your thinking on the growth trajectory there? You tested at Hayden for a year and then maybe move to a bigger builder? Or how should we think about that? And getting to that full $1 billion in omnichannel revenue that you talked about at the Investor Day, how does that progress?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. Thanks for asking that one. We're excited about Hayden, and we're certainly excited about the work that we've got going on with our digital platform, and this is just great recognition of the work and the traction that we're getting in the market. Hayden is the largest customer so far that we've worked with on digital. They are the sixth customer that we have for Omni for homebuilders, but by far the largest at this point. And it's a really cool story actually. Legacy Paradigm had been working with them a year to 18 months ago, and they kind of lost a little bit of traction until our acquisition of Paradigm last summer. And Hayden really realized that the ability to build out this platform and -- with the financial wherewithal that we have and the investment we were committed to making in advancing digital is really what brought them back to the table and allowed us to sign this agreement with them. They also were a legacy BFS customer already in Idaho. So we've got a longstanding relationship with them. And so it was good to see that materialize into the signing of that agreement for Omni. So we're excited about it. To your second part of your question, we do expect things to ramp up. But as you recall, and we've said this the last couple of quarters and certainly in our Investor Day, this is a year where we're investing heavily in that platform to build out our capabilities for digital, in Omni and all the other pieces of the digital platform. And so as we would expect, we will see continued customer adoption of this through the course of this year and into next year. But that $1 billion of revenue is really back-end loaded, in the back half of that period of time and we said that from the beginning, only because of the digital ramp-up that we see coming over the next 3 or 4 years. So a lot of heavy lifting going on by the team. They're doing a great job, and we're excited.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Wanted to ask a first one on the base business revenue guide, some of the components of that. Seeing sort of base business sales guidance of 10% to 14% for the year. I think you said 5% to 6% from the smaller acquisitions and then, obviously, you've got the low to mid-single-digit growth in the end markets. And doing the math, that implies sort of minimal noncommodity inflation and other market share gains. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly and sort of how you guys are thinking about all the pieces there.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Thanks, Matt. The numbers do include the components you described. We certainly have had good success in organic growth on top of our M&A work. As you described, there are certainly some inflationary factors in the market. Our guide for this year tends to account for them in a balanced way and kind of forecast that out. But as I mentioned, if we do see relief from the supply chain, some of that inflationary influence will start to dissipate. Timing is a great question, and we've tried to incorporate that the back half in a reasonable way as our trend is down sort of analytics, but -- that's really what we're trying to account for in this forecast for the remainder of the year.\nMatthew Bouley: Understood. Okay. Got that. And then secondly, the manufactured products and windows, doors, millwork, strength. I don't know, kind of a higher-level question to the extent you can see this. Are you finding that this is just continuing to be driven by better adoption by builders? Or are you seeing signs -- and maybe it's a combination of both, but are you seeing signs that builders are actually attempting to simplify their product given all the challenges they're going through with supply chain? And so that, in and of itself, is supporting kind of just increased usage of manufactured products across the board? I don't know, maybe it's an unfair question, but to the extent you can see, I'd be curious your thoughts there.\nDavid Flitman: Yes. It's a totally unfair question, but we'll answer it anyway, Matt. And I think you hit the nail on the head there. It's really a combination of both. And as we've talked for a long time, both legacy companies and this combination are really stepping on the gas relative to the value-add components in millwork. And we've seen great adoption. But also last year, given the supply chain constraints, we did see builders become a little bit more agnostic on the products that they have taken. And also what you're seeing in our windows, millwork and doors, this quarter in particular, things were really tough a year ago relative to supply. I would say it's incrementally better now, particularly on interior doors. Window lead times have come down a bit, but there's still quite a backlog. And in fact, some of these products that we're talking about here have actually inhibited the timely closing of homes, as we've talked about over the course of the last year. So I think it's a combination of both of those. But listen, I couldn't be more excited about the momentum that we have around our strategy inside the company, the way our team members have embraced it and also the way our customers are ramping up because we are saving them time, money. And labor availability will remain tight, and we think these products are very sticky. We've seen that through the course of time. And we think there's still a long runway of adoption ahead of us.\nOperator: We will move next to Keith Hughes with Truist Securities.\nKeith Hughes: Kind of building on the last question. Your growth in manufactured products is -- it's been absolutely outstanding. As you talk to others in the industry and look -- and acquisitions that are coming in, are they seeing the same kind of growth levels above the market that you're seeing? Or is this something you need for Builders FirstSource?\nDavid Flitman: Well, I really can't speak to what our competitors are doing there, Keith, but I can tell you that the phenomenon that we're seeing relative to adoption is not unique to us. It is certainly unique from how hard we're hitting it from our strategy and the way we're investing. I think we have a leg up on our competitors with the capital that we can deploy, preferentially to value added. And we are certainly doing that as we are spending a disproportionate amount of our capital on these assets for both organic growth and as you've seen over the course of time here, the acquisitions that we're doing. And we will continue to do that through the course of time.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. We're really meeting a need there. The amount of stress builders are under to get homes completed, it's hard on them, right, with all of the supply chain disruption. So this is an area, by leveraging what we do best, that they can make their lives easier, they can be more efficient, they can be more effective. So it's certainly been really good momentum, and we think our positioning strategically, as Dave was saying, is powerful.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. And just one follow-up. Your last two acquisitions, the Truss acquisitions. As you look at doing acquisitions in the future is -- that's where a lot of the dollar is going to get just because there's a lot of those available out there? Are there other areas you think you would send the acquisition dollars again to grow the manufactured product base?\nDavid Flitman: Yes. I think you'll see us, again, continue to invest heavily in value add. There are a number of potential targets still out there. Love our footprint, love what we're doing across the country, but we will take opportunities to strengthen the value-added side of the business differentially through M&A through the course of time.\nOperator: And we will go now to Reuben Garner with The Benchmark.\nReuben Garner: Congrats on the strong quarter and outlook. So maybe the gross margin line, I don't think I've heard any updates to the long-term outlook there, Peter. But maybe it would help if you could kind of -- I think, historically, I would think about rising commodity periods like we just had in the first part of the year as a detractor to gross margin, and yet you guys still posted well over 30% gross margin, which is way above, I think, your normalized range. Can you kind of walk through the components there and why you think it's so elevated now versus where things will normalize when, I guess, the supply chain loosens up?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. No, that's a good question. And it really does boil down to the dynamics, whether it's attributable directly to COVID or supply chain interruptions, post-COVID, combined with that demand that we're referring to in some of our scripted commentary. The push, the amount of interest from homebuyers and the resulting drive by homebuilders to meet that demand has really put pressure on an industry that over the years has just shrunken down its capacity post kind of the go-go years of the early 2000s. So getting to that limit of available capacity is, I think, in a lot of ways, just pushed us up the bell curve. It is what it is. We're responding to it and managing it very, very well, I think. Staying disciplined, disciplined in the way that we purchase, the way that we partner with vendors and with customers to keep the supply chain moving the best we can. But that has certainly created opportunities along the way to manage profits and to push through the product that we know we can get. I do think over time, though, that supply chain, that difficulty will start to release a little bit, right? It'll alleviate. And as more product becomes available to more folks broadly in the market, we do think there will be a normalization. So you're right, we have not updated our normal gross margin guide. It's still 27% or higher in the long term. We still think we're on track for our LRP goals, but there'll be some ups and downs along the way in our estimation.\nReuben Garner: Got it. And then correct me-- this could be wrong from the start, but I think I saw the CapEx guide came in lower than you previously were looking at. Any color there, just like an inability to get projects done? Or is it reducing the spend because of the environment? Any color there would be helpful.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. No. Unfortunately, it's really just supply chain. We've got orders out for rolling stock and equipment and buildings and all these things we're trying to do. And unfortunately, it's just slower moving than we would have hoped. There was an article in The Journal yesterday, I think, about just how hard it is to get heavy-duty trucks. Lead times are long, and the chip and supply chain shortages in that industry have really made it harder on us. We're spending more on R&M, just trying to keep up with the units we have versus getting the new ones we would rather have.\nReuben Garner: All right. Great. Congrats again, guys.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Reuben.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Your outlook for $7 billion to $10 billion of free cash flow between now and 2025, could you remind me what single-family housing start assumption was baked into that? Was it kind of a low single-digit number?\nPeter Jackson: It was. Yes.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. Okay. And then does it matter how we get there? If the average is the same, does it matter if it's a consistent growth rate or a U-shape or an S-shape or something? Does it matter over that time frame if it's consistent versus more volatile?\nPeter Jackson: No. It really doesn't. It's an endpoint target in 2025. So to your point, the path to get there I don't think is important. It certainly is informative as we go through this process that it's a base business guide, right? So all these changes you see in commodities and cash flows along the way, at least so far, have been incremental. But you're right, there's plenty of opportunity for us to move through unusual markets along the way to that ultimate target.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. Okay. And then could you potentially bridge SG&A for us versus last year? I'm just trying to kind of parse out how much is acquisition versus the core, meaning compensation, occupancy, transportation, that's sort of thing.\nPeter Jackson: We certainly can. I'm not sure I can do it off the top of my head. We can cover it and give you sort of the bigger pieces when we talk or we can get back to you in an e-mail, if that's helpful.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. That sounds good.\nOperator: And we will go next to Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.\nRyan Gilbert: Could you offer any commentary around end-market core organic growth trends just so far quarter-to-date in 2Q?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So there's -- I mean, I'll say this the right way. We have certainly continued to see strength across the end markets. There are certainly regional strengths that we notice. I would say the central and south part of the country certainly doing the strongest, but all of the markets are up geographically. Some mix between products, some mix between what we're seeing in sort of the single-family core, which I think has kept really good momentum versus the R&R, which we think we -- I think we've seen some ebbs and flows. Whenever you see significant increases in commodity prices, for example, that can sometimes put a headwind on the total demand. But on average, in total, everything -- each one of the pieces and in total, everything is green and positive year-to-date so far. Good momentum.\nDavid Flitman: And as I said, Ryan, all 3 of our operating divisions, West, Central and East, had double-digit core organic growth in the quarter. So to Peter's point, very consistent. Some ebbs and flows in certain geographies, but very strong overall.\nRyan Gilbert: Okay. Great. And I guess, considering the increased adoption in value-added manufactured products, are you seeing any changes in builder interest levels in looking at more vertically integrated off-site solutions?\nPeter Jackson: Well, I certainly think they would take it if we could build it fast enough. The challenge today is really just getting the capacity on the ground and available to them to shorten the existing lead times. But it's -- what I think is important to highlight here is that it's really opened the eyes, I think, of more builders than ever to the advantages to what offsite fabricated components can do for builders who want to professionalize and be really good at their art and craft of homebuilding.\nOperator: And we will move now to Adam Baumgarten from Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten: Nice quarter. I guess to start, just could you give us a sense for how much price inflation contributed to the core organic sales growth of 15% in the quarter?\nPeter Jackson: It's an important part of it. No question. We haven't broken out the PBM. We might at some point in the future, but it was meaningful.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. And then just given the free cash flow outlook and the incremental $2 billion authorization, is there any reason to believe that share repurchases in '22 won't be at or above '21 levels?\nPeter Jackson: Well, we certainly won't give a specific guidance like that, but I will say that our strategy is consistent. We're not going off script on this. We're going to prioritize investing in the company, making sure our debt is in the right position, making sure our investment in organic internal growth is right. We've committed to continuing to do smart, accretive tuck-in acquisitions. We're going to continue to do that, as you've seen. But we're generating a lot of cash. And we think our stock is undervalued, and we've highlighted that as a pathway that we think is a smart thing to do for investing.\nOperator: And we will go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nNoah Merkousko: This is Noah Merkousko on for Trey. Congrats on the strong results.\nDavid Flitman: Thanks, Noah.\nNoah Merkousko: So first question, it sounded like you're anticipating some supply chain normalization here in the back half of the year. Do you think you'll start to see gross margins get closer or even be at that 27%, maybe as we exit the year?\nPeter Jackson: I do think there'll be some normalization. I don't think we're going to get all the way back. There are certain products that will remain elevated for some time. Just barring a significant change that we don't really see coming, that would indicate that the other products would bring it down somewhat. But I would say at this point, no, we don't think that 27% by year-end is right, but a trend in that direction is reasonable to expect.\nNoah Merkousko: All right. That makes sense. And then on my follow-up, I was hoping you could kind of frame the magnitude of the capacity expansion that you're doing in value add. And if we continue to see this kind of growth, do you think you'll run into any capacity constraints before you can get that new capacity online as we look out for the balance of this year?\nPeter Jackson: Well, we certainly have capacity constraints now. Our lead times are longer than we would like them to be. We look at ways to improve our ability to deliver to customers all over the country. They talked about our board feet per man-hour productivity metric, where we're trying to get the -- more production out of the same. We've talked in the past about adding shifts. We continue to do that. We continue to add lines, and we continue to add plans. So we're double-digit equivalent plans in any given year in terms of everything we're doing. But then that is -- that comes with its own challenges in terms of available components to put into that, the people we need to do that. But it's certainly a focus on meeting that demand because it's impressive right now, and it's something that obviously we do very well.\nDavid Flitman: And it is a disproportionate amount of the capital we're spending in total for the company into those value-added products.\nOperator: We'll take our next question today from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.\nKurt Yinger: Here in Q1, there's been a lot of grumbling on the distribution side just around material availability and comments around -- kind of along the lines of we have more, we could sell it, and perhaps that's the case for you as well. But I think the growth pretty clearly highlights that you're getting more than your fair share of that vendor supply. And I was hoping you could just talk about what you think is driving that and what it says about the BFS platform.\nDavid Flitman: Yes. Very good question. And we've commented on this in the past. I think the strength of our platform since the merger is enabling exactly what you highlighted there, which is we believe we're getting a disproportionate amount of share from our suppliers. These are long-standing relationships. And importantly, they're symbiotic relationships. We're equally important to our suppliers as they are to us, and we've got really good momentum in those relationships. To your point around supply, I think, incrementally, I would say, as I think I commented earlier, windows were slightly better than they were a year ago, interior doors, lumber is more readily available. But to your point, I would expect things like engineered wood products to be constrained in supplied for a long time to come. Exterior doors are still tight. Siding and trim are difficult. Some of that -- some of those products are even still on allocation. So it really is a mixed bag. And when we say we're incrementally better than we were a year ago, I mean exactly that. Some are better, some are no better. And there's some that are no better, unfortunately, we think, are going to be in tight supply for quite some time to come.\nKurt Yinger: Great. Okay. And then Peter, just a follow-up on the normalized gross margin and where you've been running over the last couple of quarters. Are there any product categories that really stick out in terms of significantly outperforming? Or has it been pretty broad-based?\nPeter Jackson: It's pretty broad-based. I would say the timing of different products and how they moved throughout the last 1.5 years have been varied. But I think it's fair to say that it's a pretty wide range, pretty broad brush increase in pricing that we've seen come through the channel.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Collin Verron with Jefferies.\nCollin Verron: Great quarter. I just wanted to turn to the productivity improvements. You talked about how you've hit your BMC synergy target, and you're pivoting to more productivity. Can you just talk about some of the larger examples you have? I know you mentioned the increased throughput. And then any color as to what that 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement translates into dollars on an annual basis and what that does to your long-term incremental EBITDA margin guide for the base business?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Thanks, Collin. So the productivity is an exciting part of the business. I think there's a lot of history in our company at finding ways to drive improvement. And we think we have a real opportunity at this stage at our scale to really share those best practices and leverage people, process and technology to continue the momentum that we've seen with the synergy savings from BMC. It's a variety of things. It's process. It's redesigning certain things that we work on, but it hits a lot of different areas, right? It's reporting, driving over time. It's changing the architecture of certain organizations. It's improving our ability to optimize our tax rate. It is -- they're all things that we think are going to drive the business over the next long range of time. Good businesses do it regularly, year in, year out. And we certainly think that we have the capability to do it. What we're looking to do is make it a more normal part of our cadence and less dependent on big acquisitions to be a catalyst for that. So we did build a number into our long-range plan. So we certainly have accounted for that SG&A improvement in the numbers. I can be candid and tell you it's not equal to the 3% to 5% target we're going to set for ourselves. We're going to be more aggressive with what we push for. And we're going to commit to our long-range plan having a number lower than that, but success, nonetheless. So we certainly feel good about it, and we feel good about our track record and being able to continue to drive those types of improvements in a variety of areas.\nCollin Verron: That's helpful color. And then I guess just turning to the macro environment quickly. I know there's a lot of debate out there about housing and concerns around what happens to BLDR's margins if new resi volumes start to decline. So I was just hoping you can give us a little bit of color as to what leverage you can pull to adjust to that kind of declining volume environment to protect your margin. And just help us think about how resilient your EBITDA margins would be if we do start to see any volume declines.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I mean that's a good question. While we're not at all concerned with what we think the market is doing or where it will go, we're also not blind to the idea that this is a cyclical business at times and mortgage rates are going up. So we're going to fall back on the playbook and the leadership that we're so lucky to have. We have a lot of experienced leaders that have been through these types of situations before. And when we look at our ability to perform, we're certainly very, very pleased with our starting point. To be more specific, we are clearly a better scale, a more efficient and leaner organization. We have better analytics and a better ability to monitor our performance than at any point in our history. We've taken out what is over $500 million in costs as a result of the combined mergers over the last 5 to 10 years. Those are really important things to consider when you look at what our business will perform -- how our business will perform in the face of a headwind environment. More specifically, we have some really obvious actions, right? We manage variable expenses every day. And as the volumes of our business shift, we're going to stay very focused on making sure we're sized accordingly. At our scale, we have a lot of pathways available to us. We also talked about operational excellence and productivity. Those are important characteristics that we will leverage into any sort of headwind environment.  And the other factor to think about is that when we are investing in our company, the biggest investment we make in any given year is really about working capital. And that working capital that we fund as we grow this business comes back to us in those moments when the business sees downturn. We've seen it in past years. We've done a good job at it, and we know we can do it in any environment. That's certainly something that I think is important for investors to keep in mind, just how much cash we spin off in any sort of downside environment. There are more on the list of things we can do, but we're certainly prepared for any sort of downturn. At the same time, we're confident that the market is strong and our momentum is very, very good in this market today.\nOperator: And we will take our final question today from Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.\nAlexander Rygiel: Nice quarter. Can you expand upon how BFS is going to get paid for Omni and digital platforms? And then how should we think about the profitability of this business in comparison to the legacy BFS business?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So the nature of our committed improvement in performance and financial performance when we did the Paradigm announcement, and subsequent to that, we feel good about confirming our estimates. That $1 billion of increased sales by year 5 is primarily driven by increased pull-through of what BFS sells. So if you think about what we're offering into the marketplace, it's improved capabilities for homebuilders and homebuyers to make the build process more efficient, right? It's taking plans. Having configurable visualizations is a powerful tool, especially when you link it to structural design. And that capability is unique and it's powerful in terms of what it allows us to do for our customers. It allows us to offer more options. It allows us to offer more value add. It makes us more efficient in our ability to give good quotes and be better partners for our customers. And it's just easier to place an order, easier to work with us when you're leveraging those technologies that Paradigm has developed. So that's where we believe we're going to make our money. It's incremental sales in those core business markets in value add. There'll be more. We'll certainly see licensing revenue. We think there are other revenue streams through the Paradigm platform. But initially, that's the biggest impact in terms of what we've committed to do.\nOperator: And this does conclude our Q&A for today. I'll turn the call back to Michael Neese for any additional or closing remarks.\nMichael Neese: Thanks, Priscilla, and thank you for your time today and for your interest in Builders FirstSource. Have a great day. We will be in New York City tomorrow for the BTIG conference, and we hope to see you there. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "David Flitman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2021 was a phenomenal year for our company. We entered the first quarter of 2022 building on that strong momentum and delivered another quarter of record net sales, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. We produced strong core organic sales growth of 15%, marking our fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Along with our strong start to the year, we continue to invest prudently in our operations and work hard to deliver outstanding service to our customers in the face of significant supply chain constraints that persist throughout our industry. The success we've achieved is directly attributable to all 28,000 of our hard-working and dedicated team members who go above and beyond every day to help us maintain our position as the industry leader. I'll cover four key topics on today's call. First, I'll provide a quick update on our base business and our record first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our acquisition success that continues to strengthen our premier market position, including our most recent tuck-in deals. Next, I'll provide an update on our digital strategy. And finally, I'll discuss our view of the current state of the housing market. On Slide 3, I've highlighted this important point for several quarters and would like to share it again. As we discussed during our Investor Day last December, we believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology to better appreciate the underlying growth and profitability of our company by normalizing for commodity prices. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. Turning to Slide 4. Over the next 4 years, we expect our base business to deliver a 10% CAGR on the top line, a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR, and importantly, a 50 basis point per year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points of improvement by 2025. And our expected full year 2022 base business performance is ahead of these targets. As a result of this performance, we expect to have $7 billion to $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025. That includes this year's planned capital investments in innovation and organic growth, along with M&A and share repurchases. Turning to our first quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered strong core organic growth of 15%. Commodity price inflation added 13% and acquisitions added 8%. Our single family core organic growth was nearly 17%, once again exceeding the single-family starts growth, which was about 4%. And our single family core organic growth was double digits across all 3 of our operating divisions. Our multifamily and R&R segments each grew approximately 10%. Core organic sales in value-added products grew by 31% compared to the prior year period, and value-added products were the key growth driver across all customer segments, accounting for nearly 80% of our organic growth in the quarter. This is another strong data point that confirms our strategy is working. We delivered record sales of nearly $6 billion in the first quarter and generated $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6%. These exceptional results were driven by robust demand for housing, internal productivity and ongoing pricing discipline in a volatile, supply-constrained environment. Let's turn to M&A. We remain focused on executing tuck-in M&A that delivers a high return. As you can see on Slide 6, there are more than 1,000 potential opportunities with revenue less than $100 million clearly highlighting our future opportunity for growth. On Slide 7, last year, we completed 7 acquisitions for $1.2 billion. This year, we expect to invest approximately $500 million in accretive M&A, and we're off to a great start. On April 1, we acquired Panel Truss, a multi-location provider of building components to single and multifamily markets with 7 locations throughout Texas, Georgia and South Carolina. The additional component capacity expands our value-added solutions offerings in several key high-growth markets. Panel Truss had approximately $138 million in sales last year. Also on April 1, we acquired Valley Truss, a single-location provider of building components to single and multifamily markets in Boise, Idaho. Boise's active housing market is seeing an influx of national homebuilders rushing in to meet a rise in local demand, and we're excited to partner with builders to meet their ambitious goals. Valley Truss sales were approximately $26 million in 2021. I want to welcome the team members from Panel Truss and Valley Truss to the BFS family, and I look forward to providing future updates on how Builders FirstSource will continue to lead the way in consolidating our fragmented industry. Next, I'll provide a brief update on our digital strategy on Slide 8 as we continue to accelerate our pace of digital transformation. During our fourth quarter earnings call, I highlighted the deployment of Paradigm Estimate, which we continue to roll out across our operations to provide faster and more accurate customer quotes. Year-to-date, we have completed 2,000 estimates on customer plans across 9 states, and that adoption will continue to accelerate. In addition, this process provides a foundation for our configurable visualization technology and improved design and construction efficiency for homebuilders. Regarding our visualization technology, I'm pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with Hayden Homes, a builder in the Pacific Northwest for the use of our Homebuilder Omni platform. With their plans of approximately 2,000 starts, Hayden Homes will become the largest builder currently using our digital solutions. We believe we are making the necessary investments to revolutionize our industry and that our digital strategy is on track to capture an incremental $1 billion growth opportunity by 2026. Turning to productivity. We expect to deliver over $100 million in productivity savings in 2022 by continuing to leverage our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System, which we've highlighted at our Investor Day in December. We're off to a strong start. As an example, our component manufacturing and efficiency metrics shows that our board feet produced per hour has improved by 19% versus the first quarter of last year as our teams work aggressively to maximize the throughput of our existing facilities to meet demand. Over the long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement as our teams work together to leverage best practices and technology, allowing us to become more efficient and productive in serving our customers. Lately, many industry headlines expressed uncertainty and concern. From what we have seen across the thousands of customers and homesites that we serve, I can affirm that this industry remains strong, underbuilt and resilient. I believe the homebuilding industry will continue to grow this year and that we will outperform our peers as our platform delivers for our customers and our shareholders. Despite persistent supply chain challenges and rising interest rates, we are not expecting a significant downturn in housing because we are far healthier and more prepared industry than the last time we saw a significant downturn. Our beliefs are supported by 3 key facts: first, the significant underbuilding of homes that has occurred over the last 12-plus years; next, the improvement in underlying demographic demand; and finally, the credit quality of that demand. We continue to believe that the U.S. housing market is significantly underbuilt. And while I acknowledge higher mortgage rates will likely represent a near-term headwind to satisfying that demand, we continue to see tremendous momentum and long-term growth for the industry. In the first quarter, single-family homes under construction increased 27.5% versus the prior year to 789,000 units. As a result of this underlying demand and ongoing supply chain challenges, total units under construction hit 1.6 million in March. The last time this occurred was in the summer of 1973. Also, the cancellation rates have remained low at approximately 8% during the first quarter, essentially unchanged from last year, indicating customer demand remains durable. Turning to demographic growth. We see a clear favorable trend in the most populous age cohort of 25- to 34-year olds. This swell of young adults is moving into their early 30s, a time of life when many people start to buy their first homes or move from apartments to single-family homes, and we are seeing household formations reflect this demographic shift. And last month, according to the U.S. Census, the home vacancy survey revealed that all mature age cohorts younger than 50 years old posted year-over-year increases in homeownership, the first time this has occurred since 1994. This data indicates the overall financial strength and creditworthiness of today's buyers are far healthier and more resilient than in the last cycle as evidenced by the strong consumer balance sheets resulting from the trillions of dollars in COVID relief measures and the low 3.6% unemployment rate. So the homebuilding industry remains well positioned with significant tailwinds given the historic underbuilding, favorable demographics and consumers with strong finances. As a company, we have a long track record of successful execution, gaining share and driving efficiencies through innovation for our customers. We significantly overachieved our BMC synergy commitments and are ramping up productivity and operational excellence across the entire organization. We will continue to focus our efforts on accelerating our growth in higher-margin value-added products and investing further in our digital solutions platform to advance our goal of transforming the homebuilding industry. For 2022, we have increased our outlook and expect strong double-digit base business growth and significant free cash flow generation. We remain committed to deploying capital into high-return internal investments, accretive bolt-on M&A and share repurchases. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting Military Appreciation Month and its importance to Builders FirstSource. At BFS, we are honored to be a military-friendly employer and to be part of the journey for those who have served our country. One veteran we are particularly proud of is Rodney Hatch, who served as a marine and is now a safety coordinator for multiple locations across our Alabama and Mississippi geographies. Rodney honors and celebrates those who have greatly served our country by creating veteran walls at our locations showcasing those who are now growing their careers with BFS. His spirit of community doesn't stop with his coworkers.  Rodney gives back to local neighborhoods by maintaining blessing boxes and honor system food pantry where people in need can take food and necessities. And when Hurricane Ida hit the area last year, Rodney jumped into action, collecting donations from his fellow team members and delivering them to Louisiana himself. He does all of this on top of this vital role of keeping our people safe, a responsibility he excels at, day in and day out. His safety-first mindset and teachings have helped his 6 locations achieve 0 recordable injuries so far in 2022. People like Rodney are the reason we continue to see year-over-year reductions in our recordable incidents as part of our never-ending drive to 0. We are fortunate to have Rodney on our team, and I thank him for his service for our country and the communities we serve. And I'm grateful to all of our veterans and each of our 28,000-plus team members who embody our core values, putting people first and showing our customers why BFS is the most valuable partner in our industry. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q1 results and provide an update on our improved 2022 financial guidance. Thanks, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry remains resilient and underbuilt, and we believe it will continue to grow in 2022 and beyond. Our momentum is strong. Our industry-leading platform is generating exceptional results, which we expect to continue in the second quarter, the remainder of this year and beyond. Our balanced capital application strategy is delivering significant value to our shareholders. We're committed to organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and continuing to execute share repurchases to generate accretive returns. I remain optimistic on the prospects for our industry, and I'm highly confident in our company's ability to outperform the market over the long term. Priscilla, let's please open the call now for questions. Yes. We said total 1.6 million. It's been a long time since we've been at this level. Yes. I think you're thinking about it right, Jay. We're actually not expecting volumes to significantly decline this year. As Peter mentioned, there's some comparison issues in the back half of the year. We may get -- we're hoping for a little bit of supply chain relief as the year progresses, but we're very confident in not only what we're seeing early in the second quarter. But to your point, given the backlog that's out there and conversations with our customers, the environment is going to remain robust here for the rest of the year. Yes. Thanks for asking that one. We're excited about Hayden, and we're certainly excited about the work that we've got going on with our digital platform, and this is just great recognition of the work and the traction that we're getting in the market. Hayden is the largest customer so far that we've worked with on digital. They are the sixth customer that we have for Omni for homebuilders, but by far the largest at this point. And it's a really cool story actually. Legacy Paradigm had been working with them a year to 18 months ago, and they kind of lost a little bit of traction until our acquisition of Paradigm last summer. And Hayden really realized that the ability to build out this platform and -- with the financial wherewithal that we have and the investment we were committed to making in advancing digital is really what brought them back to the table and allowed us to sign this agreement with them. They also were a legacy BFS customer already in Idaho. So we've got a longstanding relationship with them. And so it was good to see that materialize into the signing of that agreement for Omni. So we're excited about it. To your second part of your question, we do expect things to ramp up. But as you recall, and we've said this the last couple of quarters and certainly in our Investor Day, this is a year where we're investing heavily in that platform to build out our capabilities for digital, in Omni and all the other pieces of the digital platform. And so as we would expect, we will see continued customer adoption of this through the course of this year and into next year. But that $1 billion of revenue is really back-end loaded, in the back half of that period of time and we said that from the beginning, only because of the digital ramp-up that we see coming over the next 3 or 4 years. So a lot of heavy lifting going on by the team. They're doing a great job, and we're excited. Yes. It's a totally unfair question, but we'll answer it anyway, Matt. And I think you hit the nail on the head there. It's really a combination of both. And as we've talked for a long time, both legacy companies and this combination are really stepping on the gas relative to the value-add components in millwork. And we've seen great adoption. But also last year, given the supply chain constraints, we did see builders become a little bit more agnostic on the products that they have taken. And also what you're seeing in our windows, millwork and doors, this quarter in particular, things were really tough a year ago relative to supply. I would say it's incrementally better now, particularly on interior doors. Window lead times have come down a bit, but there's still quite a backlog. And in fact, some of these products that we're talking about here have actually inhibited the timely closing of homes, as we've talked about over the course of the last year. So I think it's a combination of both of those. But listen, I couldn't be more excited about the momentum that we have around our strategy inside the company, the way our team members have embraced it and also the way our customers are ramping up because we are saving them time, money. And labor availability will remain tight, and we think these products are very sticky. We've seen that through the course of time. And we think there's still a long runway of adoption ahead of us. Well, I really can't speak to what our competitors are doing there, Keith, but I can tell you that the phenomenon that we're seeing relative to adoption is not unique to us. It is certainly unique from how hard we're hitting it from our strategy and the way we're investing. I think we have a leg up on our competitors with the capital that we can deploy, preferentially to value added. And we are certainly doing that as we are spending a disproportionate amount of our capital on these assets for both organic growth and as you've seen over the course of time here, the acquisitions that we're doing. And we will continue to do that through the course of time. Yes. I think you'll see us, again, continue to invest heavily in value add. There are a number of potential targets still out there. Love our footprint, love what we're doing across the country, but we will take opportunities to strengthen the value-added side of the business differentially through M&A through the course of time. Thanks, Reuben. And as I said, Ryan, all 3 of our operating divisions, West, Central and East, had double-digit core organic growth in the quarter. So to Peter's point, very consistent. Some ebbs and flows in certain geographies, but very strong overall. Thanks, Noah. And it is a disproportionate amount of the capital we're spending in total for the company into those value-added products. Yes. Very good question. And we've commented on this in the past. I think the strength of our platform since the merger is enabling exactly what you highlighted there, which is we believe we're getting a disproportionate amount of share from our suppliers. These are long-standing relationships. And importantly, they're symbiotic relationships. We're equally important to our suppliers as they are to us, and we've got really good momentum in those relationships. To your point around supply, I think, incrementally, I would say, as I think I commented earlier, windows were slightly better than they were a year ago, interior doors, lumber is more readily available. But to your point, I would expect things like engineered wood products to be constrained in supplied for a long time to come. Exterior doors are still tight. Siding and trim are difficult. Some of that -- some of those products are even still on allocation. So it really is a mixed bag. And when we say we're incrementally better than we were a year ago, I mean exactly that. Some are better, some are no better. And there's some that are no better, unfortunately, we think, are going to be in tight supply for quite some time to come."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to take a moment and thank each one of our team members who delivered an incredible first quarter of 2022. We are very pleased with our remarkable first quarter results. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment through 2022 and beyond as we leverage our strong cash flow to make accretive investments in our operations and add great businesses to the BFS family, all while executing against our share repurchase authorizations. I will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our Q1 results. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment efforts. And finally, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full year 2022. Let's begin with our Q1 performance on Slide 10. We had net sales of $5.7 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 36% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products grew by an estimated 30.8%, underlining our work to meet the strong demand across our value-added channels and the continued supply chain constraints. Our focus on value-added products continues to strengthen our appeal to customers looking to improve efficiency on the job site. Gross profit was $1.8 billion, a 71% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The gross margin percentage increased 670 basis points to 32.3%, primarily driven by disciplined pricing in a volatile, supply-constrained marketplace as well as effective and timely sourced. SG&A was $968.6 million, an increase of $147 million or 17.9% compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by acquisitions and variable compensation. Variable and incentive compensation increased due to core organic growth and improved profitability. We also made strategic investments in IT, productivity and digital initiatives. Lastly, fuel-related expenses increased by $12 million or nearly 50% due to recent global events. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 270 basis points to 17%. Adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 120% to $1 billion driven by strong demand across our key customer end markets, higher commodity prices and improved gross margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 17.6%, increasing 670 basis points compared to the prior year period as we continue to manage spending in a fast-growing environment. Net income in the quarter was $639.6 million or $3.56 per share compared to net income of $172.6 million or $0.83 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $700.8 million or $3.90 of adjusted EPS compared to the net income of $296.3 million or $1.42 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. The 136.5% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income taxes and SG&A expenses. Now let's turn to cash flow. Our first quarter cash provided by operating activities was $179.8 million, and cash used in investing activities was $48.3 million. We generated free cash flow of $131.5 million. I'll highlight the fact that we are cash flow-positive in Q1 for the first time. Historically, in the first half of the year, we are a net borrower as we make seasonal increases in working capital. This quarter's positive cash flow really highlights the strength of our market-leading platform. Let's turn to capital deployment. This year, we have spent approximately $180 million on our M&A transactions which closed in April. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for roughly $286 million at an average stock price of $79.58. In addition, we repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares in April 2022 for $266.9 million at an average stock price of $62.21. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $552.9 million of stock. The number of shares repurchased was lower than the past 2 quarters primarily due to the timing of M&A and seasonal working capital needs. Since August 2021, we have repurchased approximately 35.3 million shares of stock at an average price of $65.10 for $2.3 billion. This represents almost 17% of our total shares outstanding in less than a year. I'm happy to announce that yesterday, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of $2 billion. When added to the $2.3 billion already repurchased, our authorization provides for $4.3 billion of total share repurchases. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing our stock and continuing to create value for our shareholders. Also on Slide 11, our pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.9x our actual EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2027. Our total liquidity was $1.2 billion, consisting of approximately $900 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $282 million of cash on hand. We are off to a great start this year. The team is driving higher-margin products, delivering value and efficiency to our customers, and our balance sheet remains rock solid. Let's shift gears and discuss updated '22 full year outlook on Slide 12. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. We are maintaining our estimate of single-family starts growth across our geographies in the mid-single digits and R&R and multifamily growth in the low to mid-single digits. As we discussed last quarter, we are providing you with our base business guide on net sales and EBITDA as we believe this is a better measurement of our performance and assumes constant commodity costs at $400 per thousand board foot. We will continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart in our investor presentation to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. As a result of our Q1 performance, we are increasing our 2022 base business sales growth guidance from 8% to 12% to 10% to 14% or $17.6 billion at the midpoint. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA growth guidance from 12% to 18% to 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the midpoint. Our CapEx forecast came down $20 million due to supply chain delays and is expected to be approximately $390 million in 2022. This year's CapEx will be focused on adding capacities to existing and establishing new value-added facilities to support growth initiatives that will create capacity for higher-margin products. We delivered $55 million in cost synergies to the P&L in the first quarter, fully recognizing the synergy commitments of the BMC merger. In addition, we expect to deliver over $100 million in productivity savings this year as we continue to drive improvements across our operations. We expect to generate free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.4 billion in 2022, reflecting higher commodity prices, disciplined working capital management and our ability to capitalize on our industry-leading product portfolio. This is an increase of $400 million from last quarter's free cash flow guide. Our projected free cash flow assumes average commodity prices in the range of $700 to $1,000 for the full year. We still anticipate working capital coming down due to lower commodity prices in the back half of 2022. On Slide 13, we provide the sensitivity chart I mentioned, providing an illustrative way to think about our total sales and total adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 at various static commodity price points. We believe 2022 will be another strong year of growth. We continue to focus on growing value-added products, driving operational excellence across the company and delivering innovative technology to our customers. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Mike, yes, it's a good question. There's certainly been a lot going on this year, as you know, the volatility in the markets, the supply chain issues, the ups and downs in commodity pricing. What we've been looking at is an exceptionally strong first half of the year. We knew it would be strong. I'm not sure we knew it would be this strong in terms of the dynamics. What we're anticipating is that the back half of this year, we'll see some normalization, that we'll see a directional trend in commodity prices back towards our long-term estimate around the base business, $400. Probably won't get there by year-end, but it will head that way. We also anticipate seeing increasing relief in the supply chain space. The interruptions we've seen historically due to the -- basically, the illness and the manufacturing facilities around some of the components we need to build homes, that's been improving pretty steadily over the course of the year. And as more capacity either comes on board or the supply chain stabilizes, we think that will normalize things a little bit in the back half as well. But pretty modestly, we think for the full year, the underlying market is still strong, margins will remain strong, but it will start to drift back towards a more normal level as the year progresses. Yes. No -- but again, that's a good point that's -- that page is really focused around trying to layer on the impact of commodities over top of the core base business, right? So we did call up the base our -- both sales and EBITDA beat pretty handily. I think we beat by about 5% in terms of what we're guiding for the full year. That was really based on Q1 performance. So really, that's a really nice run rate in terms of what we've seen so far. That's the biggest kind of underlying factor on Slide 13 with the sensitivities. The only thing I'll highlight on that slide, just as a reminder, this is a -- it's a bit of a blunt instrument. We think it's handy. We think it's helpful. But just please remember this is a static commodity price snap the line. So volatility in commodity prices will move these numbers around. Yes. Really a remarkable number, looking back through history. Yes. Thanks, Matt. The numbers do include the components you described. We certainly have had good success in organic growth on top of our M&A work. As you described, there are certainly some inflationary factors in the market. Our guide for this year tends to account for them in a balanced way and kind of forecast that out. But as I mentioned, if we do see relief from the supply chain, some of that inflationary influence will start to dissipate. Timing is a great question, and we've tried to incorporate that the back half in a reasonable way as our trend is down sort of analytics, but -- that's really what we're trying to account for in this forecast for the remainder of the year. Yes. We're really meeting a need there. The amount of stress builders are under to get homes completed, it's hard on them, right, with all of the supply chain disruption. So this is an area, by leveraging what we do best, that they can make their lives easier, they can be more efficient, they can be more effective. So it's certainly been really good momentum, and we think our positioning strategically, as Dave was saying, is powerful. Yes. No, that's a good question. And it really does boil down to the dynamics, whether it's attributable directly to COVID or supply chain interruptions, post-COVID, combined with that demand that we're referring to in some of our scripted commentary. The push, the amount of interest from homebuyers and the resulting drive by homebuilders to meet that demand has really put pressure on an industry that over the years has just shrunken down its capacity post kind of the go-go years of the early 2000s. So getting to that limit of available capacity is, I think, in a lot of ways, just pushed us up the bell curve. It is what it is. We're responding to it and managing it very, very well, I think. Staying disciplined, disciplined in the way that we purchase, the way that we partner with vendors and with customers to keep the supply chain moving the best we can. But that has certainly created opportunities along the way to manage profits and to push through the product that we know we can get. I do think over time, though, that supply chain, that difficulty will start to release a little bit, right? It'll alleviate. And as more product becomes available to more folks broadly in the market, we do think there will be a normalization. So you're right, we have not updated our normal gross margin guide. It's still 27% or higher in the long term. We still think we're on track for our LRP goals, but there'll be some ups and downs along the way in our estimation. Yes. No. Unfortunately, it's really just supply chain. We've got orders out for rolling stock and equipment and buildings and all these things we're trying to do. And unfortunately, it's just slower moving than we would have hoped. There was an article in The Journal yesterday, I think, about just how hard it is to get heavy-duty trucks. Lead times are long, and the chip and supply chain shortages in that industry have really made it harder on us. We're spending more on R&M, just trying to keep up with the units we have versus getting the new ones we would rather have. It was. Yes. No. It really doesn't. It's an endpoint target in 2025. So to your point, the path to get there I don't think is important. It certainly is informative as we go through this process that it's a base business guide, right? So all these changes you see in commodities and cash flows along the way, at least so far, have been incremental. But you're right, there's plenty of opportunity for us to move through unusual markets along the way to that ultimate target. We certainly can. I'm not sure I can do it off the top of my head. We can cover it and give you sort of the bigger pieces when we talk or we can get back to you in an e-mail, if that's helpful. Yes. So there's -- I mean, I'll say this the right way. We have certainly continued to see strength across the end markets. There are certainly regional strengths that we notice. I would say the central and south part of the country certainly doing the strongest, but all of the markets are up geographically. Some mix between products, some mix between what we're seeing in sort of the single-family core, which I think has kept really good momentum versus the R&R, which we think we -- I think we've seen some ebbs and flows. Whenever you see significant increases in commodity prices, for example, that can sometimes put a headwind on the total demand. But on average, in total, everything -- each one of the pieces and in total, everything is green and positive year-to-date so far. Good momentum. Well, I certainly think they would take it if we could build it fast enough. The challenge today is really just getting the capacity on the ground and available to them to shorten the existing lead times. But it's -- what I think is important to highlight here is that it's really opened the eyes, I think, of more builders than ever to the advantages to what offsite fabricated components can do for builders who want to professionalize and be really good at their art and craft of homebuilding. It's an important part of it. No question. We haven't broken out the PBM. We might at some point in the future, but it was meaningful. Well, we certainly won't give a specific guidance like that, but I will say that our strategy is consistent. We're not going off script on this. We're going to prioritize investing in the company, making sure our debt is in the right position, making sure our investment in organic internal growth is right. We've committed to continuing to do smart, accretive tuck-in acquisitions. We're going to continue to do that, as you've seen. But we're generating a lot of cash. And we think our stock is undervalued, and we've highlighted that as a pathway that we think is a smart thing to do for investing. I do think there'll be some normalization. I don't think we're going to get all the way back. There are certain products that will remain elevated for some time. Just barring a significant change that we don't really see coming, that would indicate that the other products would bring it down somewhat. But I would say at this point, no, we don't think that 27% by year-end is right, but a trend in that direction is reasonable to expect. Well, we certainly have capacity constraints now. Our lead times are longer than we would like them to be. We look at ways to improve our ability to deliver to customers all over the country. They talked about our board feet per man-hour productivity metric, where we're trying to get the -- more production out of the same. We've talked in the past about adding shifts. We continue to do that. We continue to add lines, and we continue to add plans. So we're double-digit equivalent plans in any given year in terms of everything we're doing. But then that is -- that comes with its own challenges in terms of available components to put into that, the people we need to do that. But it's certainly a focus on meeting that demand because it's impressive right now, and it's something that obviously we do very well. It's pretty broad-based. I would say the timing of different products and how they moved throughout the last 1.5 years have been varied. But I think it's fair to say that it's a pretty wide range, pretty broad brush increase in pricing that we've seen come through the channel. Yes. Thanks, Collin. So the productivity is an exciting part of the business. I think there's a lot of history in our company at finding ways to drive improvement. And we think we have a real opportunity at this stage at our scale to really share those best practices and leverage people, process and technology to continue the momentum that we've seen with the synergy savings from BMC. It's a variety of things. It's process. It's redesigning certain things that we work on, but it hits a lot of different areas, right? It's reporting, driving over time. It's changing the architecture of certain organizations. It's improving our ability to optimize our tax rate. It is -- they're all things that we think are going to drive the business over the next long range of time. Good businesses do it regularly, year in, year out. And we certainly think that we have the capability to do it. What we're looking to do is make it a more normal part of our cadence and less dependent on big acquisitions to be a catalyst for that. So we did build a number into our long-range plan. So we certainly have accounted for that SG&A improvement in the numbers. I can be candid and tell you it's not equal to the 3% to 5% target we're going to set for ourselves. We're going to be more aggressive with what we push for. And we're going to commit to our long-range plan having a number lower than that, but success, nonetheless. So we certainly feel good about it, and we feel good about our track record and being able to continue to drive those types of improvements in a variety of areas. Yes. I mean that's a good question. While we're not at all concerned with what we think the market is doing or where it will go, we're also not blind to the idea that this is a cyclical business at times and mortgage rates are going up. So we're going to fall back on the playbook and the leadership that we're so lucky to have. We have a lot of experienced leaders that have been through these types of situations before. And when we look at our ability to perform, we're certainly very, very pleased with our starting point. To be more specific, we are clearly a better scale, a more efficient and leaner organization. We have better analytics and a better ability to monitor our performance than at any point in our history. We've taken out what is over $500 million in costs as a result of the combined mergers over the last 5 to 10 years. Those are really important things to consider when you look at what our business will perform -- how our business will perform in the face of a headwind environment. More specifically, we have some really obvious actions, right? We manage variable expenses every day. And as the volumes of our business shift, we're going to stay very focused on making sure we're sized accordingly. At our scale, we have a lot of pathways available to us. We also talked about operational excellence and productivity. Those are important characteristics that we will leverage into any sort of headwind environment.  And the other factor to think about is that when we are investing in our company, the biggest investment we make in any given year is really about working capital. And that working capital that we fund as we grow this business comes back to us in those moments when the business sees downturn. We've seen it in past years. We've done a good job at it, and we know we can do it in any environment. That's certainly something that I think is important for investors to keep in mind, just how much cash we spin off in any sort of downside environment. There are more on the list of things we can do, but we're certainly prepared for any sort of downturn. At the same time, we're confident that the market is strong and our momentum is very, very good in this market today. Yes. So the nature of our committed improvement in performance and financial performance when we did the Paradigm announcement, and subsequent to that, we feel good about confirming our estimates. That $1 billion of increased sales by year 5 is primarily driven by increased pull-through of what BFS sells. So if you think about what we're offering into the marketplace, it's improved capabilities for homebuilders and homebuyers to make the build process more efficient, right? It's taking plans. Having configurable visualizations is a powerful tool, especially when you link it to structural design. And that capability is unique and it's powerful in terms of what it allows us to do for our customers. It allows us to offer more options. It allows us to offer more value add. It makes us more efficient in our ability to give good quotes and be better partners for our customers. And it's just easier to place an order, easier to work with us when you're leveraging those technologies that Paradigm has developed. So that's where we believe we're going to make our money. It's incremental sales in those core business markets in value add. There'll be more. We'll certainly see licensing revenue. We think there are other revenue streams through the Paradigm platform. But initially, that's the biggest impact in terms of what we've committed to do."

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.\nHeather Kos: Good morning. And welcome to our third quarter earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the investor presentation during our call.

We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave.\nDavid Rush: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'm proud of our full-year results. I'm proud of our full-year results, which demonstrate the strength of our broad product portfolio and continued execution by our team members. Despite a challenging operating environment in 2023, which saw significant reduction in single-family starts, we delivered resilient results. As promised, we delivered a double-digit EBITDA margin in the high teens along with robust free cash flow. We accomplished this through operational rigor and by closely partnering with our customers to help address their pain points through the use of our value-added solutions. Our results in 2023 further validate our strategy to be the easiest to do business with across the industry. I also want to thank everyone who participated both in person and virtually at our Investor Day in December, where we laid out the next leg of our growth journey. We're grateful for your ongoing support. As we begin 2024, we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We remain focused on profitable growth by leading with our value-added solutions, deploying our digital platform, and expanding in desirable markets through our proven M&A strategy. These initiatives, along with our commitment to efficient operations and disciplined capital deployment, will continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Our investments in value-added and digital solutions are driving clear market differentiation, delivering greater efficiency, and empowering the next generation of home building. By leveraging our scale in value-added products, we are able to help meet our customers' needs, such as reducing cycle times, addressing labor constraints, and improving home construction quality. As a proof point of our execution, I'm pleased that our service levels for on-time and in-full have continued to improve year-over-year. Our on-time delivery was 90% in 2023, while our in-full performance was 96%. With our investments in technology and automation, we'll keep working to drive these metrics higher. We remain committed to operational excellence and innovation to increase efficiency and create value. We have a robust set of operational and productivity initiatives and are focused on leveraging our scale and fixed costs while delivering the highest quality products to our customers. Our continuous improvement mindset employs technology, including our digital solutions and automation, to improve the construction process and drive greater discipline in our operations. As an important pillar of our strategy, we are focused on maintaining a fortress balance sheet. Our strong free cash flow provides financial flexibility and multiple high returning paths for capital deployment, enabling our clear set of priorities. We continued our robust buyback program in 2023, repurchasing nearly $1.8 billion of shares. I'm happy to announce that yesterday our board increased our share repurchase authorization to a total of $1 billion. We remain disciplined in our approach to tuck-in acquisitions and still have a long runway of targets in a fragmented market. Our focus areas for M&A include increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions, and enhancing customer stickiness. Let's turn to our full year highlights on slide 4. We delivered strong margins in 2023, including a robust 17% adjusted EBITDA margin that underscores our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Our resilient gross margin of more than 35% reflects stronger mix in value-added products, notably in our multifamily business, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. As we have communicated, we continue to see some normalization in core margins. We are also seeing multifamily normalized and expected to continue over the course of this year. Looking at slide 5, I want to highlight the over 30% improvement in our recordable incident rate in 2023, which is a remarkable achievement. At BFS, the safety of our team members is always our highest priority, and I am proud of the culture we have created to be a safer company every day. I am also excited to see the structural improvements we are making to remove excess costs and operate more efficiently. Our strong productivity savings of $175 million for 2023 reflect the hard work we are doing on targeted initiatives, and we expect another $100 million of productivity savings in 2024. Prudent SG&A expense management also remains a key focus area. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for cost reductions against future capacity demands. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending, and our team has responsibly managed cost in the short term while executing our strategy for the long term. As expected, we had a strong year in multifamily as prior year acquisitions were supercharged by a strong market. Multifamily remained a tailwind in Q4 as we worked through record backlogs. For single family, lower mortgage rates and low existing home inventories have helped us steady activity levels. National builder customers have done a good job of utilizing specs in conjunction with interest rate buy-downs to provide homebuyers with affordable options to purchase new homes. Our focus this year is on being the best partner to our customers by providing the highest quality customer service, driving our robust value-added solutions, and launching our BFS digital tools to make the building process faster, more efficient, and more affordable. Turning to M&A on slide 6, we continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In 2023, we completed seven deals with aggregate 2022 sales of roughly $540 million. Early in the fourth quarter, we acquired Standale Lumber, which gives us a strong presence in the growing Grand Rapids, Michigan market. Then in December, we acquired Encore Building Products, a leading building materials distributor that represents our entry into the Arkansas market and will serve as our platform for future growth in the state. And in early February, we acquired Quality Door and Millwork, a leading distributor of millwork doors and windows in Southern Idaho. We're excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. We also show how our M&A and organic investments increased value-added products as a percent of overall mix by 700 basis points over the past two years. Our success with this strategy has been a core component of our improved margin profile through the cycle. On slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we made two tuck-in acquisitions and repurchased over $200 million of shares while maintaining a strong balance sheet. And for all 2023, we prudently deployed approximately $2.5 billion in-line with our stated priorities. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $6.1 billion from 2022 through 2023, and we communicated a new goal at our investor day this past December to deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026. Now let's turn to slides eight and nine for an update on our digital strategy. We are establishing a differentiated position as the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space. Combined with our leading operating model and strong relationships, we believe BFS Digital Tools will be a substantial driver of growth for us and transformative for the industry. Our easy-to-use mybldr.com portal will seamlessly deliver our full digital capabilities to our customers. It is designed to create efficiencies for our team members and improve service for our customers by offering increased transparency and engagement in the home building process. Combined with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, our customers will have more control over the entire building process. This will save both time and money for both our customers and their clients while making the home building process more personalized. We are excited to showcase the full digital product capabilities at the International Builders Show next week. To drive the adoption of these innovative solutions, we have focused on training our sales and operations teams to help our customers leverage these powerful new tools. We are confident in our ability to deliver value from our digital solutions and meet our target of $200 million of incremental digital revenue by the end of this year and $1 billion by 2026 as we grow wallet share and new customers. Throughout the year, we acknowledge team members that go above and beyond. Rich Rapuzi, market manager in our Alaska market embodies these values like no other. I had the pleasure of spending time with Rich recently and witnessed the positive impact he has made on his team during his remarkable 50-year career at BFS and Legacy companies. Rich's journey started as a customer service rep in 1974 and is rooted in hands-on experience and continuous learning. Through his career, Rich established vital departments and assumed multiple leadership roles. What truly sets Rich apart is his passion for his community and mentoring others. His colleagues will tell you that he deeply cares about helping people reach their potential. As Rich prepares for retirement later this year, his impact will endure through the lives he has touched. While he'll be greatly missed, his legacy will resonate within our organization for years to come. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our results throughout the year demonstrate the effectiveness of our operating model regardless of the macro environment. Our fortress balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and ability to prudently deploy capital to the highest return opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases, continues to deliver value and positions us for long-term success. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and create value for our shareholders. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our full year 2024 guidance and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slides 10 and 11. We delivered $4.2 billion in net sales, driven by a 1% decline in core organic sales and commodity deflation of 5%, partially offset by growth from acquisitions of roughly 2%. The core organic sales were driven by a single-family decline of 4% amid a weak housing market and share in supply chain normalization. That said, there are signs that the single-family market is starting to pick up. Our early cycle products are beginning to show growth, including high single digits growth in lumber and mid-single digits growth in truss. Multifamily grew by more than 4% driven by our prior year acquisitions as well as favorable margins. R&R and other also grew by over 4% due to increased sales focus and capacity versus 2022. Importantly, value-added products represented 52% of our net sales during the fourth quarter, reflecting our position as the supplier of choice for these higher-margin products. During the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 35.3%, increasing 120 basis points mainly due to productivity and a tailwind from multifamily, partially offset by core organic margin normalization. SG&A increased by $60 million to $974 million, mainly due to higher variable compensation, acquired operations and inflation, partially offset by lower customer reserve expenses. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 150 basis points to 23.5%, primarily attributable to decreased fixed cost leverage from lower sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $686 million, down approximately 2%, primarily driven by lower net sales due to a weak housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior year as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income of $439 million was down $32 million from the prior year due to lower net sales. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.55, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our 2023 operating cash flow was approximately $2.3 billion, down $1.3 billion compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a shrinking housing market. Capital expenditures for the year were $430 million, all in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. For the year, our free cash flow yield was approximately 13% while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 28%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1x, while base business leverage was 1.4x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.3 billion consisting of $1.27 billion and net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $70 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $209 million at an average stock price of $131.74 per share. For the full year of 2023, we repurchased nearly $1.8 billion of shares at an average price of $100.49 per share. As Dave mentioned, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock, inclusive of the approximately $200 million remaining on the prior share repurchase plan authorized in April of 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to approve an ability to deploy capital and deliver high returns. Now let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $17.5 million to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 14% to 15%, and we are guiding gross margins to a range of 30% to 33%. Our recent above normal margins reflect a greater mix of value-added products, along with the disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs. As we move through the year, we expect both our gross margins and the multifamily business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The change from 2023 is primarily due to an expected $500 million year-over-year decrease due to working capital as we move from shrinking to growing sales. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per 1,000 [indiscernible] our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and Slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions. As you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance, but we wanted to provide directional color for Q1. On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q1 net sales to be flat to down low single digits as we have lost roughly two days of sales due to inclement weather conditions at the start of the year. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be down high teens to low 20s in Q1 given the impact of extreme weather and continued margin and share normalization. We expect our sales to rebound as the severe weather conditions subside. Regardless, we remain optimistic for a healthy housing market in 2024. Turning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $17.6 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.4 billion at a margin of 13.5%. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create shareholder value in any environment to support profitable growth. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.\nDavid Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we are focused on executing our strategic pillars. This focus, along with our close partnership with our customers to address their pain points is a competitive differentiator in our industry. We are the unquestioned leader in value-added solutions, which we believe are the most effective way to address labor and cycle time challenges. Our industry-leading digital innovations are bringing greater efficiency to homebuilding and will win us new customers and grow wallet share along the way. Our robust free cash flow generation is funding a disciplined capital deployment strategy that will compound long-term shareholder value. While 2023 was an exciting year, we are just getting started. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Morning Dave Peter thanks for taking the questions. So to start off with on the gross margin, of course, exiting '23 over 35%. I hear you. There is still some multifamily normalizing to come. But it looks like you're guiding to volume growth, of course, in your single-family business this year, and I assume there's some operating leverage there in your manufacturing. I think I heard Dave say that there's another $100 million in productivity this year. And I don't know if you're assuming value-add mix would continue to rise, and that's on top of everything you've done around automation and consolidating the industry and so forth in recent years. So my point is it seems like you've got a lot of tailwinds this year. I guess, where am I being too optimistic? And what's kind of the cadence, timing of gross margins normalizing back to below 33%? Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. Your points are all accurate. I think that we've done a really nice job in the value-add sector. I think we've managed pricing in a disciplined way. We certainly have done a good job on productivity and continuing to execute in that category. And certainly, a portion of that hits gross margins, not all of it. What I think is continuing to happen, and I know this is a consistent theme from us, but we want to continue to be candid with investors. There is a normalization that we're seeing in the core and there's a normalization or maybe a recognition of a cycle in multifamily. Those are the two really big components driving the ongoing normalization that we expect in 2024. So multifamily, as we look at it, certainly a dynamic market, but there's been a pullback, right? A lot of multifamily units were put in the ground. Over the last few years, the backlog has been very full, very healthy, and we've done very, very well. There are clear signals both in the broader market and in our numbers that multifamily is normalizing. It's pulling back, and it's going to pull back pretty aggressively. We expect we'll start seeing that in sort of Q1 based on the latest information, and it will hit us all year. So certainly, multifamily is a good business, but there's a headwind there associated with that business shrinking. And we continue to see in pockets around the country, the normalization of margins in a competitive environment, right? We're well below what we would consider to be normal starts, normal single-family starts in this industry. So it's competitive out there. And there are certain markets where we've had to get aggressive, and we'll continue to do that to protect our position and to win in the market and to be the customer of choice. We don't think it's putting us outside of that communicated range for gross margin, but certainly expect that to continue to erode as the year progresses.\nMatthew Bouley: Second one, I guess, sticking with the guidance, I think your end market growth kind of blends to maybe very low single digits and you're speaking to base business growth of, I think, 7% this year, and I know there's a couple of extra selling days in the second half. But my question is on your growth compared to the market. Sounds like you should start to get some of the digital sales to kick in later this year. But just could you kind of bridge us from where the market is expected this year to your sort of several hundred basis points of market outgrowth? And obviously, of course, how does the value-add growth kind of play into that? Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. You're right. We are anticipating a fairly modest market tailwind this year, which obviously is appreciated, and we'll put to good use. But we are challenging ourselves as an organization in a couple of key areas. A big one that we talked a lot about is digital. We're really excited about what this product is going to do for us in terms of attracting and enhancing our relationships with customers, we think there's real value there. So we're putting that in our number. We also are continuing to invest as you see in value add. So we've got new capacity in the ground. We've got new equipment. We've got a new ability this year that we didn't have last year to provide those types of high-value impactful products to our customers. So we expect growth from that. And we're certainly confident in our team. We've got -- we need to be the best team in the industry, and we think we can win in the market. So those three things really kind of combined to give us the confidence to put out a number there that really represents share growth ultimately.\nDavid Rush: I would just add, Matt, that conversations with customers are almost uniformly optimistic for the year. There are differences in when they believe that timing of that rebound will start, and that's all obviously driven by the macro environment to a degree. And the digital ad that we'll experience during the year will be more like a hockey stick. It will be weighted to the back half of the year as we continue to drive adoption and training throughout the organization and with our customers. But we're excited about the year as a whole. It's a little more difficult to pinpoint the exact point in time when we start seeing it in real time. But the long-term demand still is very, very encouraging.\nOperator: We'll turn now to Mike Dahl with RBC Capital.\nMichael Dahl: Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on free cash flow. I appreciate your articulation of kind of some of those timing differences and the swings in working cap. And so I think as we move beyond 2024 because this represents kind of a lower-than-normal conversion for you. So can you just talk to -- is it kind of timing through the year that -- of how working cap has the ramp -- has growth ramps? And then once we get to '25, you still expect to get back to a higher, more normal conversion rate or any other moving pieces there? I think, would be helpful.\nPeter Jackson: Absolutely. So you're right, Mike. This is a light year for us. The way that the numbers show, the comp looked obviously pretty dramatic on a year-over-year basis. We're down a little bit on the EBITDA number due to that multifamily step down. But the change going from a business that's shrinking. And as you know, we spent off a tremendous amount of cash as the business shrinks to turn to an increasing sales environment. And we use working capital when we grow. That sort of turn for us showed large in the numbers. But that headwind that we would expect to see related to growth is generally going to be a little bit smaller in a normal growth year than in a turn year. The turn year is always a big number when it goes from one to the other. So we do anticipate it to be a little bit higher in a normal year. And as we laid out in our Investor Day, there's a cumulative benefit that we expect to deliver on, and that commitment hasn't changed.\nOperator: We'll turn now to Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.\nJoseph Ahlersmeyer: Hey, good morning guys. Congrats on the results. So is it right to think that if we've got the headwind from weather in 1Q, we're going to be probably pushing those sales more into 2Q. I'm just trying to think about the phasing of sales for the remainder of the year.\nPeter Jackson: I think that's a fair assessment, Joe. Typically, what we see is it's not an immediate snapback but a gradual snapback in the future quarters as they catch up. They don't catch up all at once. But at the end of the day, we actually do feel like what we lost in the first quarter due to weather will ultimately pick up in the back three quarters of the year.\nJoseph Ahlersmeyer: And then looking at your guidance for the all-in business and the base business, is it right to think about the commodity element of this as a full normalization of the multifamily? Are we getting sort of all of both the commodity normalization and market normalization in these '24 numbers? And then maybe if you could just talk about going forward, the opportunity within multifamily kind of between the five and below units versus the much larger projects?\nPeter Jackson: That's right, Joe. These business reconciliation of those two components you mentioned is the last of the multifamily and the last of a little bit of the core not much left, which is nice, but that's certainly a piece of it.\nDavid Rush: And I would tell you, you're exactly right; our sales teams that have focused on the larger projects partly because their customers are also looking for opportunities in the smaller projects that still qualified technically as multifamily or light commercial. We're all focused on those opportunities and those will help us bridge that headwind a little easier for the rest of the year. But it still takes a little bit of time for those projects to get out of the ground. And the timing of that makes it a little difficult, but only focused on that opportunity.\nOperator: We'll turn now to Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: Hey, good morning, Dave and Peter. Peter, you mentioned that there's -- you're seeing some evidence of residential starting to turn around. And I think you noted seeing high single-digit growth in lumber and low single-digit growth in truss. I guess what's the timing you're referring to there? Is that since January? Just some color on the time frame there? And then secondly, is there any reason why truss would be trending slower than lumber? I mean I didn't know if there would be anything going there from a mix standpoint or something? I would just assume value add would at least stay in pace with lumber or maybe outpace, just any color there?\nPeter Jackson: Thanks for the question, Trey. So the time frame we're talking about was 4Q. So it was a fourth quarter dynamic. I think the storyline here, and we talked about it a bit in the past, but for those maybe who haven't heard it, what we sell goes into a start at a wide range of time lines, right? So lumber is generally very, very early. It's not unusual to frame the first floor and then have maybe the trusses delivered. There is a very close correlation between framing and trust. No argument there. I think that in general, it's indicative of the beginning of the turn. What's also true is some of the later products, you go through windows and you got out to doors and trim, that's later in the build process. And those are the products that you notice we didn't talk about as being turned and in good position. It's very reflective of last year. At the end of '22, you saw lumber and truss go down really hard. Lumber down a lot more than truss. So on a comparison basis, that's part of the answer as well that lumber was down aggressively if you go back to the numbers for the fourth quarter of last year. So on a comp basis, it's up a little bit more, but really because it was down a little bit.\nDavid Rush: I mean, lumber and truss go hand-in-hand together, but value-added is more than truss. I think that's the thing you get from the mind. So value added is later in the process.\nOperator: We'll turn now to Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hey, good morning, very thanks for taking my question. The last quarter, you provided a scenario framework for 2024 on different macro assumptions and then what that would mean for your earnings? Are you -- should we still sort of be comfortable with that. So it starts tracking that 8% to 14% range on the single-family side and lumber is at $4.25 to $4.75. Would you still be looking for $2.7 million to $3.1 in EBITDA? Or has something else changed in the market where we should be thinking about upside or downside to those scenarios?\nPeter Jackson: I think it's fair to say that directionally, those scenarios are still indicative of how we think of the business. There haven't been any real structural changes in any of the variables. It's always subjective to a degree because the ending point for 2023 was a bit different. But generally, yes. No, I think that's a fair way to look at it.\nRafe Jadrosich: That's really helpful. And then just as you look at the gross margin guidance for this year, is it 30% to 33%. And it's really in line with your long-term target despite single-family starts that are tracking below. I think the long-term assumption is $1.1 million. As we look forward here, if you have years where the starts are below that target, do you think you'll be able to do gross margin kind of above 30%? Or is there something unique to '24 that's keeping it higher? Is that just because you still have some multifamily that's flowing through?\nPeter Jackson: It's a really good question. I think confidence, our confidence this year comes from that normalization component. We still have some above what we consider to be normal margins in multifamily and in a couple of product categories in a few pockets around the country. We're continuing to see that normalization. We're continuing to see some of that compete back to what we consider to be a likely normal. That said, we're obviously very good. It's very strong, and we're feeling very confident about our ability to manage it in the long term. At this stage, I think it's hard to say that it's an exact point of starts that correlates to an exact point in gross margins. I think we're most comfortable talking about it in sort of ranges around normal. It feels like a range around margins. But right now, a lot of confidence that we can hold in that normal range based on everything we're seeing.\nDavid Rush: And what I would add is our belief in the resilience of that range and the fact that we can hold within that range is our belief in our value-added product portfolio and solutions. Those are the products that are more valuable to our customers and as a result, more have a better margin opportunity for us. And as we continue to grow that as a percentage of our overall sales is always going to help that gross margin number be more resilient.\nOperator: We will now turn to Keith Hughes with Truist.\nKeith Hughes: I don't think your projection here is aligned with what's thought in the market, just specific to Builders First Source. When do you think this is going to really start impacting your business? And if you talk about the unit loss versus margin loss that's been such a positive for '23, that would be helpful.\nPeter Jackson: I mean, timing is a tough thing to predict, as you know, Keith. I think based on what we're seeing in and hearing, in the market is healthy. We've certainly seen some positive signs early in the year. It would be nice if the Fed helped, can't lie based on everything that's kind of out there in the public markets, it feels like a second half dynamic. When we call out the numbers around core organic, there's certainly a big component of it. It's primarily price volume mix driven, like we give you the days, we give you the commodities in the price/volume mix space that normalization talking about in margins is certainly an important part, a driver in terms of the normalization of gross margins, it's less of an impact on sales. So the driver this year really has to be unit volumes turning and starting to accelerate again. And that's our expectation, and that's what we're starting to see. So there's certainly a lot of optimism, I would say, at this point, it really becomes a question of timing.\nOperator: We'll turn now to Collin Verron with Jefferies.\nCollin Verron: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to dive into the multifamily, a little bit more in your assumption around that 20% to 30% decline in multifamily starts. I guess, any help in thinking about your sales performance versus that start to decline for the full year, just given the backlog of projects that's still under construction according to the Census Bureau data, and maybe the lag that you would normally see from a start to your sales? And then I guess, second on that, can you just help us think about the cadence of the multifamily stores maybe on a quarterly basis throughout the year to kind of get to that sales performance?\nPeter Jackson: I mean I would say, if you're thinking about our multifamily business, you do have to go back in the rearview mirror a bit, right, in the turn-around what we build, and this is the problem in terms of everybody being able to use the sort of publicly available information. It's a little bit more specific both to markets and what we're building. However, I think what we're seeing right now is that the expected downturn throughout 2024, kind of thought it might hit late in 2023, didn't. I think people were pretty aggressive at trying to get the multifamily projects completed. So we actually saw a nice pull through a little better than we thought of that business in the fourth quarter, but definitely seeing it turn down starting in Q1 in every quarter during the year, you'll see for the multifamily business. Meaningful declines in both sales and margins as the year progresses. Still a really good business. It's just not sort of performing at those two standard deviations above normal levels anymore.\nDavid Rush: I would just add, remember, it's only 13% of our overall business. The other thing I would add is we were at the Harvard Housing Conference, and there were multifamily players there. And it's a cost of capital challenge in addition to all of the multifamily that had been constructed over the last 12 to 18 months is coming to market all at the same time. So there's a little bit of a digestion of that in addition to solving the capital cost equation. But again, just like in single-family, the long-term outlook for multifamily is very positive when you look at the demand curve and what people need housing and what multifamily satisfies for that population. So long term, we're still very positive on the business. And we do know we'll have to manage some of the cost -- the capital challenges at or there today. But again, 13% of our business.\nCollin Verron: And then I just wanted to touch on productivity, which continues to be a pretty meaningful tailwind for you guys. Can you just talk about the projects you're looking to benefit from in 2024 and maybe the size of the project pipeline beyond 2024?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. The productivity initiatives are in two kind of camps. One is how can we improve our productivity through automation and technology and then how can we do it through best practices. The benefit of our scale, our 550-plus locations, is the ability to take a best practice across the enterprise and get little chunks of productivity in every single location. So it falls in those two camps. A lot of the automation and technology is around improving customer service, improving truck turnaround times also in the manufacturing environment using automation to get more throughput per labor hour. But that would outline the things we're working on for 2020.\nOperator: We'll go next to Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, good morning. If we look at the market for manufactured products like truss, are you seeing your competitors ramp up capacity as well?\nPeter Jackson: Sure, a little. But I mean scale-wise, we're 5x, 10x, 20x their size. So if they're adding one or two plants in certain markets, we know how to deal with it.\nDavid Rush: I would tell you the other differentiation we have is not just adding locations, it's actually improving the throughput of the locations we already own. We've invested over $100 million in existing plants. Over 65% of our tables have some level of automation. Every plant has some level of automation. So there's a lot of different ways we can extend our lead without building physical plant to do so, and we're focused on that as well.\nAdam Baumgarten: And then just thinking about the M&A environment, are you seeing more willingness by acquisition targets to sell at this point given the improved outlook?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, it's gotten a little better. I think one of the things that was holding back the M&A environment was just uncertainty around the direction of the market and people not knowing where the bottom was and not having sort of kind of a valuation to step off of. And that created disagreements between buyers and sellers. I think that's calmed down a bit. So we're a little bit more optimistic for this year, but deals are unique. Each one is a unicorn. I would say the one thing that's also improved the farther away we've gotten to the unusual commodity impact on numbers. People are now more easily or readily accepting of a base business kind of valuation for the -- for what they have going forward, and that makes the conversations easier.\nOperator: We'll go now to Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: Thanks for taking my question. I was curious if you can talk a little bit about sort of what you're seeing in Q1. I mean you talked about weather being a challenge. But sales, you're pointing to kind of flat to down, but EBITDA is down quite a bit more. Peter, is there any way to sort of think about how much of it is weather-driven versus margin normalization?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. The weather is modest. I think it's two to three days in terms of what we are anticipating in terms of a headwind. So that's not a huge deal. In general with the exception of that component, you've got pretty healthy business, both on a year-over-year basis and on a trending basis. So I think that's a positive. What you are seeing, though, and I think it's fair to point it out is the year-over-year lapping of what we've been talking about. I think you've heard me talk about that normalization of margins. And I've been pretty adamant that behind the scenes, regardless of this multifamily curing it, we have seen business getting back to normal in terms of the supply chain normalizing and are negotiating in the competitive environment, things just settling back down to a more normal level. And you're seeing a little bit of that in terms of the year-over-year again, still a very good number, still a very strong performance for the business, but more in line with what we would expect going forward.\nDavid Rush: I would just add from a customer sentiment perspective, the national biller, customers are seeing increased foot traffic. And more importantly, the foot traffic that they are seeing are more apt to actually buy a home. So the percentage of closings to people looking, I feel like is gaining traction and their ability to match up available inventory and monthly mortgage payment to demand is -- they've done a great job with that. Now where we need a little help from the Fed mortgage rates would be to get the non-national builder customer in an arena where the cost of the mortgage is helping to drive that demand to them. So that less so, but we expect that to be what is the first off the sidelines when we get that movement, but the national builders have done a good job in the existing environment.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Dave Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Hi, good morning everyone. I'm thinking broadly on a product basis. Is the margin differential between commodity and value-added product different than it was five to seven years ago? I assume both categories have moved up. But as we normalize out here and go forward the next three to five, can you just discuss the delta between those two?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, that's fair to say. You're right. We've seen improvements across the Board in terms of margins. Some of that very simply to cover the inflation and the incremental cost, but we have certainly seen an increase and I would also point to our productivity as a driver for why value add has extended its differentiation from commodity. Those Dave referred to $100-plus million worth of investment and the efforts we've put around our team to improve our internal board [indiscernible] hour, our doors per man hour type of productivity metrics has contributed to a bigger differential between value add on average and commodity.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJames McCanless: Hey, good morning everyone. So my question is on the outlook for R&R. I think, up low single digits probably a little bit better, I'd say, than what some of the other national forecasters are expecting. Is that acquisitions driving that? Or do you feel like in those specific markets, you can actually see growth above what people are expecting? .\nPeter Jackson: Jay, thanks for the question. For us, R&R kind of falls into two camps. There's R&R DIY and Retail. And then there's kind of pro-remodel R&R. And I think with us, too, it's market specific. We don't do it everywhere. So that's why there's a little difference in what we believe is going to happen for us, possibly versus some of the national guys and a lot of what I think is a headwind for them are big ticket items that we have never sold and don't sell like appliances, et cetera. So the fact that we have kind of a different product offering to that group a different kind of customer focus and in different parts of the country is why we -- why I believe we might have a little different expectation.\nDavid Rush: Also, I think, taken advantage of capacity availability to lean into it as well, and that's a different component than others might have.\nPeter Jackson: I mean we're such a small player in that overall market segment, it's a little easier for us to kind of grow that if we just focus on it a little bit. And we have the ability to do that in this current environment.\nJames McCanless: And just one other quick question. I think the $200 million you called out, Dave, in terms of incremental digital sales this year. Maybe talk a little bit more about that, what that's going to look like and why you all feel like -- I think this is new guidance for you guys, just kind of why you wanted to talk about that now and what those incremental sales would look like, please?\nPeter Jackson: Perfect. Thank you for teeing that up for me, Jay. Next week, at IBS, we're doing a [indiscernible] product launch. Then we'll be rolling our digital tools out market by market. There's a lot of preparation in training our sales team to then know how to intelligently explain it to our customers and show the benefits to our customers. And that just takes time. And we're doing it market by market. We're making sure we do it right the first time. And as we get momentum, it will -- you'll see the efforts paying off in the later part of the year. And that's why I said more like a hockey stick probably in 2024. But we're really excited about it, and it all starts next week with the IBS product launch.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.\nKurt Yinger: I just wanted to stick with the digital tools and the rollout there. I was hoping you could talk about maybe the cost impact in 2024 and recognizing that the sales are back half weighted, and it's kind of the first year that you're fully rolling these. How should we think about kind of the incremental margins attached to those sales?\nPeter Jackson: Yes Kurt, thanks for the question. So the short answer is we expect the sales pull-through to be pretty consistent with what we're already selling. The costs associated with the digital tools and the development, the rollout and even largely the support is included in the numbers. It's really been spent over the past few years. So there's no -- there's no other material that you're going to see in terms of deltas. The thing we're going to keep a close eye on is what is the support infrastructure necessary to make sure we have the right level of customer experience. We think we have an eye on it, but that's probably the only one that could potentially increase if this really picks up quickly. Again, I don't think it will be big enough to really hit the radar for anybody, even if that were to happen, just based on the service model that we've built out. It's really all about that incremental sales being pulled through from incremental share of wallet and new customers that really like being able to utilize these modern digital tools.\nOperator: We'll move now to Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsey: Wanted to hold in on the installation sales, which at the Investor Day, you estimated at 15% of 2023 sales. I guess, first, is that about where it landed last year? and then thinking for 2024, is there an expectation that installation sales can grow on an absolute basis and where that lands as a percent of the total base business?\nPeter Jackson: Thanks for the question. Installation is definitely a focus point for our strategy for 2024 as it fits very nicely into solving our customers' pain points. We do it successfully in a lot of markets today. We did $2.5 billion of material labor sales in related insulation last year. So our focus is to grow both organically and inorganically. The low-hanging fruit is the markets that we are already doing some level of installation expanding the products that we install in those markets. But we're also looking at new markets that have not done installation in the past. To do that effectively, we put our best people together and we developed an installation playbook that people can access and utilize to grow that business in their markets. And we're always looking for people who are already doing it well today that could fit into our profile through M&A. So we're going to pull all of those levers during the year, but it will be starting in Q2 and then going from there for the most part. And it will be focused on the things we're already good at today.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeffrey Stevenson with Loop Capital.\nJeffrey Stevenson: Are you expecting any price deflation this year in categories such as EWP and millwork, which benefited from supply-driven pricing gains the last several years?\nPeter Jackson: Well, we already saw that in the last part of the year for EWP. I don't know that we'd see too much more of that going forward. And I would call it more supply chain normalization than I would significant deflation. I think they're still challenged with a lot of inflationary operating costs that we all are. So I don't expect that they're going to be able to significantly reduce price. I think it's more holding than where it is right now that we're expecting and hoping for. But quite frankly, it wouldn't surprise me if inflation cause is even price increases going into the year.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session as well as today's event. We want to thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our results throughout the year demonstrate the effectiveness of our operating model regardless of the macro environment. Our fortress balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and ability to prudently deploy capital to the highest return opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases, continues to deliver value and positions us for long-term success. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and create value for our shareholders. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our full year 2024 guidance and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slides 10 and 11. We delivered $4.2 billion in net sales, driven by a 1% decline in core organic sales and commodity deflation of 5%, partially offset by growth from acquisitions of roughly 2%. The core organic sales were driven by a single-family decline of 4% amid a weak housing market and share in supply chain normalization. That said, there are signs that the single-family market is starting to pick up. Our early cycle products are beginning to show growth, including high single digits growth in lumber and mid-single digits growth in truss. Multifamily grew by more than 4% driven by our prior year acquisitions as well as favorable margins. R&R and other also grew by over 4% due to increased sales focus and capacity versus 2022. Importantly, value-added products represented 52% of our net sales during the fourth quarter, reflecting our position as the supplier of choice for these higher-margin products. During the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 35.3%, increasing 120 basis points mainly due to productivity and a tailwind from multifamily, partially offset by core organic margin normalization. SG&A increased by $60 million to $974 million, mainly due to higher variable compensation, acquired operations and inflation, partially offset by lower customer reserve expenses. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 150 basis points to 23.5%, primarily attributable to decreased fixed cost leverage from lower sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $686 million, down approximately 2%, primarily driven by lower net sales due to a weak housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior year as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income of $439 million was down $32 million from the prior year due to lower net sales. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.55, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our 2023 operating cash flow was approximately $2.3 billion, down $1.3 billion compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a shrinking housing market. Capital expenditures for the year were $430 million, all in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. For the year, our free cash flow yield was approximately 13% while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 28%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1x, while base business leverage was 1.4x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.3 billion consisting of $1.27 billion and net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $70 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $209 million at an average stock price of $131.74 per share. For the full year of 2023, we repurchased nearly $1.8 billion of shares at an average price of $100.49 per share. As Dave mentioned, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock, inclusive of the approximately $200 million remaining on the prior share repurchase plan authorized in April of 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to approve an ability to deploy capital and deliver high returns. Now let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $17.5 million to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 14% to 15%, and we are guiding gross margins to a range of 30% to 33%. Our recent above normal margins reflect a greater mix of value-added products, along with the disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs. As we move through the year, we expect both our gross margins and the multifamily business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The change from 2023 is primarily due to an expected $500 million year-over-year decrease due to working capital as we move from shrinking to growing sales. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per 1,000 [indiscernible] our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and Slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions. As you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance, but we wanted to provide directional color for Q1. On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q1 net sales to be flat to down low single digits as we have lost roughly two days of sales due to inclement weather conditions at the start of the year. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be down high teens to low 20s in Q1 given the impact of extreme weather and continued margin and share normalization. We expect our sales to rebound as the severe weather conditions subside. Regardless, we remain optimistic for a healthy housing market in 2024. Turning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $17.6 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.4 billion at a margin of 13.5%. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create shareholder value in any environment to support profitable growth. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts. Thanks, Matt. Your points are all accurate. I think that we've done a really nice job in the value-add sector. I think we've managed pricing in a disciplined way. We certainly have done a good job on productivity and continuing to execute in that category. And certainly, a portion of that hits gross margins, not all of it. What I think is continuing to happen, and I know this is a consistent theme from us, but we want to continue to be candid with investors. There is a normalization that we're seeing in the core and there's a normalization or maybe a recognition of a cycle in multifamily. Those are the two really big components driving the ongoing normalization that we expect in 2024. So multifamily, as we look at it, certainly a dynamic market, but there's been a pullback, right? A lot of multifamily units were put in the ground. Over the last few years, the backlog has been very full, very healthy, and we've done very, very well. There are clear signals both in the broader market and in our numbers that multifamily is normalizing. It's pulling back, and it's going to pull back pretty aggressively. We expect we'll start seeing that in sort of Q1 based on the latest information, and it will hit us all year. So certainly, multifamily is a good business, but there's a headwind there associated with that business shrinking. And we continue to see in pockets around the country, the normalization of margins in a competitive environment, right? We're well below what we would consider to be normal starts, normal single-family starts in this industry. So it's competitive out there. And there are certain markets where we've had to get aggressive, and we'll continue to do that to protect our position and to win in the market and to be the customer of choice. We don't think it's putting us outside of that communicated range for gross margin, but certainly expect that to continue to erode as the year progresses. Thanks, Matt. You're right. We are anticipating a fairly modest market tailwind this year, which obviously is appreciated, and we'll put to good use. But we are challenging ourselves as an organization in a couple of key areas. A big one that we talked a lot about is digital. We're really excited about what this product is going to do for us in terms of attracting and enhancing our relationships with customers, we think there's real value there. So we're putting that in our number. We also are continuing to invest as you see in value add. So we've got new capacity in the ground. We've got new equipment. We've got a new ability this year that we didn't have last year to provide those types of high-value impactful products to our customers. So we expect growth from that. And we're certainly confident in our team. We've got -- we need to be the best team in the industry, and we think we can win in the market. So those three things really kind of combined to give us the confidence to put out a number there that really represents share growth ultimately. Absolutely. So you're right, Mike. This is a light year for us. The way that the numbers show, the comp looked obviously pretty dramatic on a year-over-year basis. We're down a little bit on the EBITDA number due to that multifamily step down. But the change going from a business that's shrinking. And as you know, we spent off a tremendous amount of cash as the business shrinks to turn to an increasing sales environment. And we use working capital when we grow. That sort of turn for us showed large in the numbers. But that headwind that we would expect to see related to growth is generally going to be a little bit smaller in a normal growth year than in a turn year. The turn year is always a big number when it goes from one to the other. So we do anticipate it to be a little bit higher in a normal year. And as we laid out in our Investor Day, there's a cumulative benefit that we expect to deliver on, and that commitment hasn't changed. I think that's a fair assessment, Joe. Typically, what we see is it's not an immediate snapback but a gradual snapback in the future quarters as they catch up. They don't catch up all at once. But at the end of the day, we actually do feel like what we lost in the first quarter due to weather will ultimately pick up in the back three quarters of the year. That's right, Joe. These business reconciliation of those two components you mentioned is the last of the multifamily and the last of a little bit of the core not much left, which is nice, but that's certainly a piece of it. Thanks for the question, Trey. So the time frame we're talking about was 4Q. So it was a fourth quarter dynamic. I think the storyline here, and we talked about it a bit in the past, but for those maybe who haven't heard it, what we sell goes into a start at a wide range of time lines, right? So lumber is generally very, very early. It's not unusual to frame the first floor and then have maybe the trusses delivered. There is a very close correlation between framing and trust. No argument there. I think that in general, it's indicative of the beginning of the turn. What's also true is some of the later products, you go through windows and you got out to doors and trim, that's later in the build process. And those are the products that you notice we didn't talk about as being turned and in good position. It's very reflective of last year. At the end of '22, you saw lumber and truss go down really hard. Lumber down a lot more than truss. So on a comparison basis, that's part of the answer as well that lumber was down aggressively if you go back to the numbers for the fourth quarter of last year. So on a comp basis, it's up a little bit more, but really because it was down a little bit. I think it's fair to say that directionally, those scenarios are still indicative of how we think of the business. There haven't been any real structural changes in any of the variables. It's always subjective to a degree because the ending point for 2023 was a bit different. But generally, yes. No, I think that's a fair way to look at it. It's a really good question. I think confidence, our confidence this year comes from that normalization component. We still have some above what we consider to be normal margins in multifamily and in a couple of product categories in a few pockets around the country. We're continuing to see that normalization. We're continuing to see some of that compete back to what we consider to be a likely normal. That said, we're obviously very good. It's very strong, and we're feeling very confident about our ability to manage it in the long term. At this stage, I think it's hard to say that it's an exact point of starts that correlates to an exact point in gross margins. I think we're most comfortable talking about it in sort of ranges around normal. It feels like a range around margins. But right now, a lot of confidence that we can hold in that normal range based on everything we're seeing. I mean, timing is a tough thing to predict, as you know, Keith. I think based on what we're seeing in and hearing, in the market is healthy. We've certainly seen some positive signs early in the year. It would be nice if the Fed helped, can't lie based on everything that's kind of out there in the public markets, it feels like a second half dynamic. When we call out the numbers around core organic, there's certainly a big component of it. It's primarily price volume mix driven, like we give you the days, we give you the commodities in the price/volume mix space that normalization talking about in margins is certainly an important part, a driver in terms of the normalization of gross margins, it's less of an impact on sales. So the driver this year really has to be unit volumes turning and starting to accelerate again. And that's our expectation, and that's what we're starting to see. So there's certainly a lot of optimism, I would say, at this point, it really becomes a question of timing. I mean I would say, if you're thinking about our multifamily business, you do have to go back in the rearview mirror a bit, right, in the turn-around what we build, and this is the problem in terms of everybody being able to use the sort of publicly available information. It's a little bit more specific both to markets and what we're building. However, I think what we're seeing right now is that the expected downturn throughout 2024, kind of thought it might hit late in 2023, didn't. I think people were pretty aggressive at trying to get the multifamily projects completed. So we actually saw a nice pull through a little better than we thought of that business in the fourth quarter, but definitely seeing it turn down starting in Q1 in every quarter during the year, you'll see for the multifamily business. Meaningful declines in both sales and margins as the year progresses. Still a really good business. It's just not sort of performing at those two standard deviations above normal levels anymore. Yes. The productivity initiatives are in two kind of camps. One is how can we improve our productivity through automation and technology and then how can we do it through best practices. The benefit of our scale, our 550-plus locations, is the ability to take a best practice across the enterprise and get little chunks of productivity in every single location. So it falls in those two camps. A lot of the automation and technology is around improving customer service, improving truck turnaround times also in the manufacturing environment using automation to get more throughput per labor hour. But that would outline the things we're working on for 2020. Sure, a little. But I mean scale-wise, we're 5x, 10x, 20x their size. So if they're adding one or two plants in certain markets, we know how to deal with it. Yes, it's gotten a little better. I think one of the things that was holding back the M&A environment was just uncertainty around the direction of the market and people not knowing where the bottom was and not having sort of kind of a valuation to step off of. And that created disagreements between buyers and sellers. I think that's calmed down a bit. So we're a little bit more optimistic for this year, but deals are unique. Each one is a unicorn. I would say the one thing that's also improved the farther away we've gotten to the unusual commodity impact on numbers. People are now more easily or readily accepting of a base business kind of valuation for the -- for what they have going forward, and that makes the conversations easier. Yes. The weather is modest. I think it's two to three days in terms of what we are anticipating in terms of a headwind. So that's not a huge deal. In general with the exception of that component, you've got pretty healthy business, both on a year-over-year basis and on a trending basis. So I think that's a positive. What you are seeing, though, and I think it's fair to point it out is the year-over-year lapping of what we've been talking about. I think you've heard me talk about that normalization of margins. And I've been pretty adamant that behind the scenes, regardless of this multifamily curing it, we have seen business getting back to normal in terms of the supply chain normalizing and are negotiating in the competitive environment, things just settling back down to a more normal level. And you're seeing a little bit of that in terms of the year-over-year again, still a very good number, still a very strong performance for the business, but more in line with what we would expect going forward. Yes, that's fair to say. You're right. We've seen improvements across the Board in terms of margins. Some of that very simply to cover the inflation and the incremental cost, but we have certainly seen an increase and I would also point to our productivity as a driver for why value add has extended its differentiation from commodity. Those Dave referred to $100-plus million worth of investment and the efforts we've put around our team to improve our internal board [indiscernible] hour, our doors per man hour type of productivity metrics has contributed to a bigger differential between value add on average and commodity. Jay, thanks for the question. For us, R&R kind of falls into two camps. There's R&R DIY and Retail. And then there's kind of pro-remodel R&R. And I think with us, too, it's market specific. We don't do it everywhere. So that's why there's a little difference in what we believe is going to happen for us, possibly versus some of the national guys and a lot of what I think is a headwind for them are big ticket items that we have never sold and don't sell like appliances, et cetera. So the fact that we have kind of a different product offering to that group a different kind of customer focus and in different parts of the country is why we -- why I believe we might have a little different expectation. I mean we're such a small player in that overall market segment, it's a little easier for us to kind of grow that if we just focus on it a little bit. And we have the ability to do that in this current environment. Perfect. Thank you for teeing that up for me, Jay. Next week, at IBS, we're doing a [indiscernible] product launch. Then we'll be rolling our digital tools out market by market. There's a lot of preparation in training our sales team to then know how to intelligently explain it to our customers and show the benefits to our customers. And that just takes time. And we're doing it market by market. We're making sure we do it right the first time. And as we get momentum, it will -- you'll see the efforts paying off in the later part of the year. And that's why I said more like a hockey stick probably in 2024. But we're really excited about it, and it all starts next week with the IBS product launch. Yes Kurt, thanks for the question. So the short answer is we expect the sales pull-through to be pretty consistent with what we're already selling. The costs associated with the digital tools and the development, the rollout and even largely the support is included in the numbers. It's really been spent over the past few years. So there's no -- there's no other material that you're going to see in terms of deltas. The thing we're going to keep a close eye on is what is the support infrastructure necessary to make sure we have the right level of customer experience. We think we have an eye on it, but that's probably the only one that could potentially increase if this really picks up quickly. Again, I don't think it will be big enough to really hit the radar for anybody, even if that were to happen, just based on the service model that we've built out. It's really all about that incremental sales being pulled through from incremental share of wallet and new customers that really like being able to utilize these modern digital tools. Thanks for the question. Installation is definitely a focus point for our strategy for 2024 as it fits very nicely into solving our customers' pain points. We do it successfully in a lot of markets today. We did $2.5 billion of material labor sales in related insulation last year. So our focus is to grow both organically and inorganically. The low-hanging fruit is the markets that we are already doing some level of installation expanding the products that we install in those markets. But we're also looking at new markets that have not done installation in the past. To do that effectively, we put our best people together and we developed an installation playbook that people can access and utilize to grow that business in their markets. And we're always looking for people who are already doing it well today that could fit into our profile through M&A. So we're going to pull all of those levers during the year, but it will be starting in Q2 and then going from there for the most part. And it will be focused on the things we're already good at today. Well, we already saw that in the last part of the year for EWP. I don't know that we'd see too much more of that going forward. And I would call it more supply chain normalization than I would significant deflation. I think they're still challenged with a lot of inflationary operating costs that we all are. So I don't expect that they're going to be able to significantly reduce price. I think it's more holding than where it is right now that we're expecting and hoping for. But quite frankly, it wouldn't surprise me if inflation cause is even price increases going into the year."

            "name": "David Rush",
            "content": "Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'm proud of our full-year results. I'm proud of our full-year results, which demonstrate the strength of our broad product portfolio and continued execution by our team members. Despite a challenging operating environment in 2023, which saw significant reduction in single-family starts, we delivered resilient results. As promised, we delivered a double-digit EBITDA margin in the high teens along with robust free cash flow. We accomplished this through operational rigor and by closely partnering with our customers to help address their pain points through the use of our value-added solutions. Our results in 2023 further validate our strategy to be the easiest to do business with across the industry. I also want to thank everyone who participated both in person and virtually at our Investor Day in December, where we laid out the next leg of our growth journey. We're grateful for your ongoing support. As we begin 2024, we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We remain focused on profitable growth by leading with our value-added solutions, deploying our digital platform, and expanding in desirable markets through our proven M&A strategy. These initiatives, along with our commitment to efficient operations and disciplined capital deployment, will continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Our investments in value-added and digital solutions are driving clear market differentiation, delivering greater efficiency, and empowering the next generation of home building. By leveraging our scale in value-added products, we are able to help meet our customers' needs, such as reducing cycle times, addressing labor constraints, and improving home construction quality. As a proof point of our execution, I'm pleased that our service levels for on-time and in-full have continued to improve year-over-year. Our on-time delivery was 90% in 2023, while our in-full performance was 96%. With our investments in technology and automation, we'll keep working to drive these metrics higher. We remain committed to operational excellence and innovation to increase efficiency and create value. We have a robust set of operational and productivity initiatives and are focused on leveraging our scale and fixed costs while delivering the highest quality products to our customers. Our continuous improvement mindset employs technology, including our digital solutions and automation, to improve the construction process and drive greater discipline in our operations. As an important pillar of our strategy, we are focused on maintaining a fortress balance sheet. Our strong free cash flow provides financial flexibility and multiple high returning paths for capital deployment, enabling our clear set of priorities. We continued our robust buyback program in 2023, repurchasing nearly $1.8 billion of shares. I'm happy to announce that yesterday our board increased our share repurchase authorization to a total of $1 billion. We remain disciplined in our approach to tuck-in acquisitions and still have a long runway of targets in a fragmented market. Our focus areas for M&A include increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions, and enhancing customer stickiness. Let's turn to our full year highlights on slide 4. We delivered strong margins in 2023, including a robust 17% adjusted EBITDA margin that underscores our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Our resilient gross margin of more than 35% reflects stronger mix in value-added products, notably in our multifamily business, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. As we have communicated, we continue to see some normalization in core margins. We are also seeing multifamily normalized and expected to continue over the course of this year. Looking at slide 5, I want to highlight the over 30% improvement in our recordable incident rate in 2023, which is a remarkable achievement. At BFS, the safety of our team members is always our highest priority, and I am proud of the culture we have created to be a safer company every day. I am also excited to see the structural improvements we are making to remove excess costs and operate more efficiently. Our strong productivity savings of $175 million for 2023 reflect the hard work we are doing on targeted initiatives, and we expect another $100 million of productivity savings in 2024. Prudent SG&A expense management also remains a key focus area. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for cost reductions against future capacity demands. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending, and our team has responsibly managed cost in the short term while executing our strategy for the long term. As expected, we had a strong year in multifamily as prior year acquisitions were supercharged by a strong market. Multifamily remained a tailwind in Q4 as we worked through record backlogs. For single family, lower mortgage rates and low existing home inventories have helped us steady activity levels. National builder customers have done a good job of utilizing specs in conjunction with interest rate buy-downs to provide homebuyers with affordable options to purchase new homes. Our focus this year is on being the best partner to our customers by providing the highest quality customer service, driving our robust value-added solutions, and launching our BFS digital tools to make the building process faster, more efficient, and more affordable. Turning to M&A on slide 6, we continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In 2023, we completed seven deals with aggregate 2022 sales of roughly $540 million. Early in the fourth quarter, we acquired Standale Lumber, which gives us a strong presence in the growing Grand Rapids, Michigan market. Then in December, we acquired Encore Building Products, a leading building materials distributor that represents our entry into the Arkansas market and will serve as our platform for future growth in the state. And in early February, we acquired Quality Door and Millwork, a leading distributor of millwork doors and windows in Southern Idaho. We're excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. We also show how our M&A and organic investments increased value-added products as a percent of overall mix by 700 basis points over the past two years. Our success with this strategy has been a core component of our improved margin profile through the cycle. On slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we made two tuck-in acquisitions and repurchased over $200 million of shares while maintaining a strong balance sheet. And for all 2023, we prudently deployed approximately $2.5 billion in-line with our stated priorities. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $6.1 billion from 2022 through 2023, and we communicated a new goal at our investor day this past December to deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026. Now let's turn to slides eight and nine for an update on our digital strategy. We are establishing a differentiated position as the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space. Combined with our leading operating model and strong relationships, we believe BFS Digital Tools will be a substantial driver of growth for us and transformative for the industry. Our easy-to-use mybldr.com portal will seamlessly deliver our full digital capabilities to our customers. It is designed to create efficiencies for our team members and improve service for our customers by offering increased transparency and engagement in the home building process. Combined with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, our customers will have more control over the entire building process. This will save both time and money for both our customers and their clients while making the home building process more personalized. We are excited to showcase the full digital product capabilities at the International Builders Show next week. To drive the adoption of these innovative solutions, we have focused on training our sales and operations teams to help our customers leverage these powerful new tools. We are confident in our ability to deliver value from our digital solutions and meet our target of $200 million of incremental digital revenue by the end of this year and $1 billion by 2026 as we grow wallet share and new customers. Throughout the year, we acknowledge team members that go above and beyond. Rich Rapuzi, market manager in our Alaska market embodies these values like no other. I had the pleasure of spending time with Rich recently and witnessed the positive impact he has made on his team during his remarkable 50-year career at BFS and Legacy companies. Rich's journey started as a customer service rep in 1974 and is rooted in hands-on experience and continuous learning. Through his career, Rich established vital departments and assumed multiple leadership roles. What truly sets Rich apart is his passion for his community and mentoring others. His colleagues will tell you that he deeply cares about helping people reach their potential. As Rich prepares for retirement later this year, his impact will endure through the lives he has touched. While he'll be greatly missed, his legacy will resonate within our organization for years to come. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Thanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we are focused on executing our strategic pillars. This focus, along with our close partnership with our customers to address their pain points is a competitive differentiator in our industry. We are the unquestioned leader in value-added solutions, which we believe are the most effective way to address labor and cycle time challenges. Our industry-leading digital innovations are bringing greater efficiency to homebuilding and will win us new customers and grow wallet share along the way. Our robust free cash flow generation is funding a disciplined capital deployment strategy that will compound long-term shareholder value. While 2023 was an exciting year, we are just getting started. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. I would just add, Matt, that conversations with customers are almost uniformly optimistic for the year. There are differences in when they believe that timing of that rebound will start, and that's all obviously driven by the macro environment to a degree. And the digital ad that we'll experience during the year will be more like a hockey stick. It will be weighted to the back half of the year as we continue to drive adoption and training throughout the organization and with our customers. But we're excited about the year as a whole. It's a little more difficult to pinpoint the exact point in time when we start seeing it in real time. But the long-term demand still is very, very encouraging. And I would tell you, you're exactly right; our sales teams that have focused on the larger projects partly because their customers are also looking for opportunities in the smaller projects that still qualified technically as multifamily or light commercial. We're all focused on those opportunities and those will help us bridge that headwind a little easier for the rest of the year. But it still takes a little bit of time for those projects to get out of the ground. And the timing of that makes it a little difficult, but only focused on that opportunity. I mean, lumber and truss go hand-in-hand together, but value-added is more than truss. I think that's the thing you get from the mind. So value added is later in the process. And what I would add is our belief in the resilience of that range and the fact that we can hold within that range is our belief in our value-added product portfolio and solutions. Those are the products that are more valuable to our customers and as a result, more have a better margin opportunity for us. And as we continue to grow that as a percentage of our overall sales is always going to help that gross margin number be more resilient. I would just add, remember, it's only 13% of our overall business. The other thing I would add is we were at the Harvard Housing Conference, and there were multifamily players there. And it's a cost of capital challenge in addition to all of the multifamily that had been constructed over the last 12 to 18 months is coming to market all at the same time. So there's a little bit of a digestion of that in addition to solving the capital cost equation. But again, just like in single-family, the long-term outlook for multifamily is very positive when you look at the demand curve and what people need housing and what multifamily satisfies for that population. So long term, we're still very positive on the business. And we do know we'll have to manage some of the cost -- the capital challenges at or there today. But again, 13% of our business. I would tell you the other differentiation we have is not just adding locations, it's actually improving the throughput of the locations we already own. We've invested over $100 million in existing plants. Over 65% of our tables have some level of automation. Every plant has some level of automation. So there's a lot of different ways we can extend our lead without building physical plant to do so, and we're focused on that as well. I would just add from a customer sentiment perspective, the national biller, customers are seeing increased foot traffic. And more importantly, the foot traffic that they are seeing are more apt to actually buy a home. So the percentage of closings to people looking, I feel like is gaining traction and their ability to match up available inventory and monthly mortgage payment to demand is -- they've done a great job with that. Now where we need a little help from the Fed mortgage rates would be to get the non-national builder customer in an arena where the cost of the mortgage is helping to drive that demand to them. So that less so, but we expect that to be what is the first off the sidelines when we get that movement, but the national builders have done a good job in the existing environment. Also, I think, taken advantage of capacity availability to lean into it as well, and that's a different component than others might have."

        "content": "Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Builders FirstSource Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.\nHeather Kos: Good morning. And welcome to our third quarter earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Rush: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Before we begin, I want to formally welcome Heather to the Builders FirstSource team. We are excited to have someone with her deep knowledge and decades of experience leading Investor Relations, which is a critical function here. Heather, welcome. Now on to our Q3 performance. Despite industry volatility caused by macroeconomic headwinds, our resilient third quarter results reflect the strength of our value-added portfolio, broad footprint and operational initiatives we have put in place over the past several years. While challenges remain due to inflation and increasing mortgage rates, we continue to generate healthy margins. This is proof of our attractive product mix and the benefits of our investments in multifamily. We remain confident in our 2023 outlook, as we focus on being the best partner for our customers and executing our strategy to drive long-term growth. We continue to create robust free cash flow and invest in the business to operate more efficiently, increase customer loyalty and expand our footprint. We are committed to operational excellence, including capturing efficiencies in our supply chain, as well as investing in automation and process improvements. These efforts are driving productivity savings and helping address our customers\u2019 labor challenges now and into the future. We are helping our customers reduce cycle times, which is highlighted by improving our in-full deliveries from 94% last year to 96% during the third quarter. On-time and in-full deliveries ensure our customers have the right material at the right time, building their loyalty and trust in us. We are continuing our investments in value-added solutions organically and through M&A to help our customers build more efficiently. These accretive acquisitions have enhanced our value-added product coverage and helped us achieve a leading position in desirable markets. As we grow share in these higher margin products, we are driving mixed improvement across the business. Our strong free cash flow provides multiple paths for capital deployment, all towards creating shareholder value. Given the long runway of potential tuck-ins, we will remain acquisitive to bolster our growth potential, while maintaining a disciplined focus on the highest return opportunities. Looking at our third quarter highlights on slide four, gross margin was approximately 35% and only down slightly on a sequential basis. Despite normalization in core margins, our overall margins have remained resilient, primarily due to stronger mix in value-added products, including our multifamily business and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Our adjusted EBITDA margin also remains strong, highlighting our ability to manage our operations effectively in a challenging and dynamic environment. This execution is a reflection of our talented and focused field leadership team. Turning to slide five, we generated strong productivity savings of $54 million during the quarter. This reflects the effectiveness of our BFS One Team Operating System, which delivers value across the business by building people, excellence and growth. Our recent acquisitions in multifamily contributed an increase of 2% in sales and 4% in EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter. Multifamily remained a tailwind this quarter and we expect this strength to continue for the remainder of 2023 before declining around the second quarter of next year. Disciplined SG&A expense management remains a key focus area. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for cost reductions against future capacity needs. We are focused on our discretionary spending and our team has responsibly managed cost in the short-term, while executing our strategy for the long-term. Regarding our industry, the national builders have reported resilient results by providing incentives such as interest rate buydowns to ease affordability challenges and attract prospective buyers. The limited inventory of existing homes for sale is also steering traffic to new construction. As we look forward to 2024, we will maintain our best-in-class customer service, continue our emphasis on expanding our value-added product mix and launch our BFS digital tool to make building process faster, more efficient and more affordable. Turning to M&A on slide six, we continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. Through the third quarter, we have completed five deals with aggregate prior year sales of roughly $350 million. In September, we acquired Frank\u2019s Cash & Carry, a leading building material distributor with trust manufacturing in the Florida Panhandle. We are pleased that this acquisition will help us grow with builders in the area. And earlier in the third quarter, we acquired Church\u2019s Lumber, which expanded our presence in the Detroit market. We\u2019re excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. As shown on slide six, our M&A and organic investments have substantially increased our value-added product mix and diversified our end markets. We have seen the fruit of this growth in recent quarters through higher gross margins, even in a down housing market. Moving to slide seven, I would like to provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter, we prudently deployed capital in line with our stated priorities. We made two tuck-in acquisitions and repurchased over $200 million of shares, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $5.7 billion since the end of 2021 and remain on track to achieve our 2025 goal of deploying $7 billion to $10 billion of capital, as communicated our Investor Day in December 2021. Now let\u2019s turn to slide eight and nine for an update on our digital strategy. We are steadfast in our commitment to leading the digital evolution in our industry and generating new innovations to drive greater efficiency across home building and enhance our product and service offerings. As we look forward to our full product launch in Q1, we have made it a priority to drive digital adoption across our operations. myBLDR.com is designed to create efficiencies for both our team members and customers by offering improved transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. Taking with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, this gives our customers more control over the entire building process, saving both time and money for our customers and their clients, while making the homebuilding process more personalized. In the third quarter, we continued our product development and adoption efforts as we prepare for the upcoming full product launch. These are important milestones in our journey to reshape the industry and extend our lead as the partner of choice in the market and attain our goal of $1 billion in incremental sales by 2026. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our Investor Day next month. At BFS, we pride ourselves on helping our people achieve their career goals. A team member who has taken full advantage of every growth opportunity presented to her is Sue Dean, the General Manager of our Florence, South Carolina location. Through the various roles she\u2019s held over her more than 40 years with BFS, she\u2019s earned the nickname Sue Deany for her ability to solve problems and make magic happen. Since being promoted as General Manager, Sue has led her location to achieve exceptional results by recognizing her team members\u2019 potential and empowering them. It\u2019s stories like Sue\u2019s that made me excited to see all the different ways our team members can grow here at BFS. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our third quarter financial result in greater detail.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our operating model in the face of macro volatility. We are maintaining a healthy balance sheet and prudently deploying capital to the highest return opportunities, which included share repurchases during the quarter. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and value creation for our shareholders. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I\u2019ll recap our third quarter results. Second, I\u2019ll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I\u2019ll discuss our full year 2023 guidance and 2024 scenarios. Let\u2019s begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on slides 10 and 11. We delivered $4.5 billion in net sales. For organic sales decreased by 14%, driven by a 19% decline in single-family due to slower demand over the prior year, supply chain normalization and commodity deflation of approximately 9%. Multifamily grew by over 6%, driven by our recent acquisitions, as well as favorable margins, largely attributable to the longer lead time for this end market. R&R and other grew by over 1% amid increased sales focus and capacity versus the prior year. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to net sales. Importantly, value-added products represented 51% of our net sales this quarter, increasing 6 percentage points since Investor Day in Q4 2021. This reflects our position as the supplier of choice for these higher margin products. During the third quarter, gross profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 22% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 34.9%, decreasing 10 basis points due to normalization in core organic gross margins, offset by roughly 125 basis points of our previously discussed multifamily over earning. SG&A decreased $61 million to $940 million, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year and inflation. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $34 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 330 basis points to 20.7%, primarily attributable to decreased fixed cost leverage from lower sales. We remain focused on operating efficiently, containing costs and effectively integrating acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $813 million, down 31%, primarily driven by lower net sales due to a weaker housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained a robust 17.9%, up 90 basis points sequentially as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income of $534 million was down $280 million from the prior year quarter. The 34% decrease was largely due to lower net sales. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.24, down 19%, compared to $5.20 in the prior year period. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.83 per share. Now let\u2019s turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on slide 12. Our third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $665 million, down $835 million, compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a weaker housing market. Capital expenditures were $128 million. All in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $538 million. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30th, our free cash flow yield was 14.1%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 32%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1 times, while base business leverage was 1.5 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.1 billion, consisting of $1 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $100 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for $224 million at an average stock price of $136.22 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased nearly $1.6 billion of shares at an average price of $97.43 per share. We have approximately $400 million remaining on our most recent $1 billion share repurchase program, approved in April of 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation through a proven ability to deploy capital and deliver high returns. Now let\u2019s turn to our outlook on slide 13. Given affordability headwinds, our Q3 sales were a little softer than expected. However, the October sales trend was seasonally healthy, and our focus -- our continued focus and execution gives us confidence that we will achieve our full year base business and total company EBITDA guidance for 2023 that we outlined in our second quarter earnings call. For full year 2023, we expect total company net sales to be $16.8 billion to $17.1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 15.8% to 16.7%. We are guiding gross margins to a range of 34% to 35%. Our recent above-normal margins reflect a greater mix of value-added products, along with disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs. As we move through the end of the year, we expect both our gross margins and the multifamily business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2023 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $425. Our 2023 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and slide 14 of the investor presentation for a full list of these assumptions. Turning to slides 15 and 16, as a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clear -- to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales is $16.4 billion. Our base business EBITDA guide is $2.2 billion at a margin of 13.5%. Moving to slide 17, we recognize that 2024 is coming into focus as we approach year end. Like we did earlier this year, we have laid out a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions. I want to emphasize that this is not full year guidance for 2024, but these scenarios should help clarify our range of performance expectations for 2024 and demonstrate the strength of our best-in-class operating platform. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create value in any environment to support profitable growth. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.\nDave Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we\u2019re executing on our strategic pillars to deliver long-term value creation. Our tireless team effort has resulted in a differentiated platform, setting us up for above market growth and exceptional profitability for years to come. I continue to be proud of our operational excellence, which is driving increased safety, productivity and profitability despite market headwinds. We are in a great position today and as end markets further stabilize, we are positioned for an even stronger future. We\u2019ll remain at the forefront of technology with our BFS digital tool, which I\u2019m confident will be a game-changer for the industry. We are exceptionally well-positioned in the marketplace to navigate complex operating environments due to our value-added solutions, fortress balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation. We\u2019re excited to share more details about our longer term vision at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5th in Atlanta and look forward to seeing you there. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let\u2019s please open the call now for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. I think it\u2019s very helpful that you outlined those 2024 framework assumptions here, especially as you look ahead to the Investor Day, perhaps, precluding some of that line of questioning so you can focus a bit more the longer term. So my questions will focus on that. I think I see in the footnote that you are making assumptions about multifamily and R&R into 2024. I think, Dave, earlier you made a very specific comment that multifamily could turn in the second quarter of next year. So my question is, how is multifamily contemplated from both a growth and margin perspective in that 2024 framework? Thanks, guys.\nDave Rush: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate the question. As you know, the multifamily projects have a longer life cycle, tend to be 19 months to 18 months. So what we\u2019re seeing in the backlog right now is healthy and will carry us through the first quarter of next year. What\u2019s changing, the dynamic that\u2019s changing a bit is the projects, the new projects are slower to come to market. We believe there\u2019s going to be a pause in some of the multifamily as the market digests what\u2019s coming, what\u2019s completing throughout this year and as they figure out the right balance between cost of capital and rents and what return they can get on the rents, we just think there\u2019s going to be a temporary pause and then things will start up again at the tail end of 2024. But again, because there\u2019s such a long cycle for those projects to get into the ground, we won\u2019t necessarily see that effect in 2024. So we\u2019re forecasting for multifamily to be off in 2024 as a result.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. Just to add to it. I think it\u2019s the theme of normalization. We\u2019ve seen such displacement in the industry over the last couple of years, multifamily included. You\u2019re going to see that theme, I think, in a lot of what we\u2019re talking about. Things are going well, but certainly normalizing back from some of that displacement.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that, guys. Very helpful. And then second one, the -- I\u2019m sticking on the framework here. On the single-family side, I guess, it\u2019s two parter. Number one, the low end of a down 4%, just given where interest rates are and a lot of the questions out there, the question is effectively why not outline a lower end? And in that scenario of a lower end, would you be able to kind of push any harder on cost out? So that\u2019s kind of part one of the question. And then part two is just, given the sort of mid-teens EBITDA margin you\u2019re guiding to, I guess, what is the sort of implied gross margin in that? I know there\u2019s a lot in there, but thanks, guys.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. So, I think, a couple of factors. The first is that we harvested the feedback from the economists. That\u2019s generally what we lean on, just like everybody else when it comes to the expectations for next year. We certainly try and temper it a little bit by, let\u2019s say, eliminating as statisticians do the high and the low end or the ones that look ridiculous in terms of trying to come up with a real number. Up until very recently, I would tell you that the sense was that we would see some nice growth next year. Admittedly, some of the more recent revisions from the economists have pulled it back, but I still think it\u2019s fairly favorable. So, what will play out?\nMatthew Bouley: Sure.\nPeter Jackson: That\u2019s a fair -- it\u2019s a fair comment. Really, the reason why we gave the range that we did is we think there are a number of scenarios that could play out. If you want to go below the low end of this, I love the question because I think what you didn\u2019t ask is as informative as anything and that\u2019s nobody\u2019s challenging our double-digit margins, even when the market\u2019s down. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve demonstrated an ability to maintain those margins, to see healthy profitability, to benefit from the mix of our business and we expect to continue to be able to do that. Now, we\u2019ll certainly retain our discipline around costs. We\u2019ll continue to resize facilities and markets, depending on what the starts number is and what the business looks like. But I think our theme around here is really about consistent performance and operational excellence and not really seeing a huge need to do something unwise for the business, but just keep doing what we\u2019re doing because we\u2019re seeing great results.\nDave Rush: And just to add, Matt, it\u2019s continued to drive costs out of the business that don\u2019t add value, the benefit of our platform and the fact that we\u2019ve done the hard work in the last two years to integrate these companies. We have a 30-year average experience with our field leadership group. They know what to do, when to do it and how to manage those costs effectively to maximize whatever is presented to us. And we\u2019ve identified a lot of opportunities to continue to focus on productivity and where we are now is we don\u2019t have to keep reinventing those opportunities because our scale allows us to push that across the platform and we have plenty of runway to take existing ideas in the markets that we haven\u2019t been able to push those ideas yet just because of our scale and find -- keep finding dollars to save.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. And on my question, did you have anything around the gross margin expectation within that mid-teens EBITDA guide?\nPeter Jackson: We won\u2019t give anything specific, but I think it\u2019s fair to say we do expect to see normalization into 2024, that pullback, the reversal of the multifamily in particular. But overall, that normalization theme, I think, applies to margins as well.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Appreciate the very comprehensive answers, guys. See you in Atlanta in a month. Thank you.\nDave Rush: Thanks, Matt.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Rush: Hi.\nTrey Grooms: So first question, Peter, you mentioned that October trends were, I think, you used the word healthy. Can you go through maybe some more detail on 4Q, kind of what you\u2019re seeing thus far and maybe what kind of looking into your single-family assumption that you\u2019re baking in here for the 4Q guide?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. I can get started. I\u2019m sure Dave will have a commentary as well. But the year has been a good year, right? We had that big reset at the beginning when the builders decided where their new rates would be, and it\u2019s been very stable. I think we did expect there to be a little bit more volume in the third quarter. We thought there\u2019d be a little bit of a push. Certainly the commentary from the large nationals was very strong and for a variety of reasons, whether it be tone or weather or whatever the factors were, it just wasn\u2019t as good as we expected. Our performance was still quite good. We\u2019re certainly pleased with our profitability. But as we look at the way the year has played out into the fourth quarter, it\u2019s still healthy. The strength of the business continues and we\u2019re pleased with that ability to continue to see good flow through on the sales side, despite some of the headlines that sort of have gotten everybody so concerned.\nDave Rush: Yeah. The only thing I\u2019d add is the national builders continue to be stable, right? I\u2019m not saying that they\u2019re expecting substantial robust growth, but they\u2019re definitely still going forward with the plans that they\u2019ve communicated to us. Their ability to use interest rate buy downs and get a prospective buyer into a monthly payment they can afford is working. They\u2019re basically using that methodology to get a payment and then go from the payment to a selection of house based on that payment and that\u2019s working. So that\u2019s encouraging for the fourth quarter at least to stay at a stable rate and really only be affected by seasonality.\nTrey Grooms: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then, the full digital rollout coming up soon, any color on how that plays into your scenario analysis for next year that you rolled out?\nPeter Jackson: It\u2019s pretty modest in the first year. It\u2019s in the hundreds of millions of sales, but we\u2019ve certainly got a lot of focus in the organization on the initial adoption, the communication and getting it into the hands of both our side of our sales people and leadership, as well as our customers. But so far, the feedback\u2019s been great. We\u2019re really pleased with the tools and the development successes. We\u2019re meeting milestones and feeling really good about the product that we\u2019re going to have to show the market and we\u2019re excited that the market\u2019s going to be able to benefit from the tools to improve efficiency and take costs out.\nDave Rush: The development is right on track. We had a preview this week, in fact, of some of the features and that continued to be wowed by our development team. But it\u2019s changed, it\u2019s not only changed for the customers we\u2019re going to introduce it to, but it\u2019s changed for our people. And we want to make sure we do this the right way, the prudent way, methodically, making sure the adoption goes the way we want, because we really only get one bite at this apple. And we want to make sure that what we do is the best way for us to ensure success. But what we\u2019re showing people, you\u2019re going to be impressed by. I can\u2019t wait for you guys to see it when you get to it live.\nTrey Grooms: Okay. Looking forward to it. Thanks for taking my questions and keep up the good work. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Trey.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Thanks, everybody. Quickly on the 2024 scenarios, I\u2019m just wondering if you could add some context on the revenue assumptions here, because if you take the single-family starts numbers and kind of take that on your base business revenue, your output on sales would be much higher than that and I get there\u2019s other things in there. You\u2019re giving the commodity assumptions, though, and I don\u2019t think M&A is that significant carryover into next year and you\u2019re talking about multifamily down. So what I guess I\u2019m getting to is there seems to be sort of like a mid-single-digit type outperformance to the starts volume. Wondering if you could just touch on whether you think that\u2019s actual price or if you\u2019re baking in some outperformance versus that volume?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. Yeah. I guess the short answer is we are expecting some outperformance. But if I just could re-baseline on the key components. Single-family up, multifamily down on the normalization. The two big drivers there, obviously, continued normalization in both the sales and the margins in those displaced areas. Multifamily, those categories where we saw some out-earning, that\u2019s certainly happening. But we are confident in our ability to take share and see growth based on what we\u2019ve been able to deliver and the investments we\u2019ve made.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: That\u2019s great. Very encouraging. And then you mentioned sort of getting these ranges from economists\u2019 discussions. What about your discussions for 2024 with the large builders and even small and regional builders? And then just wondering if you could touch on any differences in outlook between those two groups into next year?\nDave Rush: Well, the smaller builders don\u2019t have the access to rate buydowns that the larger builders have had and that\u2019s really the main differentiating factor. Interestingly enough, it\u2019s a small percentage of the total market, but there\u2019s a marked increase in cash buyers, which is a big part of what\u2019s going to keep the smaller guys going as well. I think it\u2019s still, the word is, I would use it stable. Again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be robust from a standpoint of every -- all the macroeconomic uncertainty getting resolved. But the demand is clearly there. I mean, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s carried us through with all the headwinds that we\u2019ve faced as an industry in the last six months. The -- I think it\u2019s been a ultimate proof point that the long-term demand is there. So as far -- as long as we can keep that affordability equation in check, I think that it\u2019ll be a stable environment and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing from our larger customers.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Very good. Thanks a lot, everyone.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you for the question on the actual quarter. The value-added products saw pressure with the rest of the market, didn\u2019t really outperform the company average as much as normal. I\u2019m just wondering about specifically in the quarter, what was going on there and what the next couple of quarters you think looks like in those products?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. No. That\u2019s a good question, Keith. One of the things that obviously drew my attention was that number this quarter and making sure that we understood exactly what was going on in the business. I\u2019ll start by saying, we feel very good about the number. It has performed better than expected versus the starts over the last year and it\u2019s given us confidence that both the volume and the margins are real and sustainable. What you\u2019re seeing in the comps, though, is that last year when the thing -- when the market, when single-family starts really started to turn down, we saw a massive and meaningful impact on the lumber and lumber sheet goods, right, the core commodity component of our business. That turned down quick, but at the same time, we were still seeing growth in our value-added categories. The manufacturer product, window stores and millwork, all still growing as we were working through all that backlog, right? The extended cycle times by the builders, the lack of product by the vendors, that was clearing. So that was a dynamic last year. This year, we\u2019re lapping that. And so what we\u2019ve seen is that, well, statistically or on a percentage basis a bit weaker than some of the other categories and looking worse on average. It\u2019s actually in line. It\u2019s just a little bit of timing in terms of the year-over-year. So, still feel good about it, still investing, still seeing the benefits, both on the profitability and the revenue line, but a little bit of comp issue.\nDave Rush: I would just add that, the thing I pay attention to is what\u2019s the average backlog in our plants today? Very healthy, three-week to four-week backlog. That\u2019s where we want to be because we want to be at that level of customer service as well. We\u2019re seeing that still stay steady and healthy.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you. One other question on the price deflation in the quarter. Is that all lumber or are there any other products where you\u2019re seeing prices deflating year-to-year?\nPeter Jackson: I\u2019d say in general, it\u2019s across the Board. We\u2019ve talked a lot about inflation and some of the impacts there. Some of that has pulled back. We\u2019ve seen certain categories pull back. We\u2019ve seen the competition increase and some of those margins erode. Clearly, the bulk of it, the vast majority of it is on the commodity components, but we\u2019ve seen a little bit elsewhere, probably value add, no, not probably, value add the least in terms of margin normalization, but across the Board, I think it\u2019s fair to say.\nKeith Hughes: Okay.\nDave Rush: Yeah. Were you asking about price or our costs from vendors?\nKeith Hughes: I was -- well, really both. I mean, just in general, between both coming in and out of the warehouse, besides lumber, are there any specific products that you would call out that\u2019s seeing more deflation than others?\nPeter Jackson: I think we\u2019ve talked about it in prior quarters, there are a couple of categories that we\u2019ve seen make some moves, probably, the better, the most obvious example is after commodities is engineered lumber. They had some pretty substantial price increases and have given a portion of that back. I would say in general, though, it\u2019s been fairly modest.\nKeith Hughes: Okay.\nPeter Jackson: Good news is there have been cost increases for the most part that\u2019s leveled out. We\u2019re back to a regular, normal increase for cost of inflation and that\u2019s it.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nDave Rush: Thanks, Keith.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies.\nCollin Verron: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I appreciate the color in single-family and multifamily. I was just hoping you can walk us through how you\u2019re thinking about the R&R end market in the potential 2024 scenarios, kind of what informs your assumptions around those markets and maybe how the R&R business stacks up from a margin or product mix perspective?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. I mean, R&R is fairly small for us, as you know. In that 20% of the business range, it\u2019s inclusive of our retail and commercial categories. So that\u2019s -- there\u2019s a lot in there. In general, what we\u2019ve seen is that we\u2019ve had a bit more capacity available as the overall market has slowed and that\u2019s allowed us to focus in and we\u2019ve had some success. So while there have been, we see it as well, some headlines out of the economists that the investment side on the R&R might be pressured, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about what we\u2019ve seen so far and our ability to fill available capacity by just offering our better services and product portfolio and expertise to categories of customers who want it but haven\u2019t been able to get access to it.\nCollin Verron: Great. That\u2019s a helpful color. And then on the gross margin side, I think in the quarter it held up better than I think your previous guide would have implied. Can you just walk us through why margins were more resilient this quarter than you anticipated and maybe help us think about the step down in margins and how quickly you think that that could happen to get to that longer term guide that you\u2019ve put out there?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. No. That\u2019s the million-dollar question, Collin. You\u2019re absolutely right. We continue to wrestle with this. We continue to see the trends of that normalization, right? The share that we took, that we took a lot of and given back a little bit of it. The price that we took and we took a lot of and given back a little bit of it. It has played out, but I think it\u2019s been slower than we\u2019ve anticipated. This quarter we did see a fair amount of what we expected. I think where the beat came, at least in my mind, was some of the timing around some of the rebates, some of the productivity, some of the favorable tailwinds and some of the product mix, which is a little better than expected. Not massive, but it accumulated into a number that was a healthy beat on the margin line, to your point, expected.\nDave Rush: The only thing I\u2019d add is, we have a focus on using our scale to leverage our supply chain opportunities better, get a lower landed cost, more direct sourcing. Those come in little bits. We get a bite here on a product, a bite there on a product, but over time they start adding up. That along with the investments we\u2019ve made in the manufacturing, automation and the efficiencies gained there, again, a little bit at a time, but then you look back at six months of doing it and it\u2019s actually a meaningful number. Those things we\u2019re starting to be able to track and see actually help.\nCollin Verron: Great. I appreciate the call and good luck going forward.\nDave Rush: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey guys. You mentioned the multifamily declines that you\u2019re expecting in the second quarter of next year. Do you expect that business to normalize from a margin perspective in 2024 at this point? I know it\u2019s been a bit of a tailwind.\nPeter Jackson: We do. Yeah. We think those things are kind of hand in glove, both the volumes and then the resulting margins as competition levels a little bit.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.\nDave Rush: Hi, Kurt.\nKurt Yinger: Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Hey. I just wanted to stick on the gross margin line and I guess if you were to kind of peel back some of the multifamily benefits, I mean, how would you kind of characterize where that core gross margin stands versus where you would expect normalized to be and what stage of that normalization process are we in, because we\u2019ve talked about it in a long time. It seems like over the last several quarters, it started to materialize, but the tail of how that stretches into next year also seems pretty long. So just love to hear your thoughts there?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. So there\u2019s a couple of different pieces, right? If you stipulate, which I think you have, that we\u2019ve set multifamily aside for all the reasons we\u2019ve already talked about, I think the storyline on single-family is that we\u2019ve seen the bulk of the margin normalization in the core products. There\u2019s more to go, but I think we\u2019ve seen the bulk of it. If you look at subcategories quarter-over-quarter, so Q3 2023 to Q3 2022, you\u2019re talking mid-single digits percentages of margin that we\u2019ve given back in the commodity space. We\u2019ve given back price and margin in every one of the categories. So that normalization that we\u2019ve been talking about, we\u2019ve been digesting it and we\u2019ve been processing it. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re done. I think when we look at the numbers, we see the trends in certain categories and markets, there\u2019s probably another leg there, but it\u2019s far smaller than the first leg. So we\u2019re in the sixth, seventh inning here. We\u2019re not in the second inning. That said, there\u2019s certainly every quarter timing and things that come through in terms of, like Dave said, when we see benefits, when we see the timing on certain rebates, that sort of thing and multifamily is not to be minimized, right? It\u2019s been a big deal for us this year and we do think it will normalize into next year.\nKurt Yinger: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just on the technology front, I\u2019m curious with some of the pilots that you\u2019ve had, what are some of the most promising offerings within that where you\u2019ve seen particular traction and maybe some of the big learnings that you\u2019ve taken away from these programs that you\u2019ll look to implement or change on the full scale launch early next year?\nDave Rush: Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. I would tell you, understand the pilots are not for learning how to implement. It\u2019s for learning how to develop. So what we\u2019ve used the pilots for is get the product where we want it to get. Having said that, one of the favorite modules of the folks that are engaged is the one that you can take and put all the plans for HVAC, framing, plumbing, all into a module and it shows where those trades potentially would collide with each other and resolve that collision before it goes live into the field and that is the one that particularly builders think gives them the biggest and quickest return from savings, because it minimizes the mistakes that you would have to learn on the fly in the field and you get ahead of them. So that\u2019s probably the one that we get the most positive feedback on. But what we\u2019re really trying to do is get everything resolved from a customer perspective on the front end so when we go to a full product launch, they\u2019ll already have solved the problems that they\u2019re counting on us solving.\nPeter Jackson: Maybe the best example of that that Dave was just referring to is the shoppable digital twin. So that has been a core aspect of this, right? You\u2019re taking the plan, you\u2019re putting it into that three-dimensional environment and the real bang for the buck is the shopability. They want to be able to pick up a siding or a roofing or whatever and see it on the rendering, have it be impacted with the real design, be able to quote it and shop it and buy it. And that entire experience, as you might imagine, is quite complex, right? It\u2019s challenging both technically and from a UI/UX user interface, user experience type of dynamic. So what we\u2019ve been really focused on this summer is putting our product in front of them, right, as it stands, getting the feedback of how it works, how they\u2019re actually going to transact and interact with that tool and making the tweaks behind the scenes to really drive the technology and the functionality to meet that need state head-on. And so when Dave talks about development and using the feedback from customers on development, that\u2019s a really big one for us and super excited about what the teams are coming up with. We got to see some pilot stuff recently or some demo stuff recently. I agree with Dave. You all are going to like it.\nKurt Yinger: All right. Good to hear. Well, appreciate the color and good luck here in Q4, guys.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Kurt.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Quinn Fredrickson with Baird.\nQuinn Fredrickson: Hey. Good morning. Just curious on the fiscal 2024 scenarios in terms of the high end versus the low end. Is the swing factor there just really rates or anything else we should be thinking about there?\nPeter Jackson: No question, affordability rates in particular are in focus for us in terms of trying to predict that starts number. It\u2019s an interesting balance, though. We\u2019ve continued to see very healthy, very stable, as Dave referred to sales and production through the industry. But that question of is there a magic number of mortgage rates that really puts a step down type of impact on this industry is in everybody\u2019s minds. So far, no. But we\u2019re certainly keeping a close eye on it and really what you\u2019re seeing here, and I was trying to highlight it a little bit before, these are different ranges that we\u2019ve seen from economists. We think this encompasses what we saw from all the economists that we were gathering in the last month or two. So, certainly, we\u2019ll continue to dial this in. We\u2019ll continue to update it based on what we\u2019re seeing. But that\u2019s kind of the context in which we came up with it.\nDave Rush: Yeah. The only thing I\u2019d add is, keep in mind we\u2019re talking the full year, right? We\u2019re not sure if we might have some more macro headwinds in the beginning of the year and at ease as the year goes on. But who knows? And what we hear more often than not, though, is the back half would probably be slightly better than the front half in that scenario.\nPeter Jackson: We\u2019re ready regardless and I think that\u2019s kind of our outline here with the scenarios is we\u2019ve got a high performing business. We\u2019re going to deliver really favorable positive numbers regardless of which way this goes. So, we didn\u2019t want to hesitate to put this out there for people to contemplate because sometimes the skepticism or the fear in the marketplace can become a little more than what\u2019s appropriate.\nQuinn Fredrickson: Okay. Thank you. And then on the productivity side, is there a certain target baked into these scenarios or is it kind of the typical 3% to 5% kind of productivity savings that you talked about at the Investor Day? Thanks.\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. So I\u2019m glad you asked that question, because I do want to differentiate between a couple of things. First of all, the 3% to 5% is our goal internally. So please do not ever load that into your numbers, because I don\u2019t want to steer you the wrong direction. In terms of what we\u2019ve been able to do, it certainly gets harder, right? I mean, you talk about it being the first couple of years of being harvesting the low-hanging fruit. We have a tremendous opportunity to continue to deliver productivity savings, but I think those savings become a bit more challenging, a bit more programmatic over time. So I think a moderating of the annual number is appropriate, but we intend to continue to deliver on that over time and that will be an important part of our discussion in December as well.\nDave Rush: Well, what I can say definitively, it\u2019s embedded in our culture now. I mean, we have everybody in the field at all points. We offer incentives for any employee to come up with an idea and submit it and if it\u2019s an idea that we can use to cultivate savings from, we reward that employee for that idea. So, it is embedded in our culture. We have leaders from the field come together every year to set targets, set goals and try to identify initiatives that will be the primary focus. And what I\u2019m proud about is our ability to consistently deliver savings each year.\nQuinn Fredrickson: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Dave, Peter, I want to stick with multifamily and I guess kind of challenge the phrasing and framing of a pause that then is resolved by the end of next year. I think the industry participants we talked to are starting to talk about numbers that are significantly greater, declines of 30%, 40% and starts next year and no rebound and potentially even further declines in 2025. So what specifically are you embedding for multifamily and who are you talking to? Is this kind of high level economist like you\u2019ve alluded to or industry participants in multifamily informing that view? That\u2019s kind of part one. And part two has been maybe as a follow-up. Just remind us, how much of your business in multifamily is more tied to starts versus maybe mid to later in the construction cycle there?\nDave Rush: Well, the only thing, I guess, I want to clarify, Paul is, Paul\u2019s being from a standpoint of even planning for, embedding out and trying to get a project underway, it doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to when we would see sales from a new project because of the 19 months to 18 months of duration. But, so we\u2019re definitely anticipating a slowdown in multifamily. Peter?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. Yeah. So, I guess, the comments I\u2019d make when we talked about a bounce back in a couple of different scenarios, Dave did refer to it a multifamily, we talked a little bit about on single-family. So, I want to make sure we separate those two for starters. Multifamily, we don\u2019t know when the pause is. There\u2019s no question in our minds, downside is coming, right? We can see that because we\u2019re selling into the middle of next year already and we\u2019re seeing the declines in quotes and bids and so on. Now, the one thing I also want to be real careful of is, we don\u2019t sell into high rises or some of the other urban environment. That\u2019s not really our play for the most part, right? Where five-story and below would frame multifamily structures, which we do think is going to be a more responsive to the housing needs that we see in the U.S. market in this day and age, and some of the other dynamics that we think are favorable to that. But your comments are accurate in terms of what we\u2019re seeing. There is certainly pessimism, the higher rates have made deals and projects more difficult to pencil out and we have seen a downturn. I would say at this stage, we\u2019re not seeing the numbers you\u2019ve been teeing up there. Is it possible? Sure. Wouldn\u2019t out -- wouldn\u2019t rule out it going anywhere. For us, though, I think our ability to do a couple of things. One is to, to scale our facilities, change shifts. But also the second thing is to rebalance where we put our load from a value-added products perspective. We can certainly move single-family to multifamily and vice versa, which we\u2019ve been doing recently. So we\u2019ll continue to do that and ensure that we\u2019re protecting this franchise because we absolutely believe in multifamily in the long run, even if there\u2019s some cyclicality in the near-term. To your second question, which is the ratio of that multifamily business and what it is weighted towards. I would say that it\u2019s probably 80% weighted towards the start and more 20% weighted towards the completion, just directionally and that\u2019s because the bulk of it is trust and upfront product with a bit of it being related to millwork, which is a little closer to the completion, not at the completion, but a bit closer with that.\nDave Rush: Yeah. The only thing I\u2019d add is and why I use the term pause versus halt, is just the underlying housing demand need. I mean, if they can\u2019t get into single-family because of affordability concerns, multifamily is the next best option. And I think it will be relatively quick for the rent factor to be figured out to where we get to a rental number that\u2019s cheaper than a mortgage, maybe more than we wanted to pay, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s the best chance I\u2019ve got to get my own place. So maybe pause is too optimistic, but it\u2019s something that I hold because of the overall demand that we see out there.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Yeah. I mean, now that last point, we certainly agree with. I think it\u2019s just a question of kind of the financing mechanics and other things in terms of what\u2019s going to dictate kind of depth and duration there. And then the five-story and below is probably an important distinction too. My second question or follow-up, which is also related on the margin side. So setting aside the over-earning that you\u2019ve covered kind of ad nauseum on multifamily and just thinking about kind of the core multifamily margin and mix. If we were to see your multifamily business, which is currently about 13% of sales go to say, 8%, 9%, 10% of sales. Can you help us understand or quantify the margin impact to the total company from that type of a change? It mix, again, setting aside the current over-earning dynamics and just focusing on kind of that being a better than average core margin?\nPeter Jackson: So I want to be careful here. I totally understand your question. It\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t want to start getting into guidance for 2024. So I\u2019ll comment directionally based on some of the things we\u2019ve said throughout this year. I hope it\u2019s helpful to you. I think if you go through and look at the margins that we\u2019ve talked about over-earning, it\u2019s been different by quarter. You kind of average them together and you\u2019re kind of in that 150-ish range-ish. So I think that\u2019s a starting point for what we described as over-earning. Now, if you see some of the numbers you\u2019re describing and a big downturn, that adds another layer of challenge to the market and capacity and competition. So that kind of  I won\u2019t say all bets are off, but that\u2019s a different model than what I\u2019m referring to. I\u2019m talking about this year and what we think has been unusual in terms of the over-earning. But both of those will play together.\nMike Dahl: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nPeter Jackson: Good morning.\nKetan Mamtora: Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey. I\u2019m just curious, can you talk a little bit about how some of the regions are doing as far in October? We talked about some of the product categories, but in terms of your key regions, are you seeing sort of any noticeable change in terms of one being either stronger or weaker versus the other?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. In the beginning of the year, definitely. As we came into this, we saw a lot sort of west to east, the markets got stronger, right? West was the worst. That changed a little bit as the year progressed. I\u2019d say west bottomed out and bounced a little bit. Central struggled a little longer. We\u2019ve seen certain parts of the, especially the south central sort of drag longer than we expected. Again, not horrible, but if I\u2019m comparing the year-over-year sales trends, they\u2019ve probably trailed the other markets. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything meaningful in terms of differences at this point. I think they\u2019re all pretty comparable.\nDave Rush: Yeah. I would say the west relatively has shown a little bit more of a bounce. That\u2019s for sure. I\u2019d say parts of Texas flattened for sure. I think we\u2019re seeing a nice uptick, relative uptick in the north central and in some of those markets. But we\u2019re at the beginning of the year, the discrepancy between great and not so great was wider, it\u2019s -- that gap\u2019s closed. It\u2019s more stable across all markets at this point from a perspective of year-over-year comparison.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Good luck.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Ketan.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.\nDave Rush: Good morning, Steven.\nSteven Ramsey: Hi. Good morning. On the 2024 market outperformance perspective, have you thinking about how to get that outperformance if it\u2019s new accounts or bigger penetration of existing accounts, just any color on the outperformance?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. I mean, there\u2019s a couple of key categories that we continue to run the same play, like in football, if they can\u2019t stop the run, we\u2019re going to keep running. We\u2019re going to keep investing in and taking advantage of the need for value-added products and services in this industry. Builders continue to wrestle with the labor availability problems. They continue to wrestle with on-site efficiency and effectiveness. They continue to wrestle with the cost of capital for the cycle times of building a home. That\u2019s what we\u2019re good at. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest. We\u2019ve got multiple plants coming online. We\u2019ve got more capacity coming online in markets where we think it\u2019s really going to be taken up quickly. So that\u2019s an important piece. The other big important piece for us is digital. We think that we already have a lead, we think we\u2019re already the easiest to do business with, we\u2019re the most efficient, we\u2019ve got the best technology and we\u2019re about to take a big leap in that space that we think is going to be both hugely beneficial to our customers, but also make us even more the supplier of choice and the partner of choice in this industry.\nDave Rush: The only thing I\u2019d emphasize is what Peter said at the very beginning. We\u2019re looking at the industry. We\u2019re seeing where our customers\u2019 pain points are and we identify those as opportunities for us. So we\u2019re trying and we\u2019re focusing on how we can help solve labor challenges for our customers and create opportunity for ourselves. We\u2019ve got core base operations in our major markets that do that today. We\u2019re looking to expand that into additional products. There\u2019s ways we can do what we\u2019re already good at and expand that and that\u2019ll grow share. The other thing I would add is, we have the last couple years been in somewhat of a maintenance mode because we have had to. We\u2019ve had sales guys that were covered up and just handling the business they already had. We\u2019re going to also make a concerted effort to invest in the sales board to go out and be more hunters than we are gatherers. So those two things we think are realistic initiatives that will help us grab share.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay. Helpful. And then on the 2024 scenarios, looks like the free cash flow midpoint is down about $500 million from the midpoint of the 2023 guide. What are the factors that drive the midpoint difference there between EBITDA, working capital and CapEx?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. You\u2019re right. The midpoint is down. Really straightforward answer on that and hopefully it\u2019s consistent with everything you guys know about us and that\u2019s that when we shrink this business, we release a tremendous amount of working capital. And when the business is stable, it\u2019s sort of flat. And when it\u2019s growing, we\u2019re going to use some working capital. We generally use a rule of thumb of about 10% incrementals and decrementals to sales as a good proxy for what happens in our working capital. Obviously, you got some puts and takes there. We\u2019ve done some good work on managing through some issues that we\u2019ve been talking about over the past couple of years. But the primary answer is just the working capital flex with the size of the topline.\nSteven Ramsey: All right. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: All right. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And it looks like we have reached our allotted time for our Q&A session. This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Rush",
            "content": "Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Before we begin, I want to formally welcome Heather to the Builders FirstSource team. We are excited to have someone with her deep knowledge and decades of experience leading Investor Relations, which is a critical function here. Heather, welcome. Now on to our Q3 performance. Despite industry volatility caused by macroeconomic headwinds, our resilient third quarter results reflect the strength of our value-added portfolio, broad footprint and operational initiatives we have put in place over the past several years. While challenges remain due to inflation and increasing mortgage rates, we continue to generate healthy margins. This is proof of our attractive product mix and the benefits of our investments in multifamily. We remain confident in our 2023 outlook, as we focus on being the best partner for our customers and executing our strategy to drive long-term growth. We continue to create robust free cash flow and invest in the business to operate more efficiently, increase customer loyalty and expand our footprint. We are committed to operational excellence, including capturing efficiencies in our supply chain, as well as investing in automation and process improvements. These efforts are driving productivity savings and helping address our customers' labor challenges now and into the future. We are helping our customers reduce cycle times, which is highlighted by improving our in-full deliveries from 94% last year to 96% during the third quarter. On-time and in-full deliveries ensure our customers have the right material at the right time, building their loyalty and trust in us. We are continuing our investments in value-added solutions organically and through M&A to help our customers build more efficiently. These accretive acquisitions have enhanced our value-added product coverage and helped us achieve a leading position in desirable markets. As we grow share in these higher margin products, we are driving mixed improvement across the business. Our strong free cash flow provides multiple paths for capital deployment, all towards creating shareholder value. Given the long runway of potential tuck-ins, we will remain acquisitive to bolster our growth potential, while maintaining a disciplined focus on the highest return opportunities. Looking at our third quarter highlights on slide four, gross margin was approximately 35% and only down slightly on a sequential basis. Despite normalization in core margins, our overall margins have remained resilient, primarily due to stronger mix in value-added products, including our multifamily business and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Our adjusted EBITDA margin also remains strong, highlighting our ability to manage our operations effectively in a challenging and dynamic environment. This execution is a reflection of our talented and focused field leadership team. Turning to slide five, we generated strong productivity savings of $54 million during the quarter. This reflects the effectiveness of our BFS One Team Operating System, which delivers value across the business by building people, excellence and growth. Our recent acquisitions in multifamily contributed an increase of 2% in sales and 4% in EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter. Multifamily remained a tailwind this quarter and we expect this strength to continue for the remainder of 2023 before declining around the second quarter of next year. Disciplined SG&A expense management remains a key focus area. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for cost reductions against future capacity needs. We are focused on our discretionary spending and our team has responsibly managed cost in the short-term, while executing our strategy for the long-term. Regarding our industry, the national builders have reported resilient results by providing incentives such as interest rate buydowns to ease affordability challenges and attract prospective buyers. The limited inventory of existing homes for sale is also steering traffic to new construction. As we look forward to 2024, we will maintain our best-in-class customer service, continue our emphasis on expanding our value-added product mix and launch our BFS digital tool to make building process faster, more efficient and more affordable. Turning to M&A on slide six, we continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. Through the third quarter, we have completed five deals with aggregate prior year sales of roughly $350 million. In September, we acquired Frank's Cash & Carry, a leading building material distributor with trust manufacturing in the Florida Panhandle. We are pleased that this acquisition will help us grow with builders in the area. And earlier in the third quarter, we acquired Church's Lumber, which expanded our presence in the Detroit market. We're excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. As shown on slide six, our M&A and organic investments have substantially increased our value-added product mix and diversified our end markets. We have seen the fruit of this growth in recent quarters through higher gross margins, even in a down housing market. Moving to slide seven, I would like to provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter, we prudently deployed capital in line with our stated priorities. We made two tuck-in acquisitions and repurchased over $200 million of shares, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $5.7 billion since the end of 2021 and remain on track to achieve our 2025 goal of deploying $7 billion to $10 billion of capital, as communicated our Investor Day in December 2021. Now let's turn to slide eight and nine for an update on our digital strategy. We are steadfast in our commitment to leading the digital evolution in our industry and generating new innovations to drive greater efficiency across home building and enhance our product and service offerings. As we look forward to our full product launch in Q1, we have made it a priority to drive digital adoption across our operations. myBLDR.com is designed to create efficiencies for both our team members and customers by offering improved transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. Taking with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, this gives our customers more control over the entire building process, saving both time and money for our customers and their clients, while making the homebuilding process more personalized. In the third quarter, we continued our product development and adoption efforts as we prepare for the upcoming full product launch. These are important milestones in our journey to reshape the industry and extend our lead as the partner of choice in the market and attain our goal of $1 billion in incremental sales by 2026. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our Investor Day next month. At BFS, we pride ourselves on helping our people achieve their career goals. A team member who has taken full advantage of every growth opportunity presented to her is Sue Dean, the General Manager of our Florence, South Carolina location. Through the various roles she's held over her more than 40 years with BFS, she's earned the nickname Sue Deany for her ability to solve problems and make magic happen. Since being promoted as General Manager, Sue has led her location to achieve exceptional results by recognizing her team members' potential and empowering them. It's stories like Sue's that made me excited to see all the different ways our team members can grow here at BFS. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our third quarter financial result in greater detail. Thanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we're executing on our strategic pillars to deliver long-term value creation. Our tireless team effort has resulted in a differentiated platform, setting us up for above market growth and exceptional profitability for years to come. I continue to be proud of our operational excellence, which is driving increased safety, productivity and profitability despite market headwinds. We are in a great position today and as end markets further stabilize, we are positioned for an even stronger future. We'll remain at the forefront of technology with our BFS digital tool, which I'm confident will be a game-changer for the industry. We are exceptionally well-positioned in the marketplace to navigate complex operating environments due to our value-added solutions, fortress balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation. We're excited to share more details about our longer term vision at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5th in Atlanta and look forward to seeing you there. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate the question. As you know, the multifamily projects have a longer life cycle, tend to be 19 months to 18 months. So what we're seeing in the backlog right now is healthy and will carry us through the first quarter of next year. What's changing, the dynamic that's changing a bit is the projects, the new projects are slower to come to market. We believe there's going to be a pause in some of the multifamily as the market digests what's coming, what's completing throughout this year and as they figure out the right balance between cost of capital and rents and what return they can get on the rents, we just think there's going to be a temporary pause and then things will start up again at the tail end of 2024. But again, because there's such a long cycle for those projects to get into the ground, we won't necessarily see that effect in 2024. So we're forecasting for multifamily to be off in 2024 as a result. And just to add, Matt, it's continued to drive costs out of the business that don't add value, the benefit of our platform and the fact that we've done the hard work in the last two years to integrate these companies. We have a 30-year average experience with our field leadership group. They know what to do, when to do it and how to manage those costs effectively to maximize whatever is presented to us. And we've identified a lot of opportunities to continue to focus on productivity and where we are now is we don't have to keep reinventing those opportunities because our scale allows us to push that across the platform and we have plenty of runway to take existing ideas in the markets that we haven't been able to push those ideas yet just because of our scale and find -- keep finding dollars to save. Thanks, Matt. Hi. Yeah. The only thing I'd add is the national builders continue to be stable, right? I'm not saying that they're expecting substantial robust growth, but they're definitely still going forward with the plans that they've communicated to us. Their ability to use interest rate buy downs and get a prospective buyer into a monthly payment they can afford is working. They're basically using that methodology to get a payment and then go from the payment to a selection of house based on that payment and that's working. So that's encouraging for the fourth quarter at least to stay at a stable rate and really only be affected by seasonality. The development is right on track. We had a preview this week, in fact, of some of the features and that continued to be wowed by our development team. But it's changed, it's not only changed for the customers we're going to introduce it to, but it's changed for our people. And we want to make sure we do this the right way, the prudent way, methodically, making sure the adoption goes the way we want, because we really only get one bite at this apple. And we want to make sure that what we do is the best way for us to ensure success. But what we're showing people, you're going to be impressed by. I can't wait for you guys to see it when you get to it live. Well, the smaller builders don't have the access to rate buydowns that the larger builders have had and that's really the main differentiating factor. Interestingly enough, it's a small percentage of the total market, but there's a marked increase in cash buyers, which is a big part of what's going to keep the smaller guys going as well. I think it's still, the word is, I would use it stable. Again, I don't think it'll be robust from a standpoint of every -- all the macroeconomic uncertainty getting resolved. But the demand is clearly there. I mean, I think that's what's carried us through with all the headwinds that we've faced as an industry in the last six months. The -- I think it's been a ultimate proof point that the long-term demand is there. So as far -- as long as we can keep that affordability equation in check, I think that it'll be a stable environment and that's what we're hearing from our larger customers. I would just add that, the thing I pay attention to is what's the average backlog in our plants today? Very healthy, three-week to four-week backlog. That's where we want to be because we want to be at that level of customer service as well. We're seeing that still stay steady and healthy. Yeah. Were you asking about price or our costs from vendors? Thanks, Keith. The only thing I'd add is, we have a focus on using our scale to leverage our supply chain opportunities better, get a lower landed cost, more direct sourcing. Those come in little bits. We get a bite here on a product, a bite there on a product, but over time they start adding up. That along with the investments we've made in the manufacturing, automation and the efficiencies gained there, again, a little bit at a time, but then you look back at six months of doing it and it's actually a meaningful number. Those things we're starting to be able to track and see actually help. Thank you. Hi, Kurt. Yeah. That's a great question. I would tell you, understand the pilots are not for learning how to implement. It's for learning how to develop. So what we've used the pilots for is get the product where we want it to get. Having said that, one of the favorite modules of the folks that are engaged is the one that you can take and put all the plans for HVAC, framing, plumbing, all into a module and it shows where those trades potentially would collide with each other and resolve that collision before it goes live into the field and that is the one that particularly builders think gives them the biggest and quickest return from savings, because it minimizes the mistakes that you would have to learn on the fly in the field and you get ahead of them. So that's probably the one that we get the most positive feedback on. But what we're really trying to do is get everything resolved from a customer perspective on the front end so when we go to a full product launch, they'll already have solved the problems that they're counting on us solving. Yeah. The only thing I'd add is, keep in mind we're talking the full year, right? We're not sure if we might have some more macro headwinds in the beginning of the year and at ease as the year goes on. But who knows? And what we hear more often than not, though, is the back half would probably be slightly better than the front half in that scenario. Well, what I can say definitively, it's embedded in our culture now. I mean, we have everybody in the field at all points. We offer incentives for any employee to come up with an idea and submit it and if it's an idea that we can use to cultivate savings from, we reward that employee for that idea. So, it is embedded in our culture. We have leaders from the field come together every year to set targets, set goals and try to identify initiatives that will be the primary focus. And what I'm proud about is our ability to consistently deliver savings each year. Well, the only thing, I guess, I want to clarify, Paul is, Paul's being from a standpoint of even planning for, embedding out and trying to get a project underway, it doesn't necessarily translate to when we would see sales from a new project because of the 19 months to 18 months of duration. But, so we're definitely anticipating a slowdown in multifamily. Peter? Yeah. The only thing I'd add is and why I use the term pause versus halt, is just the underlying housing demand need. I mean, if they can't get into single-family because of affordability concerns, multifamily is the next best option. And I think it will be relatively quick for the rent factor to be figured out to where we get to a rental number that's cheaper than a mortgage, maybe more than we wanted to pay, but at the end of the day, it's the best chance I've got to get my own place. So maybe pause is too optimistic, but it's something that I hold because of the overall demand that we see out there. Yeah. I would say the west relatively has shown a little bit more of a bounce. That's for sure. I'd say parts of Texas flattened for sure. I think we're seeing a nice uptick, relative uptick in the north central and in some of those markets. But we're at the beginning of the year, the discrepancy between great and not so great was wider, it's -- that gap's closed. It's more stable across all markets at this point from a perspective of year-over-year comparison. Good morning, Steven. The only thing I'd emphasize is what Peter said at the very beginning. We're looking at the industry. We're seeing where our customers' pain points are and we identify those as opportunities for us. So we're trying and we're focusing on how we can help solve labor challenges for our customers and create opportunity for ourselves. We've got core base operations in our major markets that do that today. We're looking to expand that into additional products. There's ways we can do what we're already good at and expand that and that'll grow share. The other thing I would add is, we have the last couple years been in somewhat of a maintenance mode because we have had to. We've had sales guys that were covered up and just handling the business they already had. We're going to also make a concerted effort to invest in the sales board to go out and be more hunters than we are gatherers. So those two things we think are realistic initiatives that will help us grab share."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our operating model in the face of macro volatility. We are maintaining a healthy balance sheet and prudently deploying capital to the highest return opportunities, which included share repurchases during the quarter. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and value creation for our shareholders. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our third quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our full year 2023 guidance and 2024 scenarios. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on slides 10 and 11. We delivered $4.5 billion in net sales. For organic sales decreased by 14%, driven by a 19% decline in single-family due to slower demand over the prior year, supply chain normalization and commodity deflation of approximately 9%. Multifamily grew by over 6%, driven by our recent acquisitions, as well as favorable margins, largely attributable to the longer lead time for this end market. R&R and other grew by over 1% amid increased sales focus and capacity versus the prior year. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to net sales. Importantly, value-added products represented 51% of our net sales this quarter, increasing 6 percentage points since Investor Day in Q4 2021. This reflects our position as the supplier of choice for these higher margin products. During the third quarter, gross profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 22% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 34.9%, decreasing 10 basis points due to normalization in core organic gross margins, offset by roughly 125 basis points of our previously discussed multifamily over earning. SG&A decreased $61 million to $940 million, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year and inflation. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $34 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 330 basis points to 20.7%, primarily attributable to decreased fixed cost leverage from lower sales. We remain focused on operating efficiently, containing costs and effectively integrating acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $813 million, down 31%, primarily driven by lower net sales due to a weaker housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained a robust 17.9%, up 90 basis points sequentially as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income of $534 million was down $280 million from the prior year quarter. The 34% decrease was largely due to lower net sales. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.24, down 19%, compared to $5.20 in the prior year period. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.83 per share. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on slide 12. Our third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $665 million, down $835 million, compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a weaker housing market. Capital expenditures were $128 million. All in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $538 million. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30th, our free cash flow yield was 14.1%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 32%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1 times, while base business leverage was 1.5 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.1 billion, consisting of $1 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $100 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for $224 million at an average stock price of $136.22 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased nearly $1.6 billion of shares at an average price of $97.43 per share. We have approximately $400 million remaining on our most recent $1 billion share repurchase program, approved in April of 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation through a proven ability to deploy capital and deliver high returns. Now let's turn to our outlook on slide 13. Given affordability headwinds, our Q3 sales were a little softer than expected. However, the October sales trend was seasonally healthy, and our focus -- our continued focus and execution gives us confidence that we will achieve our full year base business and total company EBITDA guidance for 2023 that we outlined in our second quarter earnings call. For full year 2023, we expect total company net sales to be $16.8 billion to $17.1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 15.8% to 16.7%. We are guiding gross margins to a range of 34% to 35%. Our recent above-normal margins reflect a greater mix of value-added products, along with disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs. As we move through the end of the year, we expect both our gross margins and the multifamily business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2023 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $425. Our 2023 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and slide 14 of the investor presentation for a full list of these assumptions. Turning to slides 15 and 16, as a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clear -- to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales is $16.4 billion. Our base business EBITDA guide is $2.2 billion at a margin of 13.5%. Moving to slide 17, we recognize that 2024 is coming into focus as we approach year end. Like we did earlier this year, we have laid out a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions. I want to emphasize that this is not full year guidance for 2024, but these scenarios should help clarify our range of performance expectations for 2024 and demonstrate the strength of our best-in-class operating platform. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create value in any environment to support profitable growth. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts. Yeah. Just to add to it. I think it's the theme of normalization. We've seen such displacement in the industry over the last couple of years, multifamily included. You're going to see that theme, I think, in a lot of what we're talking about. Things are going well, but certainly normalizing back from some of that displacement. Yeah. So, I think, a couple of factors. The first is that we harvested the feedback from the economists. That's generally what we lean on, just like everybody else when it comes to the expectations for next year. We certainly try and temper it a little bit by, let's say, eliminating as statisticians do the high and the low end or the ones that look ridiculous in terms of trying to come up with a real number. Up until very recently, I would tell you that the sense was that we would see some nice growth next year. Admittedly, some of the more recent revisions from the economists have pulled it back, but I still think it's fairly favorable. So, what will play out? That's a fair -- it's a fair comment. Really, the reason why we gave the range that we did is we think there are a number of scenarios that could play out. If you want to go below the low end of this, I love the question because I think what you didn't ask is as informative as anything and that's nobody's challenging our double-digit margins, even when the market's down. And that's because we've demonstrated an ability to maintain those margins, to see healthy profitability, to benefit from the mix of our business and we expect to continue to be able to do that. Now, we'll certainly retain our discipline around costs. We'll continue to resize facilities and markets, depending on what the starts number is and what the business looks like. But I think our theme around here is really about consistent performance and operational excellence and not really seeing a huge need to do something unwise for the business, but just keep doing what we're doing because we're seeing great results. We won't give anything specific, but I think it's fair to say we do expect to see normalization into 2024, that pullback, the reversal of the multifamily in particular. But overall, that normalization theme, I think, applies to margins as well. Thanks. Sure. I can get started. I'm sure Dave will have a commentary as well. But the year has been a good year, right? We had that big reset at the beginning when the builders decided where their new rates would be, and it's been very stable. I think we did expect there to be a little bit more volume in the third quarter. We thought there'd be a little bit of a push. Certainly the commentary from the large nationals was very strong and for a variety of reasons, whether it be tone or weather or whatever the factors were, it just wasn't as good as we expected. Our performance was still quite good. We're certainly pleased with our profitability. But as we look at the way the year has played out into the fourth quarter, it's still healthy. The strength of the business continues and we're pleased with that ability to continue to see good flow through on the sales side, despite some of the headlines that sort of have gotten everybody so concerned. It's pretty modest in the first year. It's in the hundreds of millions of sales, but we've certainly got a lot of focus in the organization on the initial adoption, the communication and getting it into the hands of both our side of our sales people and leadership, as well as our customers. But so far, the feedback's been great. We're really pleased with the tools and the development successes. We're meeting milestones and feeling really good about the product that we're going to have to show the market and we're excited that the market's going to be able to benefit from the tools to improve efficiency and take costs out. Thanks, Trey. Yeah. Yeah. I guess the short answer is we are expecting some outperformance. But if I just could re-baseline on the key components. Single-family up, multifamily down on the normalization. The two big drivers there, obviously, continued normalization in both the sales and the margins in those displaced areas. Multifamily, those categories where we saw some out-earning, that's certainly happening. But we are confident in our ability to take share and see growth based on what we've been able to deliver and the investments we've made. Thanks, Joe. Yeah. No. That's a good question, Keith. One of the things that obviously drew my attention was that number this quarter and making sure that we understood exactly what was going on in the business. I'll start by saying, we feel very good about the number. It has performed better than expected versus the starts over the last year and it's given us confidence that both the volume and the margins are real and sustainable. What you're seeing in the comps, though, is that last year when the thing -- when the market, when single-family starts really started to turn down, we saw a massive and meaningful impact on the lumber and lumber sheet goods, right, the core commodity component of our business. That turned down quick, but at the same time, we were still seeing growth in our value-added categories. The manufacturer product, window stores and millwork, all still growing as we were working through all that backlog, right? The extended cycle times by the builders, the lack of product by the vendors, that was clearing. So that was a dynamic last year. This year, we're lapping that. And so what we've seen is that, well, statistically or on a percentage basis a bit weaker than some of the other categories and looking worse on average. It's actually in line. It's just a little bit of timing in terms of the year-over-year. So, still feel good about it, still investing, still seeing the benefits, both on the profitability and the revenue line, but a little bit of comp issue. I'd say in general, it's across the Board. We've talked a lot about inflation and some of the impacts there. Some of that has pulled back. We've seen certain categories pull back. We've seen the competition increase and some of those margins erode. Clearly, the bulk of it, the vast majority of it is on the commodity components, but we've seen a little bit elsewhere, probably value add, no, not probably, value add the least in terms of margin normalization, but across the Board, I think it's fair to say. I think we've talked about it in prior quarters, there are a couple of categories that we've seen make some moves, probably, the better, the most obvious example is after commodities is engineered lumber. They had some pretty substantial price increases and have given a portion of that back. I would say in general, though, it's been fairly modest. Good news is there have been cost increases for the most part that's leveled out. We're back to a regular, normal increase for cost of inflation and that's it. Yeah. I mean, R&R is fairly small for us, as you know. In that 20% of the business range, it's inclusive of our retail and commercial categories. So that's -- there's a lot in there. In general, what we've seen is that we've had a bit more capacity available as the overall market has slowed and that's allowed us to focus in and we've had some success. So while there have been, we see it as well, some headlines out of the economists that the investment side on the R&R might be pressured, we're feeling pretty good about what we've seen so far and our ability to fill available capacity by just offering our better services and product portfolio and expertise to categories of customers who want it but haven't been able to get access to it. Yeah. No. That's the million-dollar question, Collin. You're absolutely right. We continue to wrestle with this. We continue to see the trends of that normalization, right? The share that we took, that we took a lot of and given back a little bit of it. The price that we took and we took a lot of and given back a little bit of it. It has played out, but I think it's been slower than we've anticipated. This quarter we did see a fair amount of what we expected. I think where the beat came, at least in my mind, was some of the timing around some of the rebates, some of the productivity, some of the favorable tailwinds and some of the product mix, which is a little better than expected. Not massive, but it accumulated into a number that was a healthy beat on the margin line, to your point, expected. We do. Yeah. We think those things are kind of hand in glove, both the volumes and then the resulting margins as competition levels a little bit. Thank you. Yeah. So there's a couple of different pieces, right? If you stipulate, which I think you have, that we've set multifamily aside for all the reasons we've already talked about, I think the storyline on single-family is that we've seen the bulk of the margin normalization in the core products. There's more to go, but I think we've seen the bulk of it. If you look at subcategories quarter-over-quarter, so Q3 2023 to Q3 2022, you're talking mid-single digits percentages of margin that we've given back in the commodity space. We've given back price and margin in every one of the categories. So that normalization that we've been talking about, we've been digesting it and we've been processing it. I don't think we're done. I think when we look at the numbers, we see the trends in certain categories and markets, there's probably another leg there, but it's far smaller than the first leg. So we're in the sixth, seventh inning here. We're not in the second inning. That said, there's certainly every quarter timing and things that come through in terms of, like Dave said, when we see benefits, when we see the timing on certain rebates, that sort of thing and multifamily is not to be minimized, right? It's been a big deal for us this year and we do think it will normalize into next year. Maybe the best example of that that Dave was just referring to is the shoppable digital twin. So that has been a core aspect of this, right? You're taking the plan, you're putting it into that three-dimensional environment and the real bang for the buck is the shopability. They want to be able to pick up a siding or a roofing or whatever and see it on the rendering, have it be impacted with the real design, be able to quote it and shop it and buy it. And that entire experience, as you might imagine, is quite complex, right? It's challenging both technically and from a UI/UX user interface, user experience type of dynamic. So what we've been really focused on this summer is putting our product in front of them, right, as it stands, getting the feedback of how it works, how they're actually going to transact and interact with that tool and making the tweaks behind the scenes to really drive the technology and the functionality to meet that need state head-on. And so when Dave talks about development and using the feedback from customers on development, that's a really big one for us and super excited about what the teams are coming up with. We got to see some pilot stuff recently or some demo stuff recently. I agree with Dave. You all are going to like it. Thanks, Kurt. No question, affordability rates in particular are in focus for us in terms of trying to predict that starts number. It's an interesting balance, though. We've continued to see very healthy, very stable, as Dave referred to sales and production through the industry. But that question of is there a magic number of mortgage rates that really puts a step down type of impact on this industry is in everybody's minds. So far, no. But we're certainly keeping a close eye on it and really what you're seeing here, and I was trying to highlight it a little bit before, these are different ranges that we've seen from economists. We think this encompasses what we saw from all the economists that we were gathering in the last month or two. So, certainly, we'll continue to dial this in. We'll continue to update it based on what we're seeing. But that's kind of the context in which we came up with it. We're ready regardless and I think that's kind of our outline here with the scenarios is we've got a high performing business. We're going to deliver really favorable positive numbers regardless of which way this goes. So, we didn't want to hesitate to put this out there for people to contemplate because sometimes the skepticism or the fear in the marketplace can become a little more than what's appropriate. Yeah. So I'm glad you asked that question, because I do want to differentiate between a couple of things. First of all, the 3% to 5% is our goal internally. So please do not ever load that into your numbers, because I don't want to steer you the wrong direction. In terms of what we've been able to do, it certainly gets harder, right? I mean, you talk about it being the first couple of years of being harvesting the low-hanging fruit. We have a tremendous opportunity to continue to deliver productivity savings, but I think those savings become a bit more challenging, a bit more programmatic over time. So I think a moderating of the annual number is appropriate, but we intend to continue to deliver on that over time and that will be an important part of our discussion in December as well. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So, I guess, the comments I'd make when we talked about a bounce back in a couple of different scenarios, Dave did refer to it a multifamily, we talked a little bit about on single-family. So, I want to make sure we separate those two for starters. Multifamily, we don't know when the pause is. There's no question in our minds, downside is coming, right? We can see that because we're selling into the middle of next year already and we're seeing the declines in quotes and bids and so on. Now, the one thing I also want to be real careful of is, we don't sell into high rises or some of the other urban environment. That's not really our play for the most part, right? Where five-story and below would frame multifamily structures, which we do think is going to be a more responsive to the housing needs that we see in the U.S. market in this day and age, and some of the other dynamics that we think are favorable to that. But your comments are accurate in terms of what we're seeing. There is certainly pessimism, the higher rates have made deals and projects more difficult to pencil out and we have seen a downturn. I would say at this stage, we're not seeing the numbers you've been teeing up there. Is it possible? Sure. Wouldn't out -- wouldn't rule out it going anywhere. For us, though, I think our ability to do a couple of things. One is to, to scale our facilities, change shifts. But also the second thing is to rebalance where we put our load from a value-added products perspective. We can certainly move single-family to multifamily and vice versa, which we've been doing recently. So we'll continue to do that and ensure that we're protecting this franchise because we absolutely believe in multifamily in the long run, even if there's some cyclicality in the near-term. To your second question, which is the ratio of that multifamily business and what it is weighted towards. I would say that it's probably 80% weighted towards the start and more 20% weighted towards the completion, just directionally and that's because the bulk of it is trust and upfront product with a bit of it being related to millwork, which is a little closer to the completion, not at the completion, but a bit closer with that. So I want to be careful here. I totally understand your question. It's a good question. I don't want to start getting into guidance for 2024. So I'll comment directionally based on some of the things we've said throughout this year. I hope it's helpful to you. I think if you go through and look at the margins that we've talked about over-earning, it's been different by quarter. You kind of average them together and you're kind of in that 150-ish range-ish. So I think that's a starting point for what we described as over-earning. Now, if you see some of the numbers you're describing and a big downturn, that adds another layer of challenge to the market and capacity and competition. So that kind of  I won't say all bets are off, but that's a different model than what I'm referring to. I'm talking about this year and what we think has been unusual in terms of the over-earning. But both of those will play together. Good morning. Yeah. In the beginning of the year, definitely. As we came into this, we saw a lot sort of west to east, the markets got stronger, right? West was the worst. That changed a little bit as the year progressed. I'd say west bottomed out and bounced a little bit. Central struggled a little longer. We've seen certain parts of the, especially the south central sort of drag longer than we expected. Again, not horrible, but if I'm comparing the year-over-year sales trends, they've probably trailed the other markets. I don't know that there's anything meaningful in terms of differences at this point. I think they're all pretty comparable. Thanks, Ketan. Yeah. I mean, there's a couple of key categories that we continue to run the same play, like in football, if they can't stop the run, we're going to keep running. We're going to keep investing in and taking advantage of the need for value-added products and services in this industry. Builders continue to wrestle with the labor availability problems. They continue to wrestle with on-site efficiency and effectiveness. They continue to wrestle with the cost of capital for the cycle times of building a home. That's what we're good at. So we're going to continue to invest. We've got multiple plants coming online. We've got more capacity coming online in markets where we think it's really going to be taken up quickly. So that's an important piece. The other big important piece for us is digital. We think that we already have a lead, we think we're already the easiest to do business with, we're the most efficient, we've got the best technology and we're about to take a big leap in that space that we think is going to be both hugely beneficial to our customers, but also make us even more the supplier of choice and the partner of choice in this industry. Yeah. You're right. The midpoint is down. Really straightforward answer on that and hopefully it's consistent with everything you guys know about us and that's that when we shrink this business, we release a tremendous amount of working capital. And when the business is stable, it's sort of flat. And when it's growing, we're going to use some working capital. We generally use a rule of thumb of about 10% incrementals and decrementals to sales as a good proxy for what happens in our working capital. Obviously, you got some puts and takes there. We've done some good work on managing through some issues that we've been talking about over the past couple of years. But the primary answer is just the working capital flex with the size of the topline. All right. Appreciate it."

Our remarks in the press release, presentation, and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Rush: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Entering 2023, we prepared for a challenging and dynamic year. During the first half, we had better than anticipated performance, driven by the strength of our value-added product portfolio, continued outperformance in Multi-Family, and a more stable housing environment than originally projected. Multi-Family is an area we identified as providing strong growth potential and in market diversification over the long term. We are truly seeing the differentiated platform we have put together over the past few years generate results. We continue to exceed our near-term targets through contributions from operational initiatives instill over the last few years, and by executing our strategic priorities, which is a testament to the unwavering commitment and dedication of our amazing team members. We are focused on delivering exceptional customer service and always strive to be the easiest company in the industry to do business with. We\u2019re driving mixed improvement through value added share growth, while continuing to expand through tuck-in acquisitions. Our acquisitions in recent years have allowed us to enhance our value-added offerings and also extend our reach to a more diverse customer base in attractive markets. Moreover, these acquisitions have proven to be immediately accretive to our earnings. We continue to consistently generate robust free cash flow and prudently deploy capital, making two tuck-in acquisitions and repurchasing over $700 million of shares in the second quarter alone. Despite the headwinds posed by elevated mortgage rates and affordability challenges, our resilient results in the first half of 2023 give us confidence that we have the right strategies in place with a customer-centric approach and an incredible team that is executing at the highest level to successfully navigate this dynamic economic environment. Many single-family builders are showing stabilizing demand partially due to widespread shortages of existing homes for sale, driving healthy new construction. Public builders have been reporting a stream of stronger-than-expected results and taking proactive steps, such as interest rate buy-downs to help get prospective buyers off the sidelines. With home prices normalizing in many places, our focus on value-added solutions, digital innovations and customer service is helping builders improve their construction efficiencies. We are helping our customers lower cycle time, which is highlighted by our continued improvement on in full deliveries from 93% last year to 96%, during the second quarter. On time and in full deliveries ensure our customers have the right material at the right time. Looking at our second quarter highlights on slide 4. Our gross margin percentage increased 40 basis points to 35.2% due to stronger mix in value-added products overall, largely driven by our Multi-Family segment and the related positive impact from commodity cost timing. We maintained a healthy double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin, showcasing our ability to execute effectively from an operations perspective in a challenging environment. This execution is a reflection of our talented field leadership team, which averages 30-plus years of industry experience. Turning to slide 5. We drove strong productivity across the business by delivering $50 million in savings during the quarter. Our BFS One Team Operating System continues to generate robust efficiencies, focused on manufacturing and delivery improvement. Our recent acquisitions in Multi-Family contributed an increase of 4% on the top-line and 9% to EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter. Multi-Family was an exceptionally strong tailwind this quarter, and we expect this streak to continue for the remainder of 2023. While we expect Multi-Family to normalize around the first or second quarter of next year, we remain optimistic that, Single-Family starts will be on stronger footing in the same period, compared to the first half of 2023. As it relates to our cost structure, controlling SG&A and other expenses remains a vital focus for us. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for variable cost reductions against future capacity needs. We are focused on our discretionary spending, and our team has done a great job on managing costs in the short-term, while executing our strategy over the long-term. Turning to M&A on slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities with a disciplined approach. Thus far in 2023, we have completed four deals and are still committed to our goal of investing an average of $500 million in M&A per year for the next several years. During the second quarter, we added millwork capabilities through the acquisitions of JB Millworks and Builders Millwork Supply. And earlier this week, we acquired Church\u2019s Lumber, which expands our presence and scale in the Detroit market. We\u2019re excited to welcome our talented new team members to the BFS family. Our M&A and organic investments have substantially increased our value-added product mix and diversified our end markets since Q4 2021, as shown on slide 6. We have seen the fruit of this growth in recent quarters, and we have driven our gross margins higher even in a down housing starts environment. Moving to slide 7. I would like to provide an update on capital allocation. In the second quarter, we deployed over $850 million of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $5.3 billion since the end of 2021 and remain on track to achieve our 2025 goal of $7 billion to $10 billion communicated at our Investor Day in 2021. Now let\u2019s turn to slide 8 for an update on our digital strategy. We firmly believe our long-term commitment to new digital innovations and technologies will deliver greater efficiency across homebuilding and enhance our product and service offerings. We continue to play a pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry and have made a significant investment in growing our digital platform. We have made it a priority to ensure digital adoption is integrated across our operations as we seek to create a platform that will lead to building better, more affordable homes. myBLDR.com serves as the entry point to our collaborative project management platform. It is designed to create efficiency for both BFS and our customers by offering improved transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. It combines Paradigm\u2019s next-generation estimating technology with our 3D Home Configuration model. Together, these tools allow our customers more control over their design, cost estimating and building process ultimately saving both our customers and their clients, time and money. We are still in early innings and have more to come as we continue to roll out these digital solutions to our end users but we remain confident in our ability to gain an incremental $1 billion in product sales by 2026. We believe our sustained commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies will extend BFS\u2019 lead as the partner of choice in the market, and we look forward to providing more detail on our long-term strategy at our Investor Day in December. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I want to say how grateful I am to our team members for continuing to execute in a challenging environment and providing excellent service to our customers on a daily basis. At BFS, we keep our high-performing, people-first culture at the heart of all we do. That\u2019s why we like to recognize team members in our organization that embody the true spirit of our, Be More, Do More, Build More together philosophy. Perla Jover is an Inventory Control Supervisor in Houston, Texas, who has made a huge impression on her managers and colleagues. In May, she was honored as one of our first team MVPs for exemplifying our core values. Perla\u2019s attitude -- positive attitude for willingness to jump in and help in her pursuit of excellence really makes a difference on the team. The supervisors appreciate how she embraces learning new skills and mentoring others, especially young women new to our industry. Employees like Pearl make me proud to lead this great organization. Without the full effort of our team, we would not have had the outperformance that we achieved during the first half of this year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our performance during the quarter further highlighted the resilience of our business in the face of macro pressures. I\u2019m particularly proud of our gross margin results driven by our increased mix of value-added products and services. We are well positioned in the marketplace with differentiated solutions and a healthy balance sheet. We continue to generate robust free cash flow and prudently deploy capital. I\u2019m confident that the combination of our industry-leading scale, ongoing investments in value-added and digital products, and strong financial position will lead to a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year, and sustained growth in the years to come. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I\u2019ll recap our second quarter results. Second, I\u2019ll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I\u2019ll discuss our full year 2023 guidance. Let\u2019s begin by reviewing our second quarter performance on slide 10. We delivered $4.5 billion in net sales. Core organic sales decreased by 22%, which was better than expected, despite a 31% decline in Single-Family due to slower demand over the prior year. Multi-Family continues to be a bright spot, growing by nearly 30%. As Dave mentioned, the strength in Multi-Family was driven by our recent acquisitions as well as favorable margins, largely attributable to the longer lead time for this end market. R&R and other grew by nearly 5%, mainly due to increased sales focus and capacity versus the prior year. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 4 percentage points of growth to net sales. Importantly, value-added products represented 53% of our net sales this quarter versus 45% in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting our improving position as a supplier of choice for these higher-margin products. During the second quarter, gross profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 33.9% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 40 basis points to 35.2%, driven primarily by a stronger mix in value-added products overall and with particular strength in Multi-Family value-add. SG&A decreased $28 million to $1.02 billion, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $52 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 740 basis points to 22.5%, primarily attributable to decreased leverage on net sales. We remain focused on operating efficiently, containing costs and effectively integrating operations and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $769 million, a decline of 49%, primarily driven by lower net sales, including a decline in core organic products attributable to a slower housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained a robust 17%, up 70 basis points sequentially as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income was $498 million, down from an adjusted net income of $1.07 billion in the prior year quarter. The 54% decrease in adjusted net income was primarily driven by a decrease in sales volumes and commodity deflation. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $3.89 compared to $6.26 in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EPS was partially offset by our repurchase of nearly 7 million shares, which added roughly $0.20 per share during quarter. Our second quarter results exceeded the guidance we provided in May, supported by our core business mix and gross margin strength amid outperformance in value-added products. We continue to gain confidence in the strength and durability of our margin performance, and we believe our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 29%-plus versus our previous expectation of 28%-plus. Now, let\u2019s turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on slide 12. Our second quarter operating cash flow was approximately $391 million, down $556 million compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a reduction in Single-Family starts. Capital expenditures were $121 million. All in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $270 million. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30, our free cash flow yield was 17.7%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 41.4%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1 times, while base business leverage was 1.6 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $900 million, consisting of $800 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $100 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares for $723 million at an average stock price of $103.68 per share. In total, we have repurchased approximately 41% of our outstanding shares since August of 2021. We have approximately $s600 million remaining on our most recent $1 million share repurchase authorization from April 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital, and we\u2019ll continue to look for organic and inorganic growth opportunities while maintaining our fortress balance sheet. Let\u2019s turn to our outlook on slide 14. Our July sales trends are encouraging and fuel our confidence in the resilience of our industry. Several of our national customers have begun to provide full year guidance, providing us with better visibility and greater confidence in the strength of the market. As a result, we are establishing our full year base business and total company guidance as we enter the back half of 2023. Our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing for commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized margins and static commodity prices at $400 per 1,000 board feet. This is helpful to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance in our industry. Our base business guide on net sales is $16.6 billion. Our base business EBITDA guide is $2.2 billion at a margin of roughly 13.3%. At this time, we are also providing total company guidance for full year 2023, including total net sales, gross margins, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. For full year 2023, we expect total company net sales to be $16.8 billion to $17.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 15% to 17%. And we are guiding gross margins to a range of 33% to 35%. Our recent above normal margins reflected greater mix in value-added products along with disciplined pricing required to offset our increases in operating costs from inflation. As we move through the second half of the year, we expect both our gross margins and Multi-Family business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2023 free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. Our free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $450. Our 2023 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and slide 15 of the investor presentation for a full list of these assumptions. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are exceptionally well positioned to drive our strategic goals. Our guidance illustrates our belief that we will deliver a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year and sustain that momentum in the years to come. As we continue to reap the benefits of our transformed business, we are positioned to achieve an upwardly revised long-term normalized gross margin of 29% or higher. I\u2019m confident that our best-in-class operating platform will continue to generate substantial free cash flow, providing further financial flexibility on top of our already healthy balance sheet. Importantly, we will continue to diligently deploy capital and maximize long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.\nDave Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we feel better about the current building environment today than we did at the beginning of the year. We\u2019re executing our strategy and continuing to invest to drive future growth. Our results in the first half reflect our hard work over the past few years to build a differentiated platform that has BFS set up to win in any environment. I am proud of our operational excellence, which is driving increased safety, productivity and profitability despite market headwinds. We are in a great position today and as end markets further stabilize, we are positioned for an even stronger future. We\u2019ll continue to be at the forefront of technology with our digital strategy, which I\u2019m confident will be a game changer for the industry. We are exceptionally well positioned to drive shareholder value this year and in years to come. I\u2019m excited to share more details at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5th in Atlanta and look forward to seeing you there. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let\u2019s please open the call now for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. And congrats on the results. I\u2019ll start with the question on the long-term gross margin guide, which you\u2019ve now raised twice consecutively. So, my question is, what\u2019s changed in the past 90 days that\u2019s kind of given you that incremental confidence? And then, of course, to take another step forward, given your gross margin of 33% to 35% this year, what are the signs you\u2019d be looking for to kind of give you step in -- or confidence in yet another step higher from that 29%. So, I\u2019ll pause there. That\u2019s the first question.\nPeter Jackson: Well, first of all, thanks, Matt. We appreciate it. We\u2019re excited about the business and certainly pleased with the way gross margins have been continuing to evolve. We\u2019ve talked about it for -- well, a couple of years now, actually. The strength of the core business, particularly post merger and what we\u2019ve been able to do to grow value-add as a mix of our business has been very impactful. And what we\u2019ve continued to look for, particularly this year, is the normalization, right, with the supply chain getting back to normal, the reset and the level of starts, we were really concerned about what that would mean in terms of the overall market\u2019s ability to sustain margins. I don\u2019t think we were alone in that. What we\u2019ve looked for this year is the performance being at a stable level. And while we\u2019re not quite there yet, we\u2019ve certainly seen stability be established in a lot of parts of the market, a lot of regions, a lot of product categories where we\u2019ve seen things sort of get to normal and level out. When we talk about gross margins, it can be a little bit misleading. Again, this quarter, we saw a substantial tailwind due to Multi-Family, what I would describe as sort of transitory tailwinds. At least a couple of hundred basis points this quarter was really just due to the way the commodity timing, the cost of commodities played out versus some of our contracts. So, we\u2019re pleased with it. Obviously, we\u2019ll take it. But we don\u2019t want to signal to anybody that that\u2019s permanent. And we still have certain areas of the market where things continue to normalize, and we\u2019re not quite sure where things will end up, but we know the pressure is down. We\u2019ve certainly seen that. We\u2019re up 40 bps overall on gross margins. But certainly, that indicates if you take out Multi-Family, some pretty decent step-down in the core, that\u2019s what we thought was going to happen, and that\u2019s pretty much how it\u2019s played out, and we\u2019ll continue to look for that. But even with all of that said, it\u2019s better than we expected. We certainly have gained a lot of confidence in the strength of our business, the strength of value-add, which continues to be really, really desirable for our builder customers, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in it and feel good about what that means for normal margins going forward. We\u2019ll continue to monitor it. I mean, we\u2019ve left the plus at the end because we think -- obviously, we\u2019re performing better than that now, and we\u2019re just going to wait and see where things normalize over time.\nDave Rush: Hey Matt, thanks again. This is Dave. I would just add, since the merger with BMC, we\u2019ve invested over $100 million in upgrading and automating our manufacturing capabilities, and we\u2019re starting to see the fruits of that. And we\u2019re getting a better feel of how that\u2019s going to contribute to margins over the longer period as well.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Thanks, guys, for that comprehensive answer, very helpful. So, I guess, some of what you mentioned, Peter, on the Multi-Family side is going to address this next question. Kind of zooming into the base business, it looks like you\u2019re saying there\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, maybe some rounding, but roughly $600 million of earnings above the base this year. How much of that is -- that Multi-Family commodity cost timing, other commodity, maybe OSB? And could you break down if there\u2019s anything else in there besides commodity that\u2019s kind of above the base business? Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. No, good question, Matt. So just a basic reminder, the base business is really just trying to take out any commodity fluctuation in two ways, right? Anything that\u2019s not $400 lumber we normalize for, and we also normalize for margins attributable to those same commodities. So we don\u2019t normalize for margins anywhere else, but it does have the impact within that $600 million that you mentioned that yes, there\u2019s some rounding. Within that $600 million that you mentioned, that\u2019s attributable to margins. And this particular year, it\u2019s mostly margins. So, the vast majority of what has flowed through is the normalization of those outperforming margins over the course of the year. There is certainly a component of that that is from the Multi-Family, right? So it\u2019s because a piece of the commodities flows into our manufactured products, including roofing, floor, trusses as well as wall panels, which obviously have a significant component of commodity in them. So, we take an adjustment for that. So, that is the primary driver is the margins attributable to the commodity change this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: Yes, I\u2019d echo the congrats on the outstanding work in the quarter.\nDave Rush: Thanks, Trey. I appreciate it.\nTrey Grooms: Sure. So, on Multi-Family, I think you mentioned that you expect that to remain strong through this year. So, are you seeing anything in your backlog or hearing anything from your customers about their backlogs and Multi-Family that would suggest that this slowdown is kind of coming around that time or anything on the timing there, or is that more just kind of a -- kind of high-level expectation at this point?\nDave Rush: Yes. We are seeing evidence from our customers that at the tail end of this year, there\u2019s going to be a lot of supply that comes online all at around the same time. And that in a typical year would have to be digested before a lot of these other new projects come online. That\u2019s one factor. The other factor is the cost of capital. And being able to make sure that the rents that they\u2019re going to generate versus the cost of capital, that equation has to work out exactly right as well. And until some of that -- or some of that glut of openings that comes online at the end of the year, it gets digested. Those kind of dynamics have a little bit of time to work themselves out. So, what we\u2019re hearing is there might be a little bit of a delay in the first and second quarter and then things start picking back up again. The problem, as you know, is these projects are so long in time from plan to execution that we feel like there\u2019s going to be a lag in the first half of next year. But overall, we believe the Multi-Family will be a great segment for us to be in, and it will be a temporary scenario, not necessarily something long term that we got to worry about.\nTrey Grooms: Right. Got it. Okay. And then, Peter, you mentioned you\u2019re expecting gross margins to moderate through the year. Sorry if I missed this, but you\u2019re calling out 33% to 35% for the year. You\u2019ve been running at the 35% range. So, are you seeing any change or any more normalization in the margin thus far in the third quarter, or is it still kind of holding in at that high end of the range for now?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. No, good question. So, we continue to see -- again, it goes to the countervailing trends. We continue to see some erosion in the core market gross margin, less than we expected, but it has continued, and I think we\u2019ll continue to see that through the back half of this year. And then we know pretty -- with pretty reasonable accuracy how Multi-Family will play out just because of the timing of the contracts that were related to the current purchase price of commodities and kind of where we\u2019re at. So, we\u2019ve got a pretty decent look. Certainly, there\u2019s been good performance in gross margins throughout the year, and I don\u2019t think July is significantly different, but the trends remain the same with the overlay of Multi-Family\u2019s normalization being pretty significant over the next year.\nTrey Grooms: Great. Thank you. If I could sneak one more in, a little bit more higher level. $100 billion or so invested in automation over the last few years, which you said is bearing fruit, which is pretty clear. Where are you in that process, or maybe how should we think about the amount of plants that you have that you would classify as automated? And where would you like that to be kind of over time?\nDave Rush: Yes. I would tell you, we feel really good about the level of automation we have where every plant has some level of automation. Obviously, there\u2019s more opportunity, and we have a pretty long runway there to continue to improve, and we\u2019re excited about that prioritizing those projects. And as you know, as we do acquisitions, typically, there\u2019s a level of automation that we go back in and upgrade those acquisitions with and we\u2019ll have that plan ongoing. We\u2019re a good customer for our automation vendor. And as much as we\u2019re always excited about talking about digital, we\u2019re also on our front foot when it comes to technology in this manufacturing space as well. So yes, we\u2019re excited about where this can continue to go.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: Thank you. And congrats on a strong quarter. A couple of things. I\u2019m just curious, one, how do you -- what is the M&A pipeline looking at this point? And given sort of housing has held in better than what people expected at the start of the year, has there been any sort of change in your approach to M&A or seller expectations?\nDave Rush: Thanks for the question. Yes, the M&A pipeline actually has improved. I think just the fact that things were changing at the beginning of the year and people weren\u2019t sure exactly how the year was going to play out, kept people on the sideline for the first half. We\u2019re seeing more opportunities now in the second half and a couple that we feel like are really good to look at. And we\u2019re excited about how we\u2019ll continue to invest in M&A in the future.\nKetan Mamtora: Got it. And is it possible at all -- Peter, you talked about sort of July started off quite well. Is there any way to sort of quantify what the July trend has been like even relative to sort of Q2 or maybe year-over-year?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. It\u2019s been a -- I don\u2019t know how to describe it other than refreshing year. For all of the concerns that we came into the year with due to interest rates, due to affordability, it has been a surprisingly and refreshingly normal year. We see good progression throughout the year, the normal seasonality that we would expect to see with busier months in the summer. We\u2019ve seen good utilization of our capacity. Nothing\u2019s been overwhelmed. We\u2019ve gotten quite busy in certain areas, but nothing has been catastrophic like during the big run around COVID. Same on behalf of our vendors, they\u2019ve performed very well. Few spots here and there where it\u2019s gotten a little tight, but by and large, the market has adjusted to the new volumes and really sold through quite well. And as we alluded to with our customer base, there\u2019s confidence in a lot of areas with regard to how consistently they\u2019ve been able to sell through what they\u2019ve been building. It seems pretty obvious that the demand is still out there. And with the reluctance to move out of an existing home, new construction has really been a bright spot, and we\u2019re excited to be leaning into that quite well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates.\nAdam Baumgarten: Just a question on the environment. With the ramping starts you\u2019ve seen year-to-date, are you hearing about any supply chain strains? Maybe not for you guys specifically, but for the industry or maybe an extension in construction cycle times for the builders?\nDave Rush: Yes. I think the supply chain has normalized to a great extent. I think -- versus when you saw the COVID-related issues, we\u2019re not seeing anything of that magnitude out there. There\u2019s a couple of product categories where lead times are or slightly extended, premium windows is an example, but still, things are normalizing. Now, with the uptick in demand, there is some adjustments by a lot of our vendor partners on staffing and getting staff back up to the new normal of demand, but those look to be very temporary and very slight. So, I would say, all in all, from a supply chain perspective, we\u2019re in pretty good shape.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay, got it. Good to hear. And then just switching gears to the R&R business, I think you had mentioned increased capacity being a tail and maybe just some more color around that. And then also were there any product categories that really stood out as particularly strong in the R&R channel in the quarter?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So R&R, the way we service R&R, there are a few markets where we\u2019re very focused on it with specific cases. But for the most part, we serve both the Pro new construction and the Pro R&R markets through the same chance. So, you end up with certain time lines where you\u2019ve got pretty heavy demand from one or the other. And obviously, over the past couple of years, the bulk of it has come from the new construction side. So with that pullback a bit, they just opened up more capacity, that Pro R&R business. And as I said in the past, the Pro R&R contractor would generally prefer to use us if we\u2019re available because of all the incremental services and expertise we provide versus a traditional big box or a small player. The categories, the product categories, I would say we performed well across the outline of products or the family of products within Pro R&R. I would say, just stepping back for the whole business, we\u2019ve continued to see really nice performance in the windows, doors and millwork category. That\u2019s been an outperformer for us all year, and we\u2019re pretty excited about that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: First question is kind of back on the Multi-Family side. Obviously, there\u2019s been a few big moving pieces. You\u2019ve made some investments both organically and inorganically in that space. And then, Multi-Family as a mix of percentage -- mix of the overall market has increased. You look at permit activity that\u2019s now dropping off, and you alluded to some normalization. And in Multi-Family, I think, sales, not just margins looking out to next year. Maybe can you help kind of quantify what you think has been internal versus market shifts? And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s best framed as what you think your new normal mix of Multi-Family would be when you sort through kind of the ebbs and flows? Maybe a little more quantification there or color?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Yes. No, your point is right on. We\u2019ve had a lot of change in that Multi-Family category. We\u2019ve invested a lot, and we\u2019ve been very successful, even in the core business in terms of how we\u2019ve competed in the marketplace. I think that the overall impact of our kind of leaning into this has been a big change in the market and a big change for us. So it\u2019s increased that Multi-Family mix, but it\u2019s a mix that\u2019s attributable largely to truss, right? So we\u2019re not in sky scrapers. We\u2019re not in shopping malls or certain large-scale apartment complexes, right? We\u2019re in four-storey and below wood frame structures. That\u2019s sort of our operating arena and our sweet spot. That has been doing remarkably well. And I think we have been able to improve our positioning in the market and be seen as a serious, reliable competitor. We\u2019ve got the ability to withstand sort of ebbs and flows. We can be counted on to deliver even if there are some capacity constraints through our network of facilities around the country. So, we do think we\u2019ve gained share. We do -- we know we bought share, and we think that that has all sort of come together to really give us some nice momentum. And that momentum is true, even though we\u2019re really in the middle of integration. So, this is still early days for us in terms of getting all those teams to work together. So, we\u2019re really excited about what the future holds. Now, you are right about the reset. We think that as we get into probably back half of next year, when we\u2019re seeing things normalize, maybe beyond that, it\u2019s probably closer to 10% directionally, we\u2019ll dial that in for you, but it\u2019s probably 10% of sales in an environment like we\u2019re in today in a normal world.\nDave Rush: Yes. I would just add. We were purposeful when we added that acquisition and entrants into that Multi-Family segment, knowing that it would be a diversification play from Single-Family and vice versa. So, what we\u2019re expecting is as Multi-Family normalizes, we\u2019re expecting Single-Family to remain on stable footing. In addition, in the truss world, what makes it so -- such a good investment for us is we can run Single-Family jobs out of a Multi-Family truss plan. So, we do that today. When we have Multi-Family plants that are maxed out, we run Multi-Family jobs out of our Single-Family plants and vice versa, when each side has more work than they have capacity. So, we\u2019ve got a plan in place to manage through all ebbs and flows of both sides of those businesses and we did so intentionally.\nMike Dahl: Got it. Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then my second question, you\u2019ve spent a lot of time kind of dissecting the margins. Maybe at a high level, just between commodities, between the Multi-Family legs, when you\u2019re now talking about a 29% plus on normal, can you just kind of help us simplify this at a high level in terms of margin differentials by not necessarily every product category, but high level. Just where do you think your new value-add margin will be? Is it kind of like a low-30s value-add and a 20 on lumber? Just any -- what\u2019s kind of driving at a high level the blended 29%?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So, if you think about the historical kind of guidances that we\u2019ve had, we were running -- we were running gross margins kind of 25% to 27%. We talked about how the commodities were generally kind of high-teens to low-20s for gross margins. We talked about how value-add was 800 to 1,000 basis points higher than that. I would tell you kind of where we are today with some of the noise in it. We\u2019re substantially higher than that on the value-add. But we\u2019ve also seen sort of increases across the board. The increases across the board we talked about a lot, just to reiterate, we\u2019ve seen some inflation, right? So if the cost of delivery is higher, the margins need to be higher in order to pay for the increased costs. So, we\u2019ve seen some incremental margin increase across the board to cover that. And then, the two things that have impacted it the most is you\u2019ve seen increased productivity. And what we\u2019ve talked about in Multi-Family, some displacement causing the margins to be higher, full stop. And you\u2019ve seen overall a pretty substantial mix shift away from the commodity side of the business, which used to be half of what we did back in the old days to closer to 25 to a third -- 25% to a third of our business now and that has allowed that normalized gross margin to really drift further and further up the more our mix swings. So, sort of all of those components are feeding in the productivity, the inflation, the overall mix shift to allow us to see that higher amount. But again, going from 35%, 34% for the full year is what we\u2019re signaling, right, for the midpoint, down to the 29%-plus that is the Multi-Family. That is the continued normalization. And we\u2019re going to continue to watch that play out, and we\u2019ll dial in that guidance as we get more confident.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsey: I wanted to continue the base EBITDA conversation along with the productivity. If I\u2019m connecting the dots, you\u2019re saying this year\u2019s sales and base EBITDA go down $100 million each and then the productivity savings midpoint is $130 million. So, backing out that midpoint of savings, decremental margins look like a low-20% range, if my math is correct. I mean, with the productivity flowing in, is the dollar level of productivity in future years going to be as strong as this year?\nPeter Jackson: Well, it\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re shooting for. Internally, we have a lot of projects that we think we can leverage to continue to improve our operations, continue to offset the impact of inflation, whether it be the way we buy, what we buy, how we deliver it, how we process it internally, back office, those are all things that we\u2019re pretty confident that we can continue to improve, and those are the goals we\u2019re setting for ourselves. Will every year be exactly this year or better, well, we\u2019ll see certainly where we\u2019re headed.\nDave Rush: We believe there\u2019s a huge opportunity there given our platform of the 570-plus locations and our ability to take best practices from -- we\u2019re a product of multiple acquisitions. And we\u2019ve learned how to take the best practice from one of those acquisitions and leverage it across the platform. We\u2019ve built a continuous improvement culture. We have people dedicated to it in each of our divisions for that very purpose, because we believe that the part -- the benefit of our scale is to be able to do it the best way across 570 locations versus just in one area or one market. So, we\u2019re confident that we can achieve at the current levels of continuous improvement that we\u2019ve set for ourselves each year for a long period in the future.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay, helpful. And then to make sure on the productivity savings, how much of that is coming from the distribution side of the business? How much of that is more on the manufacturing side? And maybe how much of that is automation driven versus other general improvements?\nDave Rush: Yes. So, it\u2019s probably half and half in terms of what we\u2019re getting on the sort of the inbound versus the operating sides. We\u2019re doing a lot in both with a bunch of individual projects that sort of accumulate to contribute. But directionally, it\u2019s probably right.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: I just wanted to -- just based on the visibility you may have into your inventory and your Multi-Family backlogs for this quarter. Just maybe any help on the phasing of the gross margin and even just the overall sales and EBITDA third quarter versus fourth quarter?\nPeter Jackson: Well, I think normally, we would perform a bit lower in the fourth quarter just as a seasonal representation. Qs 2 and 3 are always better than Qs 1 and 4. This year, and I think it\u2019s based on what I said before, we think it\u2019s likely to be more normal. So, we would expect Q4 to be a bit weaker. Certainly, as always, that\u2019s the weaker part of my forecasting confidence it\u2019s one quarter out, we feel pretty good; two quarters out, gets a little more murky. So maybe the right way to think about it.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Understood. And then on the inventory balance, that\u2019s come down as commodity costs have come down and rolled through the P&L. But is there additional productivity you\u2019re looking to gain on the inventory balances, or given what we\u2019ve seen in the market, could we actually see it go the other way where you\u2019re preparing, I guess, for a stronger spring in 2024, making sure that you have inventory on hand to service the market?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, probably more the latter. So I\u2019ll start by saying your observation is absolutely correct. We\u2019ve had great performance. Operating teams have done a fantastic job of sort of continuing to clean up post the craziness of the supply chain over the last couple of years, clearing out excess that we feel we had on hand tightening up, whether it be windows or millwork or whatever, the teams have done a great job of really managing on -- in a very streamlined just-in-time way, the inventory that we\u2019ve got rolling in and out of our facilities. But you\u2019re right. When we grow, we absolutely have more working capital inventory included. So, coming into the future where we do see, at least based on what we\u2019re seeing right now, growth on the horizon, we would expect working capital to stop being a tailwind and start being the usage into that group.\nOperator: The next question comes from Collin Verron with Jefferies.\nCollin Verron: You\u2019ve highlighted the acceleration in orders from the public builders and the Census Bureau data really bouncing off the bottom here. I was just hoping you guys could talk about any differences you\u2019re seeing between your customers with the large production builders and the smaller builders. And then a comment on this -- at this point, do you see the bottom in Single-Family being behind BLDR at this point, particularly from a Single-Family sales perspective?\nDave Rush: Well, we were certainly really encouraged by both the results that our public builders were reporting and even more about the projections for the rest of the year. So, we feel really confident that -- again, I\u2019m not calling this robust, but it\u2019s certainly better than everyone expected over the second half of the year and stable to up over the back half of the year. And that gave us the confidence that we have for being able to project what we feel like we can do in that environment.\nCollin Verron: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then you guys provided some good color on the digital adoption, providing some takeoff figures. Can you just quantify those maybe in terms of revenues and talk about where you guys are in your journey in reaching that $1 billion sales opportunity?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. We\u2019re excited about digital. It\u2019s continuing to move along. The technology is coming together. The pilots are going well and we\u2019ve given sort of a few hints about some metrics and what that looks like internally but it\u2019s all very, very early days, to be honest. We\u2019ve got some revenue, but it\u2019s pretty modest. It\u2019s not the focus. The focus is not really growing that right now. It\u2019s tuning. It\u2019s completing the technology, tuning what we have built, making sure the technology is sort of stable and capable of running at the scale that we intend to put through it. That\u2019s this year\u2019s goal. We\u2019re certainly expecting pretty significant increases in \u201824 and beyond. And we\u2019ll have some more information on the timing of that and the layout of that as we get into our Investor Day in December.\nOperator: The next question comes from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner: Congrats again on the strong quarter. I guess, I had some connection issues earlier. So, if I repeat anything, sorry, in advance. But first question is on inventory. Can you talk about where your inventory stands from a volume perspective relative to kind of historically normal times? We\u2019ve heard from both kind of two-step distributors and some manufacturers that the dealer channel is kind of thin and hesitant to add. I was just curious how you guys are viewing inventory? Is that something where you\u2019re stocking and it\u2019s an advantage you have product over some of your smaller peers, or are you the folks that are running thinner than usual now?\nDave Rush: I would say we\u2019re running normal, right? I think we\u2019re not seeing the same kind of supply challenges we did just after COVID. It\u2019s more of a normal operating environment. Our guys have done an unbelievable job of coming through that and getting back to normal for us. We\u2019re where we would be normally with just seasonal fluctuations now. So we\u2019ll see a buildup of inventory during the third quarter, and it will start to wane in the fourth quarter as we head into the seasonal months. But we\u2019re kind of business as usual at this point.\nReuben Garner: Okay, great. And then,, I\u2019m not sure if this one was asked, but an updated way to think about sensitivity to lumber? I know you\u2019ve got the base business lumber out there. But if we\u2019re continuing to run $100 higher, how much of an impact does that have on revenue and profit?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. That\u2019s a good question, Reuben. You may have noticed we brought back the base business guidance and estimate, but we did not bring back that sensitivity chart in the back. Candidly, I think that caused as much confusion as clarity. So, we\u2019re going to try a different approach. What I can tell you, and this is really based on what we\u2019re seeing today, if lumber goes up or down by $100, $1,000, we think it\u2019s worth between $175 million and $225 million in annual EBITDA. So, it\u2019s -- if I use 200 as the midpoint, it\u2019s in that range, but there are two things that I need you to just keep in mind, right? There are a number of assumptions that go into that type of rule of thumb metric. The two most important are: one, that\u2019s assuming normalized margins. It\u2019s a normalized margin impact of that up and down specific to commodities. And then, please keep in mind, it takes three, four months, sometimes a little bit longer of lag before that change in commodity will show up in our results, right? You think about the inventory on the ground, the order time, the delivery and then the pricing change impact as that flows through. So, just keep in mind, those two assumptions are very critical to that, that rule of thumb. But again, $100 lumber worth between $175 million and $225 million of annual EBITDA.\nReuben Garner: And a quick clarification, Peter. Is that lumber and OSB altogether commodity?\nPeter Jackson: Correct. And we assume a 70-30 lumber OSB mix.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.\nKurt Yinger: Just given the strength in value-add and what you\u2019ve talked about in terms of, I guess, the widening kind of margin differential versus traditional distributed products. Are you seeing competitors, I guess, invest behind the category to a greater extent or lean in more there? And I guess, over the long term, how do you think about your ability to kind of differentiate with some of those solutions?\nDave Rush: Yes. I think we\u2019re the clear leader in the space, first of all. And we have made the most -- we\u2019ve put the most emphasis on finding ways to increase our productivity, specifically in our manufacturing truss and door shops to extend that lead. We believe the investment required to do those type of improvements is not insignificant. And we\u2019re -- we believe our commitment to us has made a difference. And we see that in the marketplace. We especially saw it coming out of COVID, where it was tough for people to find a truss manufacturer that wasn\u2019t -- that didn\u2019t have a significant backlog and people had to pick and choose who they wanted to do business with. And we saw where our customers wanted to do business with us in that environment. So, we feel good about our position. I think anywhere where you see opportunity, people are going to make investment. I just think we\u2019ve got such a nice lead on our competition today, it will be tough for us -- for them to catch us.\nKurt Yinger: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just second, I was hoping you could just kind of frame how you would characterize your volume performance over the first half relative to what we\u2019ve seen on the Single-Family start side. And I guess in manufactured products as well, I mean it seems like the core organic sales there trailed Single-Family starts a bit. Curious if that\u2019s footprint, maybe some pricing in there and just how you\u2019d kind of reconcile those different data points.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. No, that\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s something we look at pretty regularly, as you know. What I think it boils down to most simply is starts are the best indicator and the best sort of measuring stick for our performance over time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate at a quarter. And what we\u2019ve seen is sort of as the market turned down, we didn\u2019t go down as much as the market. As the market has turned up, we haven\u2019t gone up as much as the market. And there\u2019s a little bit of product mix to do with that, right? We\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re probably two-thirds that\u2019s leveraged towards the beginning of the start, one-third towards the end of the start. So that\u2019s one piece. Another of it is that we\u2019re probably not at the start. We know we\u2019re not at the start. We\u2019re anywhere from 30, sometimes 60 days later when our first product starts to hit the job site. So, a little bit of shifting around that in terms of timing of when our orders hit. Based on the trends we\u2019re seeing right now, we feel pretty good. We may have given up a little bit of share in our estimation, a couple of hundred million dollars worth. We talked a lot during the time line of the big supply chain disruptions about how advantaged we thought we were by having more product and being more effective at meeting customer needs where others struggle. And we\u2019re probably giving back a little bit of that as we anticipated, but that\u2019s kind of in the numbers you\u2019re seeing now. So, feeling pretty good about where we are versus the overall market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: The first question I had, we\u2019ve seen lumber prices, especially framing lumber, move up sequentially for the last couple of months. I guess, is that starting to flow into your pricing not only on commodity goods, but are you also starting to be able to take some price on the value-add goods?\nPeter Jackson: Like always, yes, sure. I mean, it will take some time to fully feather in, but it has started to move modestly and we certainly follow it on a consistent basis. The one point I\u2019ll make on that though is that one of the big movers has been OSB. I\u2019m personally a little bit skeptical on the durability of that, only because we hear so much about incremental capacity coming online over the next year. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see where it pans out, but that certainly is something to keep an eye on.\nJay McCanless: Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. And then just the second question, M&A phrased a different way. Are you starting to see some of this tightening in terms of bank lending standards and underwriting on some of your potential acquisition targets? Is that freeing up or making some people may be more willing to sell than they might have been at the beginning of the year?\nDave Rush: That makes reasonable sense that we would start to see that. I would say what we\u2019ve been looking at lately, that hasn\u2019t been a factor.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey with Baird.\nQuinn Fredrickson: Yes. Hi. This is Quinn Fredrickson on for Dave. I\u2019ll just ask one question here. Peter, your earlier comment made it sound like the competitive environment has remained pretty benign in value-add and better than you expected. Do you think that\u2019s due to same dynamic among competitors with the commodity price lags in their contracts, or is there a structural change and improvement there? And then, are you assuming an uptick in competitiveness and the expectations for the slight back half gross margin moderation?\nPeter Jackson: So, I guess, I need to be a little careful how I answer that. On the first hand, we have seen incremental competition and margin erosion in core business, period, full stop. Now, it\u2019s not as much as we expected. It\u2019s not as much as we forecasted, hence the outperformance in that area. I would say that there\u2019s been a lot of strength in the volumes within the value-add, which gives us increasing confidence that we\u2019re meeting a need that our customers see value in it, that they\u2019re leveraging it to improve their cycle times, their job site efficiencies, their job site safety and that we\u2019re at a price point that\u2019s competitive that allows them to do what they need to do better. So, we\u2019re certainly pleased with all of that and have been seeing the competition. Now, the components of cost, the investments that we\u2019ve made, but also the inflation we\u2019ve seen, certainly, I think that has had a structural impact on the overall market, us included, but others as well, where you got to make a little more gross margin if you want to cover those incremental wage costs or truck costs or whatever it is. But then lastly, we\u2019ve done a lot of work. We\u2019re much more efficient and that self-help has allowed us to earn more on the same equipment year-on-year because of our efficiency improvements, whether it be new automation that layers on the same equipment and facilities, sometimes it\u2019s a new equipment, but sometimes it\u2019s just better process. And all of those things are why that strength we\u2019ve seen is sustainable. I think that helps to Dave\u2019s point, us be more competitive, right? We can still make good money where others are struggling. And if we can do it by being more reliable or on time and in-full being better that our quality is better, then we\u2019re always going to be the partner of choice for these builders who want to make sure their houses are high quality and on time.\nDave Rush: And I would just add a real-life example. In a major market we had a customer try someone else for 50 houses on truss for a lower price. They came back to us less than a month later at our price for those same 50 houses, which we, by the way, delivered inside of 10 days. So, the stickiness we generated or by being able to do what we do best for our customers, they recognize that value proposition. And that\u2019s allowed us to make money for them and us, and that\u2019s where we want to be.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional closing remarks.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you very much. Have a great day.\nDave Rush: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Rush",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Entering 2023, we prepared for a challenging and dynamic year. During the first half, we had better than anticipated performance, driven by the strength of our value-added product portfolio, continued outperformance in Multi-Family, and a more stable housing environment than originally projected. Multi-Family is an area we identified as providing strong growth potential and in market diversification over the long term. We are truly seeing the differentiated platform we have put together over the past few years generate results. We continue to exceed our near-term targets through contributions from operational initiatives instill over the last few years, and by executing our strategic priorities, which is a testament to the unwavering commitment and dedication of our amazing team members. We are focused on delivering exceptional customer service and always strive to be the easiest company in the industry to do business with. We're driving mixed improvement through value added share growth, while continuing to expand through tuck-in acquisitions. Our acquisitions in recent years have allowed us to enhance our value-added offerings and also extend our reach to a more diverse customer base in attractive markets. Moreover, these acquisitions have proven to be immediately accretive to our earnings. We continue to consistently generate robust free cash flow and prudently deploy capital, making two tuck-in acquisitions and repurchasing over $700 million of shares in the second quarter alone. Despite the headwinds posed by elevated mortgage rates and affordability challenges, our resilient results in the first half of 2023 give us confidence that we have the right strategies in place with a customer-centric approach and an incredible team that is executing at the highest level to successfully navigate this dynamic economic environment. Many single-family builders are showing stabilizing demand partially due to widespread shortages of existing homes for sale, driving healthy new construction. Public builders have been reporting a stream of stronger-than-expected results and taking proactive steps, such as interest rate buy-downs to help get prospective buyers off the sidelines. With home prices normalizing in many places, our focus on value-added solutions, digital innovations and customer service is helping builders improve their construction efficiencies. We are helping our customers lower cycle time, which is highlighted by our continued improvement on in full deliveries from 93% last year to 96%, during the second quarter. On time and in full deliveries ensure our customers have the right material at the right time. Looking at our second quarter highlights on slide 4. Our gross margin percentage increased 40 basis points to 35.2% due to stronger mix in value-added products overall, largely driven by our Multi-Family segment and the related positive impact from commodity cost timing. We maintained a healthy double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin, showcasing our ability to execute effectively from an operations perspective in a challenging environment. This execution is a reflection of our talented field leadership team, which averages 30-plus years of industry experience. Turning to slide 5. We drove strong productivity across the business by delivering $50 million in savings during the quarter. Our BFS One Team Operating System continues to generate robust efficiencies, focused on manufacturing and delivery improvement. Our recent acquisitions in Multi-Family contributed an increase of 4% on the top-line and 9% to EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter. Multi-Family was an exceptionally strong tailwind this quarter, and we expect this streak to continue for the remainder of 2023. While we expect Multi-Family to normalize around the first or second quarter of next year, we remain optimistic that, Single-Family starts will be on stronger footing in the same period, compared to the first half of 2023. As it relates to our cost structure, controlling SG&A and other expenses remains a vital focus for us. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for variable cost reductions against future capacity needs. We are focused on our discretionary spending, and our team has done a great job on managing costs in the short-term, while executing our strategy over the long-term. Turning to M&A on slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities with a disciplined approach. Thus far in 2023, we have completed four deals and are still committed to our goal of investing an average of $500 million in M&A per year for the next several years. During the second quarter, we added millwork capabilities through the acquisitions of JB Millworks and Builders Millwork Supply. And earlier this week, we acquired Church's Lumber, which expands our presence and scale in the Detroit market. We're excited to welcome our talented new team members to the BFS family. Our M&A and organic investments have substantially increased our value-added product mix and diversified our end markets since Q4 2021, as shown on slide 6. We have seen the fruit of this growth in recent quarters, and we have driven our gross margins higher even in a down housing starts environment. Moving to slide 7. I would like to provide an update on capital allocation. In the second quarter, we deployed over $850 million of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $5.3 billion since the end of 2021 and remain on track to achieve our 2025 goal of $7 billion to $10 billion communicated at our Investor Day in 2021. Now let's turn to slide 8 for an update on our digital strategy. We firmly believe our long-term commitment to new digital innovations and technologies will deliver greater efficiency across homebuilding and enhance our product and service offerings. We continue to play a pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry and have made a significant investment in growing our digital platform. We have made it a priority to ensure digital adoption is integrated across our operations as we seek to create a platform that will lead to building better, more affordable homes. myBLDR.com serves as the entry point to our collaborative project management platform. It is designed to create efficiency for both BFS and our customers by offering improved transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. It combines Paradigm's next-generation estimating technology with our 3D Home Configuration model. Together, these tools allow our customers more control over their design, cost estimating and building process ultimately saving both our customers and their clients, time and money. We are still in early innings and have more to come as we continue to roll out these digital solutions to our end users but we remain confident in our ability to gain an incremental $1 billion in product sales by 2026. We believe our sustained commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies will extend BFS' lead as the partner of choice in the market, and we look forward to providing more detail on our long-term strategy at our Investor Day in December. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I want to say how grateful I am to our team members for continuing to execute in a challenging environment and providing excellent service to our customers on a daily basis. At BFS, we keep our high-performing, people-first culture at the heart of all we do. That's why we like to recognize team members in our organization that embody the true spirit of our, Be More, Do More, Build More together philosophy. Perla Jover is an Inventory Control Supervisor in Houston, Texas, who has made a huge impression on her managers and colleagues. In May, she was honored as one of our first team MVPs for exemplifying our core values. Perla's attitude -- positive attitude for willingness to jump in and help in her pursuit of excellence really makes a difference on the team. The supervisors appreciate how she embraces learning new skills and mentoring others, especially young women new to our industry. Employees like Pearl make me proud to lead this great organization. Without the full effort of our team, we would not have had the outperformance that we achieved during the first half of this year. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Thanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we feel better about the current building environment today than we did at the beginning of the year. We're executing our strategy and continuing to invest to drive future growth. Our results in the first half reflect our hard work over the past few years to build a differentiated platform that has BFS set up to win in any environment. I am proud of our operational excellence, which is driving increased safety, productivity and profitability despite market headwinds. We are in a great position today and as end markets further stabilize, we are positioned for an even stronger future. We'll continue to be at the forefront of technology with our digital strategy, which I'm confident will be a game changer for the industry. We are exceptionally well positioned to drive shareholder value this year and in years to come. I'm excited to share more details at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5th in Atlanta and look forward to seeing you there. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. Hey Matt, thanks again. This is Dave. I would just add, since the merger with BMC, we've invested over $100 million in upgrading and automating our manufacturing capabilities, and we're starting to see the fruits of that. And we're getting a better feel of how that's going to contribute to margins over the longer period as well. Thanks, Trey. I appreciate it. Yes. We are seeing evidence from our customers that at the tail end of this year, there's going to be a lot of supply that comes online all at around the same time. And that in a typical year would have to be digested before a lot of these other new projects come online. That's one factor. The other factor is the cost of capital. And being able to make sure that the rents that they're going to generate versus the cost of capital, that equation has to work out exactly right as well. And until some of that -- or some of that glut of openings that comes online at the end of the year, it gets digested. Those kind of dynamics have a little bit of time to work themselves out. So, what we're hearing is there might be a little bit of a delay in the first and second quarter and then things start picking back up again. The problem, as you know, is these projects are so long in time from plan to execution that we feel like there's going to be a lag in the first half of next year. But overall, we believe the Multi-Family will be a great segment for us to be in, and it will be a temporary scenario, not necessarily something long term that we got to worry about. Yes. I would tell you, we feel really good about the level of automation we have where every plant has some level of automation. Obviously, there's more opportunity, and we have a pretty long runway there to continue to improve, and we're excited about that prioritizing those projects. And as you know, as we do acquisitions, typically, there's a level of automation that we go back in and upgrade those acquisitions with and we'll have that plan ongoing. We're a good customer for our automation vendor. And as much as we're always excited about talking about digital, we're also on our front foot when it comes to technology in this manufacturing space as well. So yes, we're excited about where this can continue to go. Thanks for the question. Yes, the M&A pipeline actually has improved. I think just the fact that things were changing at the beginning of the year and people weren't sure exactly how the year was going to play out, kept people on the sideline for the first half. We're seeing more opportunities now in the second half and a couple that we feel like are really good to look at. And we're excited about how we'll continue to invest in M&A in the future. Yes. I think the supply chain has normalized to a great extent. I think -- versus when you saw the COVID-related issues, we're not seeing anything of that magnitude out there. There's a couple of product categories where lead times are or slightly extended, premium windows is an example, but still, things are normalizing. Now, with the uptick in demand, there is some adjustments by a lot of our vendor partners on staffing and getting staff back up to the new normal of demand, but those look to be very temporary and very slight. So, I would say, all in all, from a supply chain perspective, we're in pretty good shape. Yes. I would just add. We were purposeful when we added that acquisition and entrants into that Multi-Family segment, knowing that it would be a diversification play from Single-Family and vice versa. So, what we're expecting is as Multi-Family normalizes, we're expecting Single-Family to remain on stable footing. In addition, in the truss world, what makes it so -- such a good investment for us is we can run Single-Family jobs out of a Multi-Family truss plan. So, we do that today. When we have Multi-Family plants that are maxed out, we run Multi-Family jobs out of our Single-Family plants and vice versa, when each side has more work than they have capacity. So, we've got a plan in place to manage through all ebbs and flows of both sides of those businesses and we did so intentionally. We believe there's a huge opportunity there given our platform of the 570-plus locations and our ability to take best practices from -- we're a product of multiple acquisitions. And we've learned how to take the best practice from one of those acquisitions and leverage it across the platform. We've built a continuous improvement culture. We have people dedicated to it in each of our divisions for that very purpose, because we believe that the part -- the benefit of our scale is to be able to do it the best way across 570 locations versus just in one area or one market. So, we're confident that we can achieve at the current levels of continuous improvement that we've set for ourselves each year for a long period in the future. Yes. So, it's probably half and half in terms of what we're getting on the sort of the inbound versus the operating sides. We're doing a lot in both with a bunch of individual projects that sort of accumulate to contribute. But directionally, it's probably right. Well, we were certainly really encouraged by both the results that our public builders were reporting and even more about the projections for the rest of the year. So, we feel really confident that -- again, I'm not calling this robust, but it's certainly better than everyone expected over the second half of the year and stable to up over the back half of the year. And that gave us the confidence that we have for being able to project what we feel like we can do in that environment. I would say we're running normal, right? I think we're not seeing the same kind of supply challenges we did just after COVID. It's more of a normal operating environment. Our guys have done an unbelievable job of coming through that and getting back to normal for us. We're where we would be normally with just seasonal fluctuations now. So we'll see a buildup of inventory during the third quarter, and it will start to wane in the fourth quarter as we head into the seasonal months. But we're kind of business as usual at this point. Yes. I think we're the clear leader in the space, first of all. And we have made the most -- we've put the most emphasis on finding ways to increase our productivity, specifically in our manufacturing truss and door shops to extend that lead. We believe the investment required to do those type of improvements is not insignificant. And we're -- we believe our commitment to us has made a difference. And we see that in the marketplace. We especially saw it coming out of COVID, where it was tough for people to find a truss manufacturer that wasn't -- that didn't have a significant backlog and people had to pick and choose who they wanted to do business with. And we saw where our customers wanted to do business with us in that environment. So, we feel good about our position. I think anywhere where you see opportunity, people are going to make investment. I just think we've got such a nice lead on our competition today, it will be tough for us -- for them to catch us. That makes reasonable sense that we would start to see that. I would say what we've been looking at lately, that hasn't been a factor. And I would just add a real-life example. In a major market we had a customer try someone else for 50 houses on truss for a lower price. They came back to us less than a month later at our price for those same 50 houses, which we, by the way, delivered inside of 10 days. So, the stickiness we generated or by being able to do what we do best for our customers, they recognize that value proposition. And that's allowed us to make money for them and us, and that's where we want to be. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our performance during the quarter further highlighted the resilience of our business in the face of macro pressures. I'm particularly proud of our gross margin results driven by our increased mix of value-added products and services. We are well positioned in the marketplace with differentiated solutions and a healthy balance sheet. We continue to generate robust free cash flow and prudently deploy capital. I'm confident that the combination of our industry-leading scale, ongoing investments in value-added and digital products, and strong financial position will lead to a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year, and sustained growth in the years to come. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our second quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our full year 2023 guidance. Let's begin by reviewing our second quarter performance on slide 10. We delivered $4.5 billion in net sales. Core organic sales decreased by 22%, which was better than expected, despite a 31% decline in Single-Family due to slower demand over the prior year. Multi-Family continues to be a bright spot, growing by nearly 30%. As Dave mentioned, the strength in Multi-Family was driven by our recent acquisitions as well as favorable margins, largely attributable to the longer lead time for this end market. R&R and other grew by nearly 5%, mainly due to increased sales focus and capacity versus the prior year. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 4 percentage points of growth to net sales. Importantly, value-added products represented 53% of our net sales this quarter versus 45% in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting our improving position as a supplier of choice for these higher-margin products. During the second quarter, gross profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 33.9% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 40 basis points to 35.2%, driven primarily by a stronger mix in value-added products overall and with particular strength in Multi-Family value-add. SG&A decreased $28 million to $1.02 billion, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $52 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 740 basis points to 22.5%, primarily attributable to decreased leverage on net sales. We remain focused on operating efficiently, containing costs and effectively integrating operations and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $769 million, a decline of 49%, primarily driven by lower net sales, including a decline in core organic products attributable to a slower housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained a robust 17%, up 70 basis points sequentially as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income was $498 million, down from an adjusted net income of $1.07 billion in the prior year quarter. The 54% decrease in adjusted net income was primarily driven by a decrease in sales volumes and commodity deflation. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $3.89 compared to $6.26 in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EPS was partially offset by our repurchase of nearly 7 million shares, which added roughly $0.20 per share during quarter. Our second quarter results exceeded the guidance we provided in May, supported by our core business mix and gross margin strength amid outperformance in value-added products. We continue to gain confidence in the strength and durability of our margin performance, and we believe our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 29%-plus versus our previous expectation of 28%-plus. Now, let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on slide 12. Our second quarter operating cash flow was approximately $391 million, down $556 million compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a reduction in Single-Family starts. Capital expenditures were $121 million. All in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $270 million. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30, our free cash flow yield was 17.7%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 41.4%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1 times, while base business leverage was 1.6 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $900 million, consisting of $800 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $100 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares for $723 million at an average stock price of $103.68 per share. In total, we have repurchased approximately 41% of our outstanding shares since August of 2021. We have approximately $s600 million remaining on our most recent $1 million share repurchase authorization from April 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital, and we'll continue to look for organic and inorganic growth opportunities while maintaining our fortress balance sheet. Let's turn to our outlook on slide 14. Our July sales trends are encouraging and fuel our confidence in the resilience of our industry. Several of our national customers have begun to provide full year guidance, providing us with better visibility and greater confidence in the strength of the market. As a result, we are establishing our full year base business and total company guidance as we enter the back half of 2023. Our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing for commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized margins and static commodity prices at $400 per 1,000 board feet. This is helpful to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance in our industry. Our base business guide on net sales is $16.6 billion. Our base business EBITDA guide is $2.2 billion at a margin of roughly 13.3%. At this time, we are also providing total company guidance for full year 2023, including total net sales, gross margins, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. For full year 2023, we expect total company net sales to be $16.8 billion to $17.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 15% to 17%. And we are guiding gross margins to a range of 33% to 35%. Our recent above normal margins reflected greater mix in value-added products along with disciplined pricing required to offset our increases in operating costs from inflation. As we move through the second half of the year, we expect both our gross margins and Multi-Family business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2023 free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. Our free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $450. Our 2023 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and slide 15 of the investor presentation for a full list of these assumptions. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are exceptionally well positioned to drive our strategic goals. Our guidance illustrates our belief that we will deliver a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year and sustain that momentum in the years to come. As we continue to reap the benefits of our transformed business, we are positioned to achieve an upwardly revised long-term normalized gross margin of 29% or higher. I'm confident that our best-in-class operating platform will continue to generate substantial free cash flow, providing further financial flexibility on top of our already healthy balance sheet. Importantly, we will continue to diligently deploy capital and maximize long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts. Well, first of all, thanks, Matt. We appreciate it. We're excited about the business and certainly pleased with the way gross margins have been continuing to evolve. We've talked about it for -- well, a couple of years now, actually. The strength of the core business, particularly post merger and what we've been able to do to grow value-add as a mix of our business has been very impactful. And what we've continued to look for, particularly this year, is the normalization, right, with the supply chain getting back to normal, the reset and the level of starts, we were really concerned about what that would mean in terms of the overall market's ability to sustain margins. I don't think we were alone in that. What we've looked for this year is the performance being at a stable level. And while we're not quite there yet, we've certainly seen stability be established in a lot of parts of the market, a lot of regions, a lot of product categories where we've seen things sort of get to normal and level out. When we talk about gross margins, it can be a little bit misleading. Again, this quarter, we saw a substantial tailwind due to Multi-Family, what I would describe as sort of transitory tailwinds. At least a couple of hundred basis points this quarter was really just due to the way the commodity timing, the cost of commodities played out versus some of our contracts. So, we're pleased with it. Obviously, we'll take it. But we don't want to signal to anybody that that's permanent. And we still have certain areas of the market where things continue to normalize, and we're not quite sure where things will end up, but we know the pressure is down. We've certainly seen that. We're up 40 bps overall on gross margins. But certainly, that indicates if you take out Multi-Family, some pretty decent step-down in the core, that's what we thought was going to happen, and that's pretty much how it's played out, and we'll continue to look for that. But even with all of that said, it's better than we expected. We certainly have gained a lot of confidence in the strength of our business, the strength of value-add, which continues to be really, really desirable for our builder customers, and we're continuing to invest in it and feel good about what that means for normal margins going forward. We'll continue to monitor it. I mean, we've left the plus at the end because we think -- obviously, we're performing better than that now, and we're just going to wait and see where things normalize over time. Yes. No, good question, Matt. So just a basic reminder, the base business is really just trying to take out any commodity fluctuation in two ways, right? Anything that's not $400 lumber we normalize for, and we also normalize for margins attributable to those same commodities. So we don't normalize for margins anywhere else, but it does have the impact within that $600 million that you mentioned that yes, there's some rounding. Within that $600 million that you mentioned, that's attributable to margins. And this particular year, it's mostly margins. So, the vast majority of what has flowed through is the normalization of those outperforming margins over the course of the year. There is certainly a component of that that is from the Multi-Family, right? So it's because a piece of the commodities flows into our manufactured products, including roofing, floor, trusses as well as wall panels, which obviously have a significant component of commodity in them. So, we take an adjustment for that. So, that is the primary driver is the margins attributable to the commodity change this year. Yes. No, good question. So, we continue to see -- again, it goes to the countervailing trends. We continue to see some erosion in the core market gross margin, less than we expected, but it has continued, and I think we'll continue to see that through the back half of this year. And then we know pretty -- with pretty reasonable accuracy how Multi-Family will play out just because of the timing of the contracts that were related to the current purchase price of commodities and kind of where we're at. So, we've got a pretty decent look. Certainly, there's been good performance in gross margins throughout the year, and I don't think July is significantly different, but the trends remain the same with the overlay of Multi-Family's normalization being pretty significant over the next year. Yes. It's been a -- I don't know how to describe it other than refreshing year. For all of the concerns that we came into the year with due to interest rates, due to affordability, it has been a surprisingly and refreshingly normal year. We see good progression throughout the year, the normal seasonality that we would expect to see with busier months in the summer. We've seen good utilization of our capacity. Nothing's been overwhelmed. We've gotten quite busy in certain areas, but nothing has been catastrophic like during the big run around COVID. Same on behalf of our vendors, they've performed very well. Few spots here and there where it's gotten a little tight, but by and large, the market has adjusted to the new volumes and really sold through quite well. And as we alluded to with our customer base, there's confidence in a lot of areas with regard to how consistently they've been able to sell through what they've been building. It seems pretty obvious that the demand is still out there. And with the reluctance to move out of an existing home, new construction has really been a bright spot, and we're excited to be leaning into that quite well. Yes. So R&R, the way we service R&R, there are a few markets where we're very focused on it with specific cases. But for the most part, we serve both the Pro new construction and the Pro R&R markets through the same chance. So, you end up with certain time lines where you've got pretty heavy demand from one or the other. And obviously, over the past couple of years, the bulk of it has come from the new construction side. So with that pullback a bit, they just opened up more capacity, that Pro R&R business. And as I said in the past, the Pro R&R contractor would generally prefer to use us if we're available because of all the incremental services and expertise we provide versus a traditional big box or a small player. The categories, the product categories, I would say we performed well across the outline of products or the family of products within Pro R&R. I would say, just stepping back for the whole business, we've continued to see really nice performance in the windows, doors and millwork category. That's been an outperformer for us all year, and we're pretty excited about that. Yes. Yes. No, your point is right on. We've had a lot of change in that Multi-Family category. We've invested a lot, and we've been very successful, even in the core business in terms of how we've competed in the marketplace. I think that the overall impact of our kind of leaning into this has been a big change in the market and a big change for us. So it's increased that Multi-Family mix, but it's a mix that's attributable largely to truss, right? So we're not in sky scrapers. We're not in shopping malls or certain large-scale apartment complexes, right? We're in four-storey and below wood frame structures. That's sort of our operating arena and our sweet spot. That has been doing remarkably well. And I think we have been able to improve our positioning in the market and be seen as a serious, reliable competitor. We've got the ability to withstand sort of ebbs and flows. We can be counted on to deliver even if there are some capacity constraints through our network of facilities around the country. So, we do think we've gained share. We do -- we know we bought share, and we think that that has all sort of come together to really give us some nice momentum. And that momentum is true, even though we're really in the middle of integration. So, this is still early days for us in terms of getting all those teams to work together. So, we're really excited about what the future holds. Now, you are right about the reset. We think that as we get into probably back half of next year, when we're seeing things normalize, maybe beyond that, it's probably closer to 10% directionally, we'll dial that in for you, but it's probably 10% of sales in an environment like we're in today in a normal world. Yes. So, if you think about the historical kind of guidances that we've had, we were running -- we were running gross margins kind of 25% to 27%. We talked about how the commodities were generally kind of high-teens to low-20s for gross margins. We talked about how value-add was 800 to 1,000 basis points higher than that. I would tell you kind of where we are today with some of the noise in it. We're substantially higher than that on the value-add. But we've also seen sort of increases across the board. The increases across the board we talked about a lot, just to reiterate, we've seen some inflation, right? So if the cost of delivery is higher, the margins need to be higher in order to pay for the increased costs. So, we've seen some incremental margin increase across the board to cover that. And then, the two things that have impacted it the most is you've seen increased productivity. And what we've talked about in Multi-Family, some displacement causing the margins to be higher, full stop. And you've seen overall a pretty substantial mix shift away from the commodity side of the business, which used to be half of what we did back in the old days to closer to 25 to a third -- 25% to a third of our business now and that has allowed that normalized gross margin to really drift further and further up the more our mix swings. So, sort of all of those components are feeding in the productivity, the inflation, the overall mix shift to allow us to see that higher amount. But again, going from 35%, 34% for the full year is what we're signaling, right, for the midpoint, down to the 29%-plus that is the Multi-Family. That is the continued normalization. And we're going to continue to watch that play out, and we'll dial in that guidance as we get more confident. Well, it's certainly what we're shooting for. Internally, we have a lot of projects that we think we can leverage to continue to improve our operations, continue to offset the impact of inflation, whether it be the way we buy, what we buy, how we deliver it, how we process it internally, back office, those are all things that we're pretty confident that we can continue to improve, and those are the goals we're setting for ourselves. Will every year be exactly this year or better, well, we'll see certainly where we're headed. Well, I think normally, we would perform a bit lower in the fourth quarter just as a seasonal representation. Qs 2 and 3 are always better than Qs 1 and 4. This year, and I think it's based on what I said before, we think it's likely to be more normal. So, we would expect Q4 to be a bit weaker. Certainly, as always, that's the weaker part of my forecasting confidence it's one quarter out, we feel pretty good; two quarters out, gets a little more murky. So maybe the right way to think about it. Yes, probably more the latter. So I'll start by saying your observation is absolutely correct. We've had great performance. Operating teams have done a fantastic job of sort of continuing to clean up post the craziness of the supply chain over the last couple of years, clearing out excess that we feel we had on hand tightening up, whether it be windows or millwork or whatever, the teams have done a great job of really managing on -- in a very streamlined just-in-time way, the inventory that we've got rolling in and out of our facilities. But you're right. When we grow, we absolutely have more working capital inventory included. So, coming into the future where we do see, at least based on what we're seeing right now, growth on the horizon, we would expect working capital to stop being a tailwind and start being the usage into that group. Yes. We're excited about digital. It's continuing to move along. The technology is coming together. The pilots are going well and we've given sort of a few hints about some metrics and what that looks like internally but it's all very, very early days, to be honest. We've got some revenue, but it's pretty modest. It's not the focus. The focus is not really growing that right now. It's tuning. It's completing the technology, tuning what we have built, making sure the technology is sort of stable and capable of running at the scale that we intend to put through it. That's this year's goal. We're certainly expecting pretty significant increases in \u201824 and beyond. And we'll have some more information on the timing of that and the layout of that as we get into our Investor Day in December. Yes. That's a good question, Reuben. You may have noticed we brought back the base business guidance and estimate, but we did not bring back that sensitivity chart in the back. Candidly, I think that caused as much confusion as clarity. So, we're going to try a different approach. What I can tell you, and this is really based on what we're seeing today, if lumber goes up or down by $100, $1,000, we think it's worth between $175 million and $225 million in annual EBITDA. So, it's -- if I use 200 as the midpoint, it's in that range, but there are two things that I need you to just keep in mind, right? There are a number of assumptions that go into that type of rule of thumb metric. The two most important are: one, that's assuming normalized margins. It's a normalized margin impact of that up and down specific to commodities. And then, please keep in mind, it takes three, four months, sometimes a little bit longer of lag before that change in commodity will show up in our results, right? You think about the inventory on the ground, the order time, the delivery and then the pricing change impact as that flows through. So, just keep in mind, those two assumptions are very critical to that, that rule of thumb. But again, $100 lumber worth between $175 million and $225 million of annual EBITDA. Correct. And we assume a 70-30 lumber OSB mix. Yes. No, that's a fair question. It's something we look at pretty regularly, as you know. What I think it boils down to most simply is starts are the best indicator and the best sort of measuring stick for our performance over time. I don't think it's accurate at a quarter. And what we've seen is sort of as the market turned down, we didn't go down as much as the market. As the market has turned up, we haven't gone up as much as the market. And there's a little bit of product mix to do with that, right? We've said in the past, we're probably two-thirds that's leveraged towards the beginning of the start, one-third towards the end of the start. So that's one piece. Another of it is that we're probably not at the start. We know we're not at the start. We're anywhere from 30, sometimes 60 days later when our first product starts to hit the job site. So, a little bit of shifting around that in terms of timing of when our orders hit. Based on the trends we're seeing right now, we feel pretty good. We may have given up a little bit of share in our estimation, a couple of hundred million dollars worth. We talked a lot during the time line of the big supply chain disruptions about how advantaged we thought we were by having more product and being more effective at meeting customer needs where others struggle. And we're probably giving back a little bit of that as we anticipated, but that's kind of in the numbers you're seeing now. So, feeling pretty good about where we are versus the overall market. Like always, yes, sure. I mean, it will take some time to fully feather in, but it has started to move modestly and we certainly follow it on a consistent basis. The one point I'll make on that though is that one of the big movers has been OSB. I'm personally a little bit skeptical on the durability of that, only because we hear so much about incremental capacity coming online over the next year. We'll see. We'll see where it pans out, but that certainly is something to keep an eye on. So, I guess, I need to be a little careful how I answer that. On the first hand, we have seen incremental competition and margin erosion in core business, period, full stop. Now, it's not as much as we expected. It's not as much as we forecasted, hence the outperformance in that area. I would say that there's been a lot of strength in the volumes within the value-add, which gives us increasing confidence that we're meeting a need that our customers see value in it, that they're leveraging it to improve their cycle times, their job site efficiencies, their job site safety and that we're at a price point that's competitive that allows them to do what they need to do better. So, we're certainly pleased with all of that and have been seeing the competition. Now, the components of cost, the investments that we've made, but also the inflation we've seen, certainly, I think that has had a structural impact on the overall market, us included, but others as well, where you got to make a little more gross margin if you want to cover those incremental wage costs or truck costs or whatever it is. But then lastly, we've done a lot of work. We're much more efficient and that self-help has allowed us to earn more on the same equipment year-on-year because of our efficiency improvements, whether it be new automation that layers on the same equipment and facilities, sometimes it's a new equipment, but sometimes it's just better process. And all of those things are why that strength we've seen is sustainable. I think that helps to Dave's point, us be more competitive, right? We can still make good money where others are struggling. And if we can do it by being more reliable or on time and in-full being better that our quality is better, then we're always going to be the partner of choice for these builders who want to make sure their houses are high quality and on time. Thank you very much. Have a great day."

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Neese: Thank you, Shelly. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today we will review our results for the first quarter of 2023. The earnings press release, investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Rush: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call. Our start to 2023 has exceeded our expectations, as the work that we have put into transforming Builders FirstSource into the premier supplier of building product solutions is driving tangible results. We are confident that the resilience of our business and the exceptional positioning with our customers will become increasingly evident to the market as we progress through a dynamic year in 2023. Despite a challenging macro backdrop, we performed above forecast due to the strength of our product portfolio, execution on our strategic priorities and the tireless efforts of our team members.  We are managing through this complex environment by leveraging our best-in-class distribution footprint and end market exposure. We remain committed to enhancing our customer relationships by being the easiest in the industry to do business with, while driving improvements that will make home building more affordable and efficient. Our unrelenting emphasis on operational excellence positions us well to continue to execute our goals. We are driving share growth and mix improvement, while continuing to grow through accretive acquisition. Our recent transactions allow us to further expand our value added offerings and reach a more diverse customer base in attractive markets. While macroeconomic factors continue to dominate the headlines, we are closely monitoring local market activity by staying close to our customers and maintaining focus on our strategy. We are controlling what we can control and running the business for long-term value creation. Elevated mortgage rates and affordability challenges are headwinds. The feedback from some homebuilders has suggested that underlying demand has been resilient when we have seen mortgage rates dip. Though the results vary slightly by region, our April sales continued to offer encouraging signs that green shoes are starting to emerge across homebuilding.  On Slide 4, we show what we achieved in the first quarter. Among the highlights, our gross margin percentage increased 300 basis points to 35.3% driven by the strength of our multi-family value added product category. Our recent acquisitions which have diversified our footprint and enhanced our exposure to the multi-family sector have been a strong contributor for us this first quarter. Our EBITDA margin remained healthy in the first quarter as we executed well and drove improved productivity across the business. It is important to note that during the quarter with sales down 31.6%, our adjusted EBITDA margin was only off by 130 basis points compared to the prior year of quarter. This reinforces our belief that we can sustain a double digit EBITDA margin throughout this year as serving single-family starts declined by no more than 25%.  On Slide 5, while core organic sales declined relative to prior year, as single-family housing demand slowed, I would point out that multi-family and R&R/Other both grew. Multi-family was a tailwind this quarter and we expect this strength to continue for the remainder of 2023. Following recent acquisitions, multi-family margin more than doubled to 13% of our net sales in the first quarter versus 6% this time last year. We continue to focus on improving productivity and we are pleased to deliver $34 million in savings for the quarter as we leverage our BFS One Team Operating System. We are working hard to improve efficiencies through operational excellence focused on manufacturing and delivery improvements. This is evidenced by our 96% in full delivery metric.  We are dedicated to reducing our customer cycle times, with full deliveries and fewer trips to the job site, strengthening our customer relationships and helping to lower their total cost. We remain focused on the importance of controlling SG&A and other expenses. This includes efficient capacity utilization, ongoing optimization of our footprint, and balancing the need for variable cost reductions against future capacity needs.  In May 2020, we released our first corporate social responsibility report. We expect to release our 2023 CSR report later this month and look forward to sharing our progress on sustainability with our stakeholders. We are committed to addressing the risk of climate change, including taking actions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2022 and early 2023, we undertook and completed an extensive project to consolidate and report our energy use data. Through this work, we now monitor our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across our facilities and fleet and expect to report our 2022 greenhouse gas emissions later this month. We are leveraging this 2022 carbon emissions baseline to set appropriate emissions reduction goals. When we talk about our high-performing BFS culture, safety is our first priority. I am proud to say that we achieved a 22% reduction in our total recordable incident rate last year and have reduced it by another 30% so far this year. We continue to invest in our people by striving to make BFS the best place to work. We have improved benefits to a better track and retained high-performing talent and have trained over 99% of our team members today on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Turning to M&A on Slide 6, while the current M&A pipeline remains slower than prior years, we continue to target attractive opportunities with a disciplined approach. Thus far in 2023 these have been smaller deals, but given a highly fragmented nature of our industry, we still believe in our goal to invest an average of $500 million in M&A per year for the next several years.  As we mentioned on our call in February, we acquired Noltex Trust during the first quarter, a five-location trust manufacturer providing billing components to the single and multi-family markets throughout Texas. Since then we have acquired two more companies. Last month we acquired Builders Millwork Supply, a millwork distributor serving Anchorage, and this past Monday we acquired JB Millwork, which contributes important value added capacity in the Chattanooga area. We are excited to welcome these businesses and new team members to the BFS family.  Moving to Slide 7 and capital allocation. In the first quarter we deployed approximately $800 million of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A, and share repurchases, and we have cumulatively deployed $4.3 billion against our 2025, $7 billion to $10 billion goal. Looking forward, I am happy to announce we plan to host another Investor Day in December in Atlanta, where we would update our progress on our strategic initiatives, including the latest on our digital offerings. We will also provide a tour of our nearby robotic trust facility. We are planning to release more details in the coming months.  Now, let's turn to Slide 8 and provide an update on our digital strategy. We continue to play a pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry, growing our capabilities in 2022, and are working to drive enhancements and adoption throughout 2023. We are executing our digital product development plan and introducing our customers to the tools and their benefits through the myBLDR.com platform. We firmly believe our long-term commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies will deliver greater efficiency across home building, enhance our product and service offerings, and extend BFS's lead as a partner of choice in the market. During our last call we announced the launch of our myBLDR.com customer portal, which will ultimately provide our homebuilder customers with access to easy-to-use digital tools to virtually design and build their homes. One of those applications is Home Configure, which is already in use with a significant number of customers, while we continue to develop and pilot new capabilities that will be deployed throughout 2023. Home Configure is a three-dimensional virtual application that allows a user to configure a home while providing a more collaborative experience. These are the types of advancements putting us at the forefront of our industry as we continue to rapidly scale a whole suite of capabilities.  In Q1 we completed over 6,000 automated window and lumber takeoffs, an 80% increase over Q4 2022, and we had nearly 15,000 visitors who started 56,000 sessions in our Home Configure tool. This momentum gives us early confidence that our digital strategy remains on schedule, and we will continue to enhance the platform to drive adoption. Our digital tools will help us integrate more closely with our customers and ultimately result in incremental sell-through of our core building products as we gain share of wallet. We are on track to gain an incremental $1 billion in sales by 2026.  You have heard me say that our people are the building blocks of our organization. They inspire me every day to continue the evolution and growth of our people-first culture. Today I'm delighted to share a success story that represents the best of our sales team, Mitchell Ingram from Blairsville, Georgia.  Mitchell's journey began with us 17 years ago as a CDL driver, and from the very beginning he stood out for delivering exceptional customer service. For five years Mitchell was the driver that every customer wanted, as he flawlessly delivered materials to their job sites, earning their trust and loyalty. That natural ability for exceptional customer service led Mitchell to be then promoted to inside sales, where he continued to excel and quickly became the go-to salesperson for both our internal team and our customers.  Today, as a key member of our outside sales team, Mitchell has become the market's top salesperson and recently won a Leader of the Pack award, recognizing him as one of our top sales team members. On behalf of BFS, I extend my warmest congratulations to Mitchell for his outstanding contributions and achievements.  At BFS, we have many similar remarkable stories, further exemplifying our commitment to the team members that make us so successful. Their dedication and commitment are invaluable to our team's success, and we are fortunate to have them.  I will conclude by saying that our differentiated platform, experienced management team, and clear focus on delivering value-added solutions to our customers have positioned us well to win in the market and outperform. I'm very excited to lead this winning team. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail.\nPeter Jackson : Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered exceptional gross margins in the first quarter, despite a challenging macro backdrop. The advantages of value-added products and services are evident and key to our outperformance.  We generated strong free cash flow as we leveraged our best-in-class operating platform and extended our track record of effective cost containment and working capital management. Our robust financial position, industry-leading products and solutions, and reputation for providing excellent customer service allow us to successfully navigate macro volatility and position us for above market growth in the years to come.  I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our second quarter guidance and provide an update on our illustrative full year scenarios. Let's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slide 10. We delivered $3.9 billion in net sales. Core organic sales decreased by 26%, attributable to a 34% decline in single-family due to slowing demand and compared to a strong first quarter of 2022. Multi-family was a bright spot that reflects the benefit of our expansion strategy in this category, growing by nearly 70%. The growth was driven by multiple acquisitions and a strong rental market. R&R and Other grew by more than 3%, mainly attributable to increased sales focus and capacity versus prior year.  The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately five percentage points of growth to net sales and one additional selling day had a favorable impact of 1%. While core organic sales and value added products decreased by nearly 17% due to slowing single family starts, this is almost 10 points better than the overall core organic result and underscores the resilience of the value added product portfolio. Importantly, value added products represented 56% of our net sales in the quarter, reflecting our position as the supplier of choice to these valuable high margin products.  During the first quarter, gross profit was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 25.2% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 300 basis points to 35.3%, with more than half of the 300 basis points change coming from our multifamily value added products and services. SG&A decreased $64.4 million to $904.2 million, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $46 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 630 basis points to 23.3%, primarily attributable to decreased leverage to net sales. We remain focused on disciplined cost management and are taking appropriate actions in response to volume dynamics on a market-by-market basis. As we have stated in the past, approximately 70% of SG&A expense is variable with volumes. We are striking the right balance between calibrating operations based on changes in volume and protecting capacity for future growth.  Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $632 million, a decline of 37%, primarily driven by lower net sales, including a decline in core organic products attributable to a slowing housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was a robust 16.3%.  Adjusted net income was $410 million, down from an adjusted net income of $701 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.96, compared to $3.90 in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EPS was favorably offset by our repurchase of more than 7.5 million shares or $0.15 per share during the quarter.  Our first quarter results beat the guidance we provided in February, supported by gross margin strength, as value-added products over-delivered and productivity came in faster than forecast. As a result, we are increasingly confident that our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 28% plus versus our previous expectation of 27% plus. Now, let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our first quarter operating cash flow was approximately $654 million, up from $180 million in the prior year, mainly attributable to disciplined working capital management and improved product mix, as well as effective pricing and cost management. Capital expenditures were $100 million. All in, we delivered robust free cash flow of approximately $554 million. Free cash flow yield is 28.5%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 47.1% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.8x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end our total liquidity was $1.4 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in net borrowing, availability under the revolving credit facility and $144 million of cash-on-hand.  Moving to capital deployment, during the first quarter we repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares for $628 million at an average stock price of $83.17 a share. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares so far in the second quarter for $348 million at an average stock price of $91.90. In total, we have repurchased 39% of our outstanding shares since August of 2021. As we have completed our prior share repurchase authorization, the Board of Directors decided to approve a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and will continue to look for organic and inorganic growth opportunities and to repurchase shares at an attractive value while maintaining our fortress balance sheet.  Now, I would like to discuss our guide on Slide 13. Given the ongoing challenging conditions in the housing market, we are continuing to provide quarterly guidance. We will reassess our full year guidance for actual and base business as the year progresses. For the second quarter we expect net sales to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 13.1% to 13.7%.  Our adjusted EBITDA guide for the second quarter assumes gross margins in the 32% to 34% range. Our second quarter guidance includes the following full year assumptions, which are also outlined in the earnings release and on Slide 14. We expect total capital expenditures in the range of $325 million to $375 million. This includes continued investments in scaling our value-added products. We expect interest expense in the range of $150 million to $170 million, an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%, depreciation and amortization expenses in the range of $525 million to $575 million, no change in the number of selling days versus the prior year. And finally, we expect to deliver between $90 million and $110 million in annual productivity savings.  We recognize that it is important to think about potential outcomes for the full year. So on Slide 15, we have updated our scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions.  As you can see, our strong Q1 performance and visibility into Q2 have meaningfully improved our expectations for each of the full year performance scenarios. Single-family starts are down 15% for the year, we now believe we could generate roughly $2.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which is up $500 million from our fourth quarter scenario analysis. This increased EBITDA expectation reflects stronger gross margins and productivity savings than we previously expected.  As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are exceptionally well positioned to drive our strategic goals forward. We believe that we can sustain a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year, and we continue to see the benefits of our transformed business. I believe that our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 28% or higher.  I'm confident in our best-in-class operating platform, will continue to set us up to generate substantial free cash flow, which provides further financial flexibility on top of our healthy balance sheet. We will also continue to diligently deploy capital and work to manage, to maximize long-term shareholder value.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks. \nDave Rush : Thanks Peter. Let me close by saying that we feel really good about our strategy and our execution so far in 2023. Our investments in value-added products, productivity initiatives, and digital solutions are all delivering on our goal to improve our customers experience in partnership with BFS, while driving growth over the long term.  While 2023 still appears to be a challenging year for our industry, I'm confident that we can create value for our shareholders through executing our strategy, our focus on value-added products and services, and our disciplined deployment of capital towards growth opportunities.  Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning everyone. Congrats on the results. Thank you for taking the questions. So jumping right to the gross margin question, you raised the long-term guide to \u2013 the normalized guide to 28% plus. I think I heard you say value adds a little better and productivity coming in faster. My question is, you talk about the benefits of kind of a transformed business. I mean, is this a view to some of these shorter term trends that you're talking about? You got a little more visibility to the trough as a result or just what are some of the bigger underlying pieces, market share, etc. that give you confidence to say that now is the time to raise that gross margin target. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. Yeah, no, it's a great question. We've been talking, about gross margins for quite a while now, ever since the merger and trying to get a sense of where normal is. We felt really good based on where the business was at that merger date. That 27% or better was something we felt good about on sort of a long-term normalized basis, taking out all the noise around supply chain and that type of thing.  But we were continuing to look at it, right? We've been looking at it, managing the business, but in the meantime, we've been working. So, we've worked to improve our value add as a percentage of the overall business, right. The acquisitions we've made, improving mix, it's grown faster, and it\u2019s been more resilient. So the biggest component being just the increased mix of value add on an ongoing basis, we think that's meaningful and important to our average gross margins over time.  In addition, we've done a really good job internally of managing productivity, even in a volume down market overall, certainly giving us a lot of confidence that the investments we've made in value add productivity and automation have yielded the benefits we were expecting. So those two factors are the most powerful. And the last one I think is, as we've seen a market as down as it was in Q1, and I think we can all admit, this was a challenging year-over-year compare, we still performed very, very well and that gives us the confidence that we needed to start moving that normalized margin up to 28% plus, because we see that as being really proof positive of the value of what that product does for our customers and for us.\nDave Rush: Yeah, I'd just add Matt, that customers see those products as less price sensitive because they are solving problems for them, they are addressing labor concerns for them, and they are reducing cycle times for them, and they can make up some of those costs through the reduction of those cycle times. So that's why we focus on it, from being easiest to do business with perspective and driving value for our customers. \nMatthew Bouley: Got you. Okay, great call there. Thank you for that. And then second one, kind of jumping into the near term. The Q2 EBITDA guide, I mean you're guiding in dollars and margin I guess to be lower than that of Q1, which is obviously unusual historically. And I know you're on this path to normalizing gross margin and that looks to be part of that. But any other detail on what are some of the underlying assumptions around Q2, and why you would have such a kind of unusual seasonality there? Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Sure. Yeah, and I'll let Dave talk to the overall market. What I would say is this is consistent with what we have been communicating. This still assumes that we're going to continue to see an increased competitive environment, a challenging volume environment in Q2, and normalization that continues to flow through in margins and sales. So while we're absolutely confident in the business, I don't want anybody to think that there still aren't some difficult comps coming, at least for the next quarter or two and that's really what you're seeing there in the numbers. \nDave Rush: So, what we're hearing from customers is the word stability. You're not really hearing robust. You're hearing more things are stable and that's kind of what we're using as the backdrop of our valuations for our forecast as well. There's increased optimism when mortgage rates stay consistent, and the underlying demand supports a fairly resilient demand when mortgage rates stay consistent. But it's still a volatile overall environment, and we're working with that as a backdrop. And so we're feeling pretty good, but it's all on a relative basis.\nMatthew Bouley: All right, well thank you Dave, thanks Peter. Good luck guys.\nA - Peter Jackson: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to kind of pick up on a couple of those points or questions that Matt had. When we think about the margins and gross margins specifically, you know I think clear enough in terms of your description of normal. You know in the first half of this year you're basically guiding to a mid-30s, low to mid-30s gross margin and even if I were to adjust for a mix, which seems more recurring than non-recurring, you'd still reach that level. It looks like the full year, like the middle scenario if you're at 13% to 14% EBITDA margins, also seems to imply maybe like a low 30s gross margin.  So I guess (a) is that the full year expectation embedded? (b) Could \u2013 you know I know there's still some potential timing impact in the first half. Maybe you could just articulate what some of those are in terms of things that have been good guides in your favor. And then if I \u2013 sorry for the multi-part question, but (c) would be, I think you said, \u2018hey, we'll tell you more about base business as the year progresses.\u2019 But if I take that delta between what you expect for gross margin this year and that 28, should we assume that it's kind of like a few hundred million dollars right now that could be still a little bit temporary in your opinion?\nPeter Jackson: So there's one question in 27 parts. I'll do my best and you can tell me if I hit all the points. The first one is around margins. I mean the difference between our guide, which is 28% plus on a normalized basis and what we've talked about in our guide for Q2 for example in the 30, you know mid to low 30s, low to mid 30s, yes you're right, there is a disconnect there.  We didn't provide explicit guidance around full year. I mean obviously those scenarios have some numbers embedded, but I think the message we're trying to send is we're in a very volatile environment still. We're seeing pretty significant step downs in volumes and while we have a much better sense of how the market is going to react, we haven't fully digested it.  So what we're saying in our numbers for this year is that we started exceptionally strong. That'll of course take our full year average in gross margins up above what we would consider to be normalized margins on an ongoing basis. But as we learn more and as we get better confidence, we'll continue to update that normalized number with our best understanding.  You know in terms of what has happened in the near term, I think one of the things that we've been pleasantly surprised by in recent periods has been the strength of gross margins, the resiliency of gross margins. While a big piece of that is mix, I think it's important to point out that our gross margin performance this quarter was really primarily driven by that multi-family investment that we've made.  That business as you know has longer lead times on their quote to delivery, which means there's a bit more exposure to commodities and in this environment that's a favorable thing. So there's some transitory benefit in there. We're certainly pleased with that business's performance overall and really happy to have it as part of the business. But those are the types of things we're accounting for when we're giving these normalized gross margin numbers. Did I hit all your points Mike?\nMike Dahl: Yeah, yeah, pretty much.\nDave Rush: I would just add Mike that, yeah the multi-family tailwind will wane as we go farther into the year for sure. And you know we also anticipate the products that anyone can provide will be increasingly competitive, because supply chain issues have waned as well. But the stuff we're good at, the value-added stuff we're good at is where it's a little stickier. So it's a combination of all of those.\nMike Dahl: Okay, yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you both. And then in terms of a follow-up, just on capital allocation. I mean look, even if some of this is a little temporary in the first half, the underlying EBITDA number, it starts coming through consistent with your middle scenario is incredibly strong. The free cash flow conversions have been great. You've obviously been pretty aggressive buying back the stock, you know a billion dollars effectively in just the last four months.  The new authorization is for $1 billion. It seems like you'll throw off considerably more free cash this year. So just thoughts on kind of why not a bigger, why not a bigger authorization just to have it out there, maybe some puts and takes and any more explicit direction you could provide on what type of free cash conversion you'd expect for the full year?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah, and I think probably the first point is that, our thinking around that free cash flow conversion is probably north of $1.5 billion now, because of that call-off we said north of $1 billion in the past, so that's a significant increase in terms of what we're seeing. As you know Mike, some of that is really attributable to the slowdown in the business and the spinning off of some of the value on our working capital balance sheet. The reality is, we are performing quite well and we will continue to deploy capital in the strategy that we've outlined in the past. The board has been very supportive, whenever we need authorization, because we think we have cash to put to work, they'll be there for us and they're absolutely hand-in-glove with us on this strategy, so $1 billion seems fine for now, but we'll revisit it if it makes sense.  I mean the only thing I'll point out is, right, we're done with sort of the windfall benefit of the very, very high commodities, so some of the volumes of share buyback that we've seen over the past couple of years because of those commodities are past that. \nMike Dahl: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: Hey! Good morning, everyone and yeah, congrats on the quarter. \nDave Rush : Trey, thank you.\nTrey Grooms: Sure thing. Peter, I think you said you expect to see increased competitive behavior or an increased competitive environment. How does the competitive behavior look in some of your maybe tougher demand markets versus some of the better markets and are you starting to see that behavior, the competitiveness kind of creep up more in these more difficult markets and is it more or less competitive maybe than what you've seen in prior slowdowns?\nDave Rush : Hey Trey, this is Dave. I think it's a market-by-market evaluation Trey. I mean, again, it's still similar to what we've said previously. If you go from west to east, it's a little tougher out west than it is in the east, and where demand is a little tougher, we're seeing definitely more competition, again, around the products that anyone can do. Where we're still doing really well is with the value-added products and the stickiness with those customers around those products and being able to get value for those, because they're more valuable to the customer. Again, it's something that creates efficiencies for them, solves problems for them, they are willing to pay more in those scenarios, because they see the value. But it's generally more west to east as far as competition is going right now around areas where anybody can provide the product and where the supply chain has started to normalize.\nTrey Grooms: Okay, got it. Thank you for that, and then I guess as a follow-up, you call out the operational excellence and cost management initiatives that are helping to drive these gains in efficiency and productivity. Longer term, I see kind of it's obvious what it's doing for the near term and in a downside kind of an environment, but longer term, how do you think about maybe the sustainability of some of these actions and these things driving better margins as end markets improve? \nDave Rush : Well, I think that the exciting thing for me Trey is, where we have the most opportunity is where we're already pretty good, and that's in the manufacturing efficiencies and driving technology that create labor efficiencies in the manufacturing process. You've heard us use that we have increased 22% of board foot per labor hour. That's continuing to improve, and as we continue to invest in that segment of the business, there's still a pretty long runway there.  As far as the distribution side of the business, the exciting thing there is, as we continue to develop best practices and then we leverage it across 570 locations, that generally also is a meaningful number, and we still think there's opportunity along those lines as well, and all of that supports our pledge that we're going to be the easiest to do business with, and it also is something that we can illustrate to our customers, where we bring value to the party beyond just delivering product. \nA - Peter Jackson: The other thing I would add is, you know when we talk about the productivity numbers, these are numbers that we've done the work around to analyze that this is permanent change. We're not trying to take credit on productivity for something that sort of comes and goes as a freebie in the year that we're not going to be able to repeat. These are changes to the business. These are operating changes. These are contractual changes that we feel good about in terms of having changed the business for the better over time and we do think it's cumulative and sticky.\nTrey Grooms: Perfect. Thanks for that guys. I'll pass it on.\nA - Peter Jackson: Thank you. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies.\nCollin Verron : Good morning. Great quarter. My first question here is just, you came in ahead of that 1Q guide which you gave at the end of February. Can you just talk about what came in better than you were expecting? Was it underlying demand? Was it a specific product category? Were you just able to hold on to commodity prices better? And since you gave that guide so late in the quarter, can you just give us a sense of how the year-over-year sales declines exited the quarter versus earlier in the quarter?\nA - Peter Jackson: Sure. Yeah, no. That's certainly internally that was a bit of a black eye for the organization in terms of the accuracy of our forecast. We knew we were doing well and we felt like the momentum was good, but what we thought was coming was worse than what we actually experienced. That competitive dynamic did not ramp up as quick as we expected. The dynamics didn\u2019t \u2013 you know a lot of it was obviously that value-add, that multifamily we've talked about. But even the commodity numbers on some of the longer-term contracts and just some of the way that we floated through was better than we anticipated.  So certainly that operating team has done a fantastic job of managing through all the local market dynamics to ensure that they are moving through product and getting a good compensation for what we've been seeing, but we were certainly surprised at how strong all that was. You know it was an interesting quarter in terms of what we saw in the numbers. You won't hear us whine about the weather, but certainly weather on the West Coast, weather in Texas was disruptive in certain periods. That's been a push and a take \u2013 that give and a take. That's definitely continuing to work through, so while we feel good about it that's a piece.  We also saw the impacts of those interest rate changes, whether they\u2019d be surprises up or down were certainly influential on what our builders were reacting to, right, what our customers were reacting to in the market, but overall I think we feel pretty good as Dave was saying. \nDave Rush : But I would just add, you know early in the year with the volatility of expectation that was out pretty much with anybody that you taught, it was tough to put a stake in the ground and say \u2018we're great and we know we're going to be okay.\u2019 Our guys did a fantastic job of preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. So we prepared for the downside scenario with our cost management, and then as we got clearer sights of how the market or the quarter was going to play out, we managed against that baseline.  And as you heard, even from our builder customers, we just reflected the same sentiment they did at that point in time. And as you're hearing them now, they are also saying it was better than they expected. So it's kind of a combination of all of that. \nCollin Verron : That's helpful color. And then just on the multifamily business here, obviously very strong in the quarter. Can you just talk about the size of the backlog that you guys have remaining in that business and any guardrails on how to think about the business through the rest of the year here?\nPeter Jackson: Well, it's certainly a nice part about that business is we do have a bit more visibility to the backlog. Right now it is substantial, because that part of the market has been strong and in somewhat surprising fashion has maintained its strength. I think there's absolutely a great profitability story in that world right now.  But as Dave mentioned, that will continue to normalize over time as the coal prices and the market prices of commodities tighten. But yeah, that's absolutely part of both, what allowed us to do the M&A in that sector of the market, but what we're enjoying in terms of the results so far this year and through all of 2023.\nDave Rush: The only thing I'd add is we've got a really substantial backlog that gets us through 2023 and beyond. But that backlog is declining. In other words, we're completing jobs at a faster pace than we're filling the pipeline back up, because that sector in general is facing the same capital cost issues that the single-family sector is facing. And there's just kind of a pause or a hesitancy in that group to try to figure out what the value proposition going forward needs to look like.  We still believe, again long-term, housing demand wins, including in multifamily. But as there's a little bit of a recalibration of that capital cost, we are seeing jobs finished at a greater rate than jobs being entered into the pipeline out 12 months and beyond.\nCollin Verron : Great, and good luck in the second quarter.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. \nStanley Elliott: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for the question and a nice start to the year. Hey Dave, piggybacking on the commentary on the multi-family side, when we think about the value added part of the business, does it break down pretty consistently between your single-family, multi-family buckets? And then how quickly is it or how difficult is it rather, for you all to switch kind of focus in between the individual markets if we do see kind of a multi-family decline in \u201824 and beyond? \nDave Rush: Stanley, can you repeat the first question? You broke up. \nStanley Elliott: Yeah, sorry about that. So in terms of kind of the multifamily or the value-add piece as a whole, is there a way to differentiate or delineate between how much of your value add is going into multi-family now versus single-family? Maybe it's just consistent with the overall portfolio, but I was looking for maybe a little direction there. And then also in terms of the ability to pivot your products necessarily between multi-family or single-family, more on some of the manufactured side, depending upon what's going to happen with those end markets. \nDave Rush: Yeah, thanks for that question. Within the multi-family segment for us, it's primarily value-add. We don't do a lot of non-value add with our multi-family customers and Truss is the overwhelming majority of the value-add. So it will always have a higher percent of multi-family sales as being value-add.  Now in the context of the overall business, it's still a fairly \u2013 it's 13% of our total business. So even in that context, it doesn't move the needle very much either way versus the single-family.  Now, what I will tell you, is our guys have done a great job where we have multi-family plants at capacity moving business to single-family plants that are under capacity. And that's the value of our platform and the ability to have, to manage the effectiveness of where we can build those Trusses in the most efficient way by having the availability of those single-family plants.  So there is a coordinated effort to build those Trusses where we can get the most efficient cost and it has to be within the radius of the job that we're trying to supply. But there's a lot of coordination that goes on there and a significant integration effort to make that happen. \nStanley Elliott: Perfect. Actually, that's great color. Thank you and then in terms of kind of the outlook, I mean, the free cash flow continues to be quite good. Even with M&A, you guys are going to be below half a turn of leverage. Peter, how are you guys thinking about managing the capital structure? I mean, you mentioned repurchases, but so what is your comfort level in terms of leverage right now, given that we are in kind of a still somewhat uncertain market?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah, I think as a general guideline we still like one to two times based business as a guideline that is helpful in terms of thinking about how to minimize our risk, but still take on an appropriate amount of it. It's a metric that if you think about base business in the last year, we'd say we have room, but we're certainly in the range, rather than if you just look at our trailing 12 actuals, it looks like we're a little bit under leveraged in that regard.  So as this business normalizes, as we get a better visibility into 2023 full year, we'll go ahead and update that base business, give you an updated thought process around the leverage ratio. But at this point, we feel pretty good about our borrowing, both the cost and the tenure and we'll continue to watch it.\nStanley Elliott: Great, guys. Thanks for the question. Best of luck!\nPeter Jackson: Thanks Stanley. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. \nJay McCanless: Hey! Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So just, I know that lumber, the actual commodity cost is becoming less relevant for your business, but it's been surprising how subdued the lumber market and lumber prices have been this year, especially in light of some of the curtailments that we're starting to hear about. I guess, maybe what are you hearing from your suppliers there, and how are you feeling about the direction of the lumber prices over the next two to three months? \nPeter Jackson: Yeah, that's a tough question to answer. I think we continue to manage it on a flow-through basis, ensuring that we get the right margins for us. It's been a little bit of back and forth, I hear you. There have been some indications that taking capacity out might be helpful to put a floor under it. There's been some other murmuring, particularly on the OSB side about adding capacity. I think it's kind of range-bound right now, but it\u2019s tough to say. It's been such a surprising commodity over the last few years. I certainly don't feel comfortable predicting, but we're ready.\nJay McCanless: Okay. And the other question, I think and Dave you may have already addressed this, but just wondering with some of the financial pressures that supposedly are coming from banks tightening credit, etc. Have you seen your competition on the distribution side getting more aggressive on price or is this lift in sentiment from the builders in March and April been able to diffuse some of that or most of that? \nDave Rush: I think what you're saying is or asking about is the bank implications on demand, and as a result, what is that doing with our supply chain partners? I would tell you there are products that there is a little of additional capacity versus demand, but in general, our supply chain partners at this point in time have worked through where they had excess capacity in the first quarter and kept things at a normalized environment.  So they are still experiencing inflationary pressures in their business as well, specifically around labor, and they've been a little reluctant to get too aggressive, unless it was to balance the capacity versus on-hand situation, which pretty much worked itself out in the first quarter. So I think we're in that. You know the word of the day for the industry is stabilization. I think we're all in kind of a stable market and trying to be nimble and be able to respond either on the upside or the downside as necessary, and I think that's kind of where we are today.\nJay McCanless: Okay. That sounds great. Thanks for taking my questions. \nPeter Jackson: Thanks Jay.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsey : Hi! Good morning. Maybe just to clarify on the first quarter, better than expected start to the year, was that in all segments or did one segment drive that over another? And maybe you can dovetail into the green shoots that you saw in April, maybe elaborate how that is connected to the better start. \nPeter Jackson: Well, fair question. I would say overall we saw more resiliency in the market than we had forecasted. I think that's fair to say across the board. We saw the most resiliency in the geographically in the East, I would say product-wise in value-add. And in terms of the timing on that, I don't think there's anything strong indicating there is a time horizon that caused the results to be different, meaning each market is digesting what their demand looks like, each market is resetting and placing orders. But overall, I think it's been more orderly and more disciplined in terms of reacting to the step down in sales than we'd originally forecast.\nDave Rush: As far as the green shoots comment, I think what we're seeing from our customers is they are cautiously optimistic. Again, that things will be stable, and there are areas where things are showing the ability for demand to be resilient when mortgage rates are at a level where buyers enter into the market again.  Areas of the country that we've seen where that's a little better are where there's actual pockets of strength with real job growth versus what was somewhat of a boom during COVID that's kind of now receded. So again, mainly moving west to east is where we see it improving. And west is coming, starting to show signs of at least of leveling out. \nSteven Ramsey : Okay, that's helpful. And then thinking longer term, the secular penetration of value added products in multi-family and single-family, how do you see that shaping up over the long term? You said multi-family is mostly value added products. So, is there less of a penetration opportunity there or adding more value added products into that portfolio for those customers? \nPeter Jackson: Yeah, I mean overall we're very excited about what value-add means in the long term. We've certainly moved the needle quite a bit in terms of our max being a 56% value-add this quarter, but we're not done. There's more opportunity geographically. There are more opportunities to have the full portfolio of products that we have in our offering in markets where it's not there yet. And I think where we ultimately expect to get to is if you look at the digital world, the ability to do more and more of that value-added [inaudible].  We're looking for ways to grow our ability to serve our customers, make them more efficient, help their total cost of build go down. So we're certainly excited about it. We think there's a lot of opportunity there still. You know, there's not a lot of great numbers in terms of share, so it's a little harder to talk about it that way, but we're certainly believers that there's much more to come. \nDave Rush: And the only other thing I'd add specifically around Truss is the premise around adding multifamily Truss was in market diversification from single-family. And that only works when you have the coordination between the single-family plants and the multi-family plants to be able to share work. And what we're doing really well is figuring that out and integrating that, and it accomplishes our objective to make sure when multi-family's hot, we're able to hit there, when single-family's hot we're able to hit there.\nSteven Ramsey : Excellent! Thank you for the color.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank. \nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Yeah, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the impressive results. \nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Joe. \nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Looking at your windows, doors and millwork performance in the quarter, essentially flat year-over-year, could you just maybe unpack that a little more with respect to what drove that? Are we seeing perhaps stronger pricing in doors? Is this mainly the multi-family performance or are we also perhaps seeing a manifestation of the single family completions still positive on a quarterly basis here? \nPeter Jackson: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of a couple of those things. The completion certainly remains strong on those back of the building process products, windows, doors and millwork, a good example. I think there was quite a bit of disruption in that part of the market as well, which slowed the ability to put product on the ground when needed. So that's another big component, but we've also invested. So there's increased ability to serve as well.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Great. And sitting here this time next year, if we're looking at this bridge on page 10, is it likely that we see now the commodity deflation bucket fairly de minimis on a year-over-year basis? And relatedly, that same bucket in the second quarter coming up here, your expectation for that, I assume is a significant increase in the headwind versus 1Q. So maybe just some context around how that shapes up next quarter and this time next year? Thanks. \nPeter Jackson: Yeah, no, you're right. We should have digested the bulk of all this commodity noise, the commodity volatility by next year. Q2 would be the biggest comp in terms of peak pricing hit in Q2 of last year. So it may drain a little bit into Q3, but Q2 is the biggest impact on a year-over-year basis, that's right.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Could it be as much as $2 billion to $2.5 billion of a headwind on sales or is that too aggressive?\nPeter Jackson: We can get back to you on that one. I don't actually have that narrow of a guide off the top of my head. \nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Okay, no worries. Thanks a lot guys.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Yeah, thank you. Good morning everyone. When you talk about productivity savings here, I'm just definitionally wondering, is that mostly or entirely in SG&A? And for example, the $34 million in productivity this quarter, is that separate from your higher gross margin outlook or is there some overlap between the two?\nDave Rush: Yeah. The productivity savings actually is also a component of margin where it relates to manufacturing, where we've gained manufacturing efficiencies. It actually is a positive contributor to our margin as well, so it's both. When we get it in the SG&A categories and the COGS categories through manufacturing efficiencies.\nDavid Manthey: And I assume that varies from quarter to quarter, so there's no base rule we should be thinking about? \nPeter Jackson: That is correct.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. \nPeter Jackson: Thanks David.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten : Hey! Good morning, guys. Can you walk us through what you're seeing on pricing for the non-commodity part of the business?\nPeter Jackson: Yeah. I mean, I think commodity pricing has been the headline that we've all talked about, but there's certainly been a lot of work done on the pricing in the non-commodity side. It's an area that I think really lends itself to the process and the discipline that we've implemented over the last five years or so. So certainly, a nice offset to the volume headwinds from the pricing side. Obviously not all of it, but certainly strong healthy pricing in that space. A chunk of it is absolutely attributable to the multi-family mix change and the profitability of that business.\nAdam Baumgarten : Got it. Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora : Thanks for taking my question. Peter, can you just clarify how you think about free cash flow for 2023? I thought I heard $1.5 billion earlier in the comments. \nPeter Jackson: Yeah. You know, free cash flow continues to be a bright spot for us. We actually generated a substantial amount in Q1, and you know that's a bit unusual for us. Some of that has to do with the resizing of the business on a year-over-year comparison basis. But we're still performing well, still quite profitable. So we're comfortable saying that we expect cash flows to be kind of north of that $1.5 billion range for 2023, based on sort of the most likely or middle over the path scenario that we provided.\nKetan Mamtora : You said north of $1.5 billion Peter, just to clarify?\nPeter Jackson: That's correct.\nKetan Mamtora : Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Rush",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call. Our start to 2023 has exceeded our expectations, as the work that we have put into transforming Builders FirstSource into the premier supplier of building product solutions is driving tangible results. We are confident that the resilience of our business and the exceptional positioning with our customers will become increasingly evident to the market as we progress through a dynamic year in 2023. Despite a challenging macro backdrop, we performed above forecast due to the strength of our product portfolio, execution on our strategic priorities and the tireless efforts of our team members.  We are managing through this complex environment by leveraging our best-in-class distribution footprint and end market exposure. We remain committed to enhancing our customer relationships by being the easiest in the industry to do business with, while driving improvements that will make home building more affordable and efficient. Our unrelenting emphasis on operational excellence positions us well to continue to execute our goals. We are driving share growth and mix improvement, while continuing to grow through accretive acquisition. Our recent transactions allow us to further expand our value added offerings and reach a more diverse customer base in attractive markets. While macroeconomic factors continue to dominate the headlines, we are closely monitoring local market activity by staying close to our customers and maintaining focus on our strategy. We are controlling what we can control and running the business for long-term value creation. Elevated mortgage rates and affordability challenges are headwinds. The feedback from some homebuilders has suggested that underlying demand has been resilient when we have seen mortgage rates dip. Though the results vary slightly by region, our April sales continued to offer encouraging signs that green shoes are starting to emerge across homebuilding.  On Slide 4, we show what we achieved in the first quarter. Among the highlights, our gross margin percentage increased 300 basis points to 35.3% driven by the strength of our multi-family value added product category. Our recent acquisitions which have diversified our footprint and enhanced our exposure to the multi-family sector have been a strong contributor for us this first quarter. Our EBITDA margin remained healthy in the first quarter as we executed well and drove improved productivity across the business. It is important to note that during the quarter with sales down 31.6%, our adjusted EBITDA margin was only off by 130 basis points compared to the prior year of quarter. This reinforces our belief that we can sustain a double digit EBITDA margin throughout this year as serving single-family starts declined by no more than 25%.  On Slide 5, while core organic sales declined relative to prior year, as single-family housing demand slowed, I would point out that multi-family and R&R/Other both grew. Multi-family was a tailwind this quarter and we expect this strength to continue for the remainder of 2023. Following recent acquisitions, multi-family margin more than doubled to 13% of our net sales in the first quarter versus 6% this time last year. We continue to focus on improving productivity and we are pleased to deliver $34 million in savings for the quarter as we leverage our BFS One Team Operating System. We are working hard to improve efficiencies through operational excellence focused on manufacturing and delivery improvements. This is evidenced by our 96% in full delivery metric.  We are dedicated to reducing our customer cycle times, with full deliveries and fewer trips to the job site, strengthening our customer relationships and helping to lower their total cost. We remain focused on the importance of controlling SG&A and other expenses. This includes efficient capacity utilization, ongoing optimization of our footprint, and balancing the need for variable cost reductions against future capacity needs.  In May 2020, we released our first corporate social responsibility report. We expect to release our 2023 CSR report later this month and look forward to sharing our progress on sustainability with our stakeholders. We are committed to addressing the risk of climate change, including taking actions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2022 and early 2023, we undertook and completed an extensive project to consolidate and report our energy use data. Through this work, we now monitor our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across our facilities and fleet and expect to report our 2022 greenhouse gas emissions later this month. We are leveraging this 2022 carbon emissions baseline to set appropriate emissions reduction goals. When we talk about our high-performing BFS culture, safety is our first priority. I am proud to say that we achieved a 22% reduction in our total recordable incident rate last year and have reduced it by another 30% so far this year. We continue to invest in our people by striving to make BFS the best place to work. We have improved benefits to a better track and retained high-performing talent and have trained over 99% of our team members today on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Turning to M&A on Slide 6, while the current M&A pipeline remains slower than prior years, we continue to target attractive opportunities with a disciplined approach. Thus far in 2023 these have been smaller deals, but given a highly fragmented nature of our industry, we still believe in our goal to invest an average of $500 million in M&A per year for the next several years.  As we mentioned on our call in February, we acquired Noltex Trust during the first quarter, a five-location trust manufacturer providing billing components to the single and multi-family markets throughout Texas. Since then we have acquired two more companies. Last month we acquired Builders Millwork Supply, a millwork distributor serving Anchorage, and this past Monday we acquired JB Millwork, which contributes important value added capacity in the Chattanooga area. We are excited to welcome these businesses and new team members to the BFS family.  Moving to Slide 7 and capital allocation. In the first quarter we deployed approximately $800 million of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A, and share repurchases, and we have cumulatively deployed $4.3 billion against our 2025, $7 billion to $10 billion goal. Looking forward, I am happy to announce we plan to host another Investor Day in December in Atlanta, where we would update our progress on our strategic initiatives, including the latest on our digital offerings. We will also provide a tour of our nearby robotic trust facility. We are planning to release more details in the coming months.  Now, let's turn to Slide 8 and provide an update on our digital strategy. We continue to play a pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry, growing our capabilities in 2022, and are working to drive enhancements and adoption throughout 2023. We are executing our digital product development plan and introducing our customers to the tools and their benefits through the myBLDR.com platform. We firmly believe our long-term commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies will deliver greater efficiency across home building, enhance our product and service offerings, and extend BFS's lead as a partner of choice in the market. During our last call we announced the launch of our myBLDR.com customer portal, which will ultimately provide our homebuilder customers with access to easy-to-use digital tools to virtually design and build their homes. One of those applications is Home Configure, which is already in use with a significant number of customers, while we continue to develop and pilot new capabilities that will be deployed throughout 2023. Home Configure is a three-dimensional virtual application that allows a user to configure a home while providing a more collaborative experience. These are the types of advancements putting us at the forefront of our industry as we continue to rapidly scale a whole suite of capabilities.  In Q1 we completed over 6,000 automated window and lumber takeoffs, an 80% increase over Q4 2022, and we had nearly 15,000 visitors who started 56,000 sessions in our Home Configure tool. This momentum gives us early confidence that our digital strategy remains on schedule, and we will continue to enhance the platform to drive adoption. Our digital tools will help us integrate more closely with our customers and ultimately result in incremental sell-through of our core building products as we gain share of wallet. We are on track to gain an incremental $1 billion in sales by 2026.  You have heard me say that our people are the building blocks of our organization. They inspire me every day to continue the evolution and growth of our people-first culture. Today I'm delighted to share a success story that represents the best of our sales team, Mitchell Ingram from Blairsville, Georgia.  Mitchell's journey began with us 17 years ago as a CDL driver, and from the very beginning he stood out for delivering exceptional customer service. For five years Mitchell was the driver that every customer wanted, as he flawlessly delivered materials to their job sites, earning their trust and loyalty. That natural ability for exceptional customer service led Mitchell to be then promoted to inside sales, where he continued to excel and quickly became the go-to salesperson for both our internal team and our customers.  Today, as a key member of our outside sales team, Mitchell has become the market's top salesperson and recently won a Leader of the Pack award, recognizing him as one of our top sales team members. On behalf of BFS, I extend my warmest congratulations to Mitchell for his outstanding contributions and achievements.  At BFS, we have many similar remarkable stories, further exemplifying our commitment to the team members that make us so successful. Their dedication and commitment are invaluable to our team's success, and we are fortunate to have them.  I will conclude by saying that our differentiated platform, experienced management team, and clear focus on delivering value-added solutions to our customers have positioned us well to win in the market and outperform. I'm very excited to lead this winning team. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Thanks Peter. Let me close by saying that we feel really good about our strategy and our execution so far in 2023. Our investments in value-added products, productivity initiatives, and digital solutions are all delivering on our goal to improve our customers experience in partnership with BFS, while driving growth over the long term.  While 2023 still appears to be a challenging year for our industry, I'm confident that we can create value for our shareholders through executing our strategy, our focus on value-added products and services, and our disciplined deployment of capital towards growth opportunities.  Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. Yeah, I'd just add Matt, that customers see those products as less price sensitive because they are solving problems for them, they are addressing labor concerns for them, and they are reducing cycle times for them, and they can make up some of those costs through the reduction of those cycle times. So that's why we focus on it, from being easiest to do business with perspective and driving value for our customers. So, what we're hearing from customers is the word stability. You're not really hearing robust. You're hearing more things are stable and that's kind of what we're using as the backdrop of our valuations for our forecast as well. There's increased optimism when mortgage rates stay consistent, and the underlying demand supports a fairly resilient demand when mortgage rates stay consistent. But it's still a volatile overall environment, and we're working with that as a backdrop. And so we're feeling pretty good, but it's all on a relative basis. I would just add Mike that, yeah the multi-family tailwind will wane as we go farther into the year for sure. And you know we also anticipate the products that anyone can provide will be increasingly competitive, because supply chain issues have waned as well. But the stuff we're good at, the value-added stuff we're good at is where it's a little stickier. So it's a combination of all of those. Trey, thank you. Hey Trey, this is Dave. I think it's a market-by-market evaluation Trey. I mean, again, it's still similar to what we've said previously. If you go from west to east, it's a little tougher out west than it is in the east, and where demand is a little tougher, we're seeing definitely more competition, again, around the products that anyone can do. Where we're still doing really well is with the value-added products and the stickiness with those customers around those products and being able to get value for those, because they're more valuable to the customer. Again, it's something that creates efficiencies for them, solves problems for them, they are willing to pay more in those scenarios, because they see the value. But it's generally more west to east as far as competition is going right now around areas where anybody can provide the product and where the supply chain has started to normalize. Well, I think that the exciting thing for me Trey is, where we have the most opportunity is where we're already pretty good, and that's in the manufacturing efficiencies and driving technology that create labor efficiencies in the manufacturing process. You've heard us use that we have increased 22% of board foot per labor hour. That's continuing to improve, and as we continue to invest in that segment of the business, there's still a pretty long runway there.  As far as the distribution side of the business, the exciting thing there is, as we continue to develop best practices and then we leverage it across 570 locations, that generally also is a meaningful number, and we still think there's opportunity along those lines as well, and all of that supports our pledge that we're going to be the easiest to do business with, and it also is something that we can illustrate to our customers, where we bring value to the party beyond just delivering product. But I would just add, you know early in the year with the volatility of expectation that was out pretty much with anybody that you taught, it was tough to put a stake in the ground and say \u2018we're great and we know we're going to be okay.' Our guys did a fantastic job of preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. So we prepared for the downside scenario with our cost management, and then as we got clearer sights of how the market or the quarter was going to play out, we managed against that baseline.  And as you heard, even from our builder customers, we just reflected the same sentiment they did at that point in time. And as you're hearing them now, they are also saying it was better than they expected. So it's kind of a combination of all of that. The only thing I'd add is we've got a really substantial backlog that gets us through 2023 and beyond. But that backlog is declining. In other words, we're completing jobs at a faster pace than we're filling the pipeline back up, because that sector in general is facing the same capital cost issues that the single-family sector is facing. And there's just kind of a pause or a hesitancy in that group to try to figure out what the value proposition going forward needs to look like.  We still believe, again long-term, housing demand wins, including in multifamily. But as there's a little bit of a recalibration of that capital cost, we are seeing jobs finished at a greater rate than jobs being entered into the pipeline out 12 months and beyond. Stanley, can you repeat the first question? You broke up. Yeah, thanks for that question. Within the multi-family segment for us, it's primarily value-add. We don't do a lot of non-value add with our multi-family customers and Truss is the overwhelming majority of the value-add. So it will always have a higher percent of multi-family sales as being value-add.  Now in the context of the overall business, it's still a fairly \u2013 it's 13% of our total business. So even in that context, it doesn't move the needle very much either way versus the single-family.  Now, what I will tell you, is our guys have done a great job where we have multi-family plants at capacity moving business to single-family plants that are under capacity. And that's the value of our platform and the ability to have, to manage the effectiveness of where we can build those Trusses in the most efficient way by having the availability of those single-family plants.  So there is a coordinated effort to build those Trusses where we can get the most efficient cost and it has to be within the radius of the job that we're trying to supply. But there's a lot of coordination that goes on there and a significant integration effort to make that happen. I think what you're saying is or asking about is the bank implications on demand, and as a result, what is that doing with our supply chain partners? I would tell you there are products that there is a little of additional capacity versus demand, but in general, our supply chain partners at this point in time have worked through where they had excess capacity in the first quarter and kept things at a normalized environment.  So they are still experiencing inflationary pressures in their business as well, specifically around labor, and they've been a little reluctant to get too aggressive, unless it was to balance the capacity versus on-hand situation, which pretty much worked itself out in the first quarter. So I think we're in that. You know the word of the day for the industry is stabilization. I think we're all in kind of a stable market and trying to be nimble and be able to respond either on the upside or the downside as necessary, and I think that's kind of where we are today. As far as the green shoots comment, I think what we're seeing from our customers is they are cautiously optimistic. Again, that things will be stable, and there are areas where things are showing the ability for demand to be resilient when mortgage rates are at a level where buyers enter into the market again.  Areas of the country that we've seen where that's a little better are where there's actual pockets of strength with real job growth versus what was somewhat of a boom during COVID that's kind of now receded. So again, mainly moving west to east is where we see it improving. And west is coming, starting to show signs of at least of leveling out. And the only other thing I'd add specifically around Truss is the premise around adding multifamily Truss was in market diversification from single-family. And that only works when you have the coordination between the single-family plants and the multi-family plants to be able to share work. And what we're doing really well is figuring that out and integrating that, and it accomplishes our objective to make sure when multi-family's hot, we're able to hit there, when single-family's hot we're able to hit there. Yeah. The productivity savings actually is also a component of margin where it relates to manufacturing, where we've gained manufacturing efficiencies. It actually is a positive contributor to our margin as well, so it's both. When we get it in the SG&A categories and the COGS categories through manufacturing efficiencies."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered exceptional gross margins in the first quarter, despite a challenging macro backdrop. The advantages of value-added products and services are evident and key to our outperformance.  We generated strong free cash flow as we leveraged our best-in-class operating platform and extended our track record of effective cost containment and working capital management. Our robust financial position, industry-leading products and solutions, and reputation for providing excellent customer service allow us to successfully navigate macro volatility and position us for above market growth in the years to come.  I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our second quarter guidance and provide an update on our illustrative full year scenarios. Let's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slide 10. We delivered $3.9 billion in net sales. Core organic sales decreased by 26%, attributable to a 34% decline in single-family due to slowing demand and compared to a strong first quarter of 2022. Multi-family was a bright spot that reflects the benefit of our expansion strategy in this category, growing by nearly 70%. The growth was driven by multiple acquisitions and a strong rental market. R&R and Other grew by more than 3%, mainly attributable to increased sales focus and capacity versus prior year.  The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately five percentage points of growth to net sales and one additional selling day had a favorable impact of 1%. While core organic sales and value added products decreased by nearly 17% due to slowing single family starts, this is almost 10 points better than the overall core organic result and underscores the resilience of the value added product portfolio. Importantly, value added products represented 56% of our net sales in the quarter, reflecting our position as the supplier of choice to these valuable high margin products.  During the first quarter, gross profit was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 25.2% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 300 basis points to 35.3%, with more than half of the 300 basis points change coming from our multifamily value added products and services. SG&A decreased $64.4 million to $904.2 million, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $46 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 630 basis points to 23.3%, primarily attributable to decreased leverage to net sales. We remain focused on disciplined cost management and are taking appropriate actions in response to volume dynamics on a market-by-market basis. As we have stated in the past, approximately 70% of SG&A expense is variable with volumes. We are striking the right balance between calibrating operations based on changes in volume and protecting capacity for future growth.  Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $632 million, a decline of 37%, primarily driven by lower net sales, including a decline in core organic products attributable to a slowing housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was a robust 16.3%.  Adjusted net income was $410 million, down from an adjusted net income of $701 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.96, compared to $3.90 in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EPS was favorably offset by our repurchase of more than 7.5 million shares or $0.15 per share during the quarter.  Our first quarter results beat the guidance we provided in February, supported by gross margin strength, as value-added products over-delivered and productivity came in faster than forecast. As a result, we are increasingly confident that our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 28% plus versus our previous expectation of 27% plus. Now, let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our first quarter operating cash flow was approximately $654 million, up from $180 million in the prior year, mainly attributable to disciplined working capital management and improved product mix, as well as effective pricing and cost management. Capital expenditures were $100 million. All in, we delivered robust free cash flow of approximately $554 million. Free cash flow yield is 28.5%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 47.1% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.8x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end our total liquidity was $1.4 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in net borrowing, availability under the revolving credit facility and $144 million of cash-on-hand.  Moving to capital deployment, during the first quarter we repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares for $628 million at an average stock price of $83.17 a share. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares so far in the second quarter for $348 million at an average stock price of $91.90. In total, we have repurchased 39% of our outstanding shares since August of 2021. As we have completed our prior share repurchase authorization, the Board of Directors decided to approve a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and will continue to look for organic and inorganic growth opportunities and to repurchase shares at an attractive value while maintaining our fortress balance sheet.  Now, I would like to discuss our guide on Slide 13. Given the ongoing challenging conditions in the housing market, we are continuing to provide quarterly guidance. We will reassess our full year guidance for actual and base business as the year progresses. For the second quarter we expect net sales to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 13.1% to 13.7%.  Our adjusted EBITDA guide for the second quarter assumes gross margins in the 32% to 34% range. Our second quarter guidance includes the following full year assumptions, which are also outlined in the earnings release and on Slide 14. We expect total capital expenditures in the range of $325 million to $375 million. This includes continued investments in scaling our value-added products. We expect interest expense in the range of $150 million to $170 million, an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%, depreciation and amortization expenses in the range of $525 million to $575 million, no change in the number of selling days versus the prior year. And finally, we expect to deliver between $90 million and $110 million in annual productivity savings.  We recognize that it is important to think about potential outcomes for the full year. So on Slide 15, we have updated our scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions.  As you can see, our strong Q1 performance and visibility into Q2 have meaningfully improved our expectations for each of the full year performance scenarios. Single-family starts are down 15% for the year, we now believe we could generate roughly $2.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which is up $500 million from our fourth quarter scenario analysis. This increased EBITDA expectation reflects stronger gross margins and productivity savings than we previously expected.  As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are exceptionally well positioned to drive our strategic goals forward. We believe that we can sustain a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year, and we continue to see the benefits of our transformed business. I believe that our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 28% or higher.  I'm confident in our best-in-class operating platform, will continue to set us up to generate substantial free cash flow, which provides further financial flexibility on top of our healthy balance sheet. We will also continue to diligently deploy capital and work to manage, to maximize long-term shareholder value.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks. Thanks, Matt. Yeah, no, it's a great question. We've been talking, about gross margins for quite a while now, ever since the merger and trying to get a sense of where normal is. We felt really good based on where the business was at that merger date. That 27% or better was something we felt good about on sort of a long-term normalized basis, taking out all the noise around supply chain and that type of thing.  But we were continuing to look at it, right? We've been looking at it, managing the business, but in the meantime, we've been working. So, we've worked to improve our value add as a percentage of the overall business, right. The acquisitions we've made, improving mix, it's grown faster, and it's been more resilient. So the biggest component being just the increased mix of value add on an ongoing basis, we think that's meaningful and important to our average gross margins over time.  In addition, we've done a really good job internally of managing productivity, even in a volume down market overall, certainly giving us a lot of confidence that the investments we've made in value add productivity and automation have yielded the benefits we were expecting. So those two factors are the most powerful. And the last one I think is, as we've seen a market as down as it was in Q1, and I think we can all admit, this was a challenging year-over-year compare, we still performed very, very well and that gives us the confidence that we needed to start moving that normalized margin up to 28% plus, because we see that as being really proof positive of the value of what that product does for our customers and for us. Sure. Yeah, and I'll let Dave talk to the overall market. What I would say is this is consistent with what we have been communicating. This still assumes that we're going to continue to see an increased competitive environment, a challenging volume environment in Q2, and normalization that continues to flow through in margins and sales. So while we're absolutely confident in the business, I don't want anybody to think that there still aren't some difficult comps coming, at least for the next quarter or two and that's really what you're seeing there in the numbers. So there's one question in 27 parts. I'll do my best and you can tell me if I hit all the points. The first one is around margins. I mean the difference between our guide, which is 28% plus on a normalized basis and what we've talked about in our guide for Q2 for example in the 30, you know mid to low 30s, low to mid 30s, yes you're right, there is a disconnect there.  We didn't provide explicit guidance around full year. I mean obviously those scenarios have some numbers embedded, but I think the message we're trying to send is we're in a very volatile environment still. We're seeing pretty significant step downs in volumes and while we have a much better sense of how the market is going to react, we haven't fully digested it.  So what we're saying in our numbers for this year is that we started exceptionally strong. That'll of course take our full year average in gross margins up above what we would consider to be normalized margins on an ongoing basis. But as we learn more and as we get better confidence, we'll continue to update that normalized number with our best understanding.  You know in terms of what has happened in the near term, I think one of the things that we've been pleasantly surprised by in recent periods has been the strength of gross margins, the resiliency of gross margins. While a big piece of that is mix, I think it's important to point out that our gross margin performance this quarter was really primarily driven by that multi-family investment that we've made.  That business as you know has longer lead times on their quote to delivery, which means there's a bit more exposure to commodities and in this environment that's a favorable thing. So there's some transitory benefit in there. We're certainly pleased with that business's performance overall and really happy to have it as part of the business. But those are the types of things we're accounting for when we're giving these normalized gross margin numbers. Did I hit all your points Mike? Yeah, and I think probably the first point is that, our thinking around that free cash flow conversion is probably north of $1.5 billion now, because of that call-off we said north of $1 billion in the past, so that's a significant increase in terms of what we're seeing. As you know Mike, some of that is really attributable to the slowdown in the business and the spinning off of some of the value on our working capital balance sheet. The reality is, we are performing quite well and we will continue to deploy capital in the strategy that we've outlined in the past. The board has been very supportive, whenever we need authorization, because we think we have cash to put to work, they'll be there for us and they're absolutely hand-in-glove with us on this strategy, so $1 billion seems fine for now, but we'll revisit it if it makes sense.  I mean the only thing I'll point out is, right, we're done with sort of the windfall benefit of the very, very high commodities, so some of the volumes of share buyback that we've seen over the past couple of years because of those commodities are past that. Well, it's certainly a nice part about that business is we do have a bit more visibility to the backlog. Right now it is substantial, because that part of the market has been strong and in somewhat surprising fashion has maintained its strength. I think there's absolutely a great profitability story in that world right now.  But as Dave mentioned, that will continue to normalize over time as the coal prices and the market prices of commodities tighten. But yeah, that's absolutely part of both, what allowed us to do the M&A in that sector of the market, but what we're enjoying in terms of the results so far this year and through all of 2023. Thank you. Yeah, I think as a general guideline we still like one to two times based business as a guideline that is helpful in terms of thinking about how to minimize our risk, but still take on an appropriate amount of it. It's a metric that if you think about base business in the last year, we'd say we have room, but we're certainly in the range, rather than if you just look at our trailing 12 actuals, it looks like we're a little bit under leveraged in that regard.  So as this business normalizes, as we get a better visibility into 2023 full year, we'll go ahead and update that base business, give you an updated thought process around the leverage ratio. But at this point, we feel pretty good about our borrowing, both the cost and the tenure and we'll continue to watch it. Thanks Stanley. Yeah, that's a tough question to answer. I think we continue to manage it on a flow-through basis, ensuring that we get the right margins for us. It's been a little bit of back and forth, I hear you. There have been some indications that taking capacity out might be helpful to put a floor under it. There's been some other murmuring, particularly on the OSB side about adding capacity. I think it's kind of range-bound right now, but it's tough to say. It's been such a surprising commodity over the last few years. I certainly don't feel comfortable predicting, but we're ready. Thanks Jay. Well, fair question. I would say overall we saw more resiliency in the market than we had forecasted. I think that's fair to say across the board. We saw the most resiliency in the geographically in the East, I would say product-wise in value-add. And in terms of the timing on that, I don't think there's anything strong indicating there is a time horizon that caused the results to be different, meaning each market is digesting what their demand looks like, each market is resetting and placing orders. But overall, I think it's been more orderly and more disciplined in terms of reacting to the step down in sales than we'd originally forecast. Yeah, I mean overall we're very excited about what value-add means in the long term. We've certainly moved the needle quite a bit in terms of our max being a 56% value-add this quarter, but we're not done. There's more opportunity geographically. There are more opportunities to have the full portfolio of products that we have in our offering in markets where it's not there yet. And I think where we ultimately expect to get to is if you look at the digital world, the ability to do more and more of that value-added [inaudible].  We're looking for ways to grow our ability to serve our customers, make them more efficient, help their total cost of build go down. So we're certainly excited about it. We think there's a lot of opportunity there still. You know, there's not a lot of great numbers in terms of share, so it's a little harder to talk about it that way, but we're certainly believers that there's much more to come. Thanks, Joe. Yeah, I think it's a little bit of a couple of those things. The completion certainly remains strong on those back of the building process products, windows, doors and millwork, a good example. I think there was quite a bit of disruption in that part of the market as well, which slowed the ability to put product on the ground when needed. So that's another big component, but we've also invested. So there's increased ability to serve as well. Yeah, no, you're right. We should have digested the bulk of all this commodity noise, the commodity volatility by next year. Q2 would be the biggest comp in terms of peak pricing hit in Q2 of last year. So it may drain a little bit into Q3, but Q2 is the biggest impact on a year-over-year basis, that's right. We can get back to you on that one. I don't actually have that narrow of a guide off the top of my head. Thank you. That is correct. Thanks David. Yeah. I mean, I think commodity pricing has been the headline that we've all talked about, but there's certainly been a lot of work done on the pricing in the non-commodity side. It's an area that I think really lends itself to the process and the discipline that we've implemented over the last five years or so. So certainly, a nice offset to the volume headwinds from the pricing side. Obviously not all of it, but certainly strong healthy pricing in that space. A chunk of it is absolutely attributable to the multi-family mix change and the profitability of that business. Thank you. Yeah. You know, free cash flow continues to be a bright spot for us. We actually generated a substantial amount in Q1, and you know that's a bit unusual for us. Some of that has to do with the resizing of the business on a year-over-year comparison basis. But we're still performing well, still quite profitable. So we're comfortable saying that we expect cash flows to be kind of north of that $1.5 billion range for 2023, based on sort of the most likely or middle over the path scenario that we provided. That's correct."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Rush: Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my prepared remarks, on behalf of Builders FirstSource, I want to send our thoughts to all of those who have been impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton. I am proud of how we have come together as an industry to help with disaster relief efforts in North Carolina and the Southeast. From the first morning after Helene's landfall, we had team members and suppliers reaching out from all over the region and even across the nation asking how they can help. Our Charlotte and Blairsville locations filled trucks with supplies and delivered them to the hard hit Western North Carolina region. Suppliers like Great Southern, BlueLinx, Weyerhaeuser, Orgle [ph] and many others immediately stepped up and joined our efforts. We are grateful to our partners for their help. And with BFS Cares initiative, we're providing grants to our team members -- to help get our team members back on their feet as soon as possible. I want to especially thank Tim McCall, an install manager in Nashville, who also serves as a volunteer firefighter in the region. Tim was involved in 20 calls in the first hours after Helene hit. One involved climbing over 250 yards of very unstable terrain to help rescue an 11-year-old boy who had been buried in the basement of his home by a massive land slide. Tim, we are so proud of your efforts, and thank you for your selfless service to the community. I'm sure you have all seen the news that I'm retiring as CEO. I never anticipated that 25 years ago, I would have this wonderful career with this great company. We have the best people in the industry and the opportunity to be CEO of BFS these last couple of years has truly been the joy and highlight of my career. I am so proud of how far we have come and I'm grateful to our leadership team and team members for their support. I have full confidence in Peter and Pete and their ability to drive our strategy forward. One of my first priorities when I became CEO was to develop a succession plan to ensure the consistency of our leadership and the execution of our long-term strategy. With many years of experience as our CFO, Peter is exceptional at navigating the public company landscape and has spent extra time with each of our regions to get a first-hand understanding of what it takes to support our leaders in the field. He has served as a close advisor to me and was essential in helping craft our current strategy. I'm working closely with him to ensure a thoughtful and seamless transition. Pete Beckmann is a brilliant financial leader and someone who is widely respected within the organization. I am grateful for our deep bench of talent and to lead BFS in such good hands. I want to wrap up by saying that I'm not going far away. I'll enjoy continuing to serve BFS as a member of our Board, and I am taking an active role to ensure a smooth transition in the near term. I'm excited to continue supporting our growth and success. Thank you, again. I'll now hand the call over to Peter.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying that we are indebted to Dave for his decades of service at BFS as a leader, steward and champion of the company and our people. Dave has truly done it all, and his legacy of excellence will continue to inspire us as we move forward. I'm truly honored and grateful to be named the next CEO of Builders FirstSource. I'm humbled to represent our talented, hard-working team and the fantastic business that we have built. BFS has had tremendous success and become a world-class organization because of the commitment and contributions made by this team. Let's get started with Slide 3 and our strategic pillars, which remain unchanged. As we continue to execute our strategy, I believe there are three areas that we can emphasize so we can continue to outperform today and transform tomorrow. The first opportunity is with our people. I want us to advance the industry standard in this area so that we are recognized as a premier destination for talent. I believe we can enhance how we invest in, develop and support our team members from our frontline operators to our leadership. The second opportunity is to further build and catalyze our growth prospects, from our products to our processes. I see potential to improve our consistency capabilities and ways of working, so we can extend our lead and grow a bigger, better BFS of tomorrow. And the third opportunity is to improve how we collaborate and learn from each other within the company. We have a wealth of expertise, knowledge and innovative technologies. I believe we have a real opportunity to enhance how we work together. So that what we are discovering in Charlotte is shared with Phoenix and what we are developing in Florida can be scaled in Texas. Let's turn now to our third quarter highlights on Slide 4. I'm proud of our resilient performance, which reflects our execution and operational rigor, even as we continue to see soft sales, amid rate uncertainty and extreme weather. Despite these challenges, we delivered strong gross margins of nearly 33%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin has remained in the mid-teens or better for 14 consecutive quarters, which highlights our transformed business model and our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Let's move to Slide 5, where we touch on some of the specific ways we are executing our strategy. Our portfolio of value-added products and services remains a competitive advantage for BFS and continues to bolster our partnerships with customers. We've seen steady progress with digital, as we continue to hear great feedback from customers and see increasing levels of adoption each week. We demonstrated operational excellence by delivering $27 million in productivity savings in Q3 and have driven $104 million year-to-date, primarily through more efficient manufacturing and procurement initiatives. Installed services continues to be a great opportunity for us as we leverage playbooks from successful markets. I'm pleased that our install sales increased by 11% year-over-year, as we focus on helping customers address labor challenges. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending and are continuing to maximize operational flexibility. We have consolidated 11 facilities year-to-date, while maintaining our service levels to our customers with an on-time and in-full delivery rate of over 90%. Single-family softness continued in Q3, amid on-going affordability challenges and below normal starts. The initial reaction to the Fed's first interest rate cut in September has been mixed, with some homebuyers remaining on the sidelines and waiting for additional rate cuts as mortgage rates fluctuate in the near term. As a reminder, the value of a new start has fallen as the housing market has adapted to affordability challenges. Multifamily continues to be a headwind, amid muted activity is expected. Comparisons should get less negative as we lap record performance from last year. On a normalized basis, multifamily represents about 9% to 10% of net sales and is an attractive and profitable business for us. As we detailed on our Q2 call, our Q4 exit velocity indicates about a percentage point of margin erosion from '24 on a full year basis, roughly half of which is from multifamily. To address the current environment and affordability challenges, builders have employed specs, smaller and simpler homes and interest rate buydowns to help buyers find affordable options. Builders of all sizes are having to navigate this market in addition to regulatory, land development and infrastructure challenges. Smaller builders have been especially impacted by the availability of land and limited options to buy down rates. We are leaning in by partnering with our customers to help them lower the cost of homes for consumers as well as maintain their margins. This includes offering a balanced product mix that addresses builder needs while passing through lower material costs. For instance, we have continued to supply more engineered wood and have sold fewer floor trusses to help alleviate affordability challenges. We have also supplied more lower-cost offerings in products like windows and doors to help reduce costs. Although these actions in support of our customers need less sales and gross profit dollars, our margin profile remains strong, and we are well positioned for growth as starts to increase and structural headwinds begin to subside. Turning to M&A on Slide 6, we continue to pursue attractive opportunities, while remaining financially disciplined. Over the years, we have developed a substantial and proven muscle memory to grow through M&A and have an impressive track record of successfully integrating these transactions. In the third quarter, we completed six deals with an aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $190 million. In July, we acquired Western Truss & Components, having trust capacity in the Flagstaff, Arizona area and CRi SoCal, a dealer and installer of high-end windows and doors in Orange County, California. In August, we acquired Wyoming Millwork, the leading independent building products distributor in Delaware. September, we acquired Sunrise Wood Designs, a top custom cabinet manufacturer and installer in North Texas. And in the Reno area, Reno Trust, a leading trust manufacturer to the single and multifamily markets and High Mountain Door & Trim, a distributor and installer of windows doors and in Millwork. Additionally, in October, we acquired Douglas Lumber, which provides a range of building materials to contractors, remodelers and homeowners in the Rhode Island area. These acquisitions reinforce our commitment to growing value-added products. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. On Slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. In addition to the six tuck-in acquisitions during the third quarter, we executed share repurchases of roughly $160 million. It's driven by our track record, we'll continue to allocate capital to high-return opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We deployed approximately $1.7 billion through the first three quarters of this year and remain on track strategically to $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026 and we outlined at Investor Day last December. Now let's turn to Slide 8, and discuss the latest updates on our digital strategy. With our BFS digital tools, we are focused on creating value for our homebuilder customers and in doing so, further extending our industry leadership position and driving substantial organic growth. We have seen strong adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller builders despite the challenging market. We have had broad acceptance of the platform so far, including interest from multiple top 200 builders. Since launching in late February, we have seen nearly $600 million of orders placed through our digital platform, of which $83 million were incremental sales from existing and new customers. While we're very pleased with the incremental sales to date, given market headwinds from our targeted segment of builders, we now expect total incremental sales of approximately $110 million in 2024 versus our initial goal of $200 million. Despite the slow start, we remain confident in our ability to meet our target of $1 billion in incremental sales in 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers. Before I turn the call over, I want to say that we are very fortunate to have Pete Beckmann step into the role of CFO. He has a long proven track record as a finance leader which I've witnessed first-hand. I look forward to partnering with him to deliver exceptional results and compound shareholder value. Pete, take it away.\nPete Beckmann: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the introduction, and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve as CFO. For background, I have spent the last 25 years at BFS and legacy companies in roles of increasing responsibility, including being an integral part of the ProBuild and BMC mergers. Most recently, I served as SVP of Financial Planning and Analysis, where we have partnered with all levels of the enterprise and was responsible for our financial forecasting, strategic capital and annual planning. I look forward to helping enable profitable growth while maintaining our track record of prudent financial management through the cycle and disciplined capital allocation. Despite continued housing market choppiness we delivered resilient results during the third quarter as we continue to execute our strategy and operating model. We are leveraging our fortress balance sheet and free cash flow generation to drive disciplined capital deployment, as witnessed by our share repurchases and acquisitions during the quarter. Our scale and financial flexibility enable us to act as key partners to homebuilders, and we have a clear line of sight to compound value creation over the long term. We are well positioned for meaningful operating leverage when the market turns. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our third quarter results; second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment; and finally, I'll discuss our 2024 guidance, 2025 scenarios and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on Slides 9 and 10. Net sales were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 6.7%, driven by a 7.2% decline in core organic sales as multifamily continues to trend downward, and 2.9% of commodity deflation. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 2% and one additional selling day that contributed 1.4%. The organic sales decrease was driven by a 31% decline in multifamily as we lap the prior year's strong comps and a 4.6% decline in single-family amid lower value per start. This was partially offset by a small increase in repair and remodel of almost 1%, given strength in the central region. As we have shared on recent calls, there have been three main variables reconciled single-family starts for organic sales. The first variable is the lag between permits and starts. This quarter, unlike last quarter, we have seen the impact of early permit polls stay where we continue to see a generally extended permit completion cycle time. As a rule of thumb, we expect a roughly two-month lag between the start and our first setting. Second, the value of the average home has fallen as size and complexity have decreased. Finally, we have seen slight normalization in selling margins of non-commodity products and manufacture price cuts in some products. Summarized, although there are sales dollars built for start today, we remain the market leader and will begin to deliver strong operating performance. Value-added products represented 49% of our net sales during the third quarter. As a rule of thumb, our multifamily sales are made up of roughly 70% value-added products. Gross profit was $1.4 billion, a decrease of approximately 12% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 32.8%, down 210 basis points, primarily driven by multifamily and core organic normalization. SG&A increased $19 million to $958 million, primarily attributable to acquired operations and asset write-offs, partially offset by lower variable compensation due to lower net sales. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 190 basis points to 22.6%. Adjusted SG&A decreased approximately $1 million to $783 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation due to lower net sales, partially offset by acquired operations. On an annual basis, adjusted SG&A is approximately 30% fixed and 70% variable with volumes. For reference, we have an adjusted SG&A reconciliation schedule in the earnings release. We are focused on carefully managing our SG&A expenses and are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $627 million, down 23%, primarily driven by lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.8%, down 310 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments. Adjusted net income of $360 million was down $174 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments and lower income tax expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.07, a decrease of 28% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.22 per share for the third quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 11. Q3 operating cash flow was $730 million, an increase of $81 million, mainly attributable to a decrease in net working capital. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $95 million, and free cash flow was approximately $635 million. For the last 12 months ended September 30th, our free cash flow yield was approximately 8% while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 25%. Our trailing 12 months net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4x, while base business leverage was 1.5x. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $2 billion, consistent of $1.7 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $300 million in cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment. During the third quarter, we repurchased roughly 900,000 shares for approximately $160 million at an average stock price of $176.73 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August 2021, we have repurchased 45.5% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $77.62 per share for $7.3 billion. We have approximately $840 million remaining on our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns. On Slide 12, we show our 2024 outlook. We anticipate a regional financial impact from Hurricane Helene and Milton, around $40 million in sales, a relatively modest amount given our geographic diversification. For full year 2024, we have narrowed our range of expected total company net sales to be $16.25 billion to $16.55 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.2%. We expect our 2024 full year gross margin guide to be in the range of 32% to 33%. This also remains in line with our long-term expectation of 30% to 33% and normalized single-family starts of $1 million to $1.1 million. We expect full year 2024 full year gross margin guide to be in the range of 32% to 33%. This also remains in line with our long-term expectation of 30% to 33% and normalized single-family starts of $1 million to $1.1 million. We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, assuming average commodity prices in the range of $380 to $400 per 1,000 board feet. 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for a list of these key assumptions. Moving to Slide 14. We recognize that 2025 is coming into focus as we approach year-end. Like we did last year, we have laid out a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions. I want to emphasize that this is not guidance, but these scenarios should help clarify our range of performance expectations for 2025 and demonstrate the strength of our best-in-class operating platform. Turning to slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and resiliency of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $15.4 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.3 billion at a margin of 14%, which reflects a minimal impact from commodities. For context, Slide 16 shows that our 2020 base business adjusted EBITDA was roughly $1.1 billion and 991,000 single-family starts, and we are expecting better adjusted EBITDA at lower single-family starts this year. On Slide 17, we provide a bridge from our 2019 gross margin to the long-term normalized midpoint of 31.5%. Our improved margin profile has a greater mix of value-added products, productivity savings and commercial benefits. As I wrap up, I am confident in our ability to execute our strategy and drive long-term growth by leveraging our exceptional platform and financial flexibility. The Investor Day goals we laid out last December remain achievable, assuming a return to normalized single-family starts of $1.1 million in 2026. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Peter for some final thoughts.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Pete. Let me close by reiterating that we continue to execute. Our resilient business model allows us to win in any environment, and this is evidenced by our strong gross profit margins and cash flow generation in the third quarter. I'm confident in the long-term strength of our industry due to the significant housing underbuilt and favorable demographic trends. We are well positioned to take advantage of these tailwinds, which will help drive growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We are a key partner to our customers and continue to deepen our value proposition by helping them solve problems through our investments in value-added products, digital tools and install services. Our proven playbook for growth, fortress balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Even in an uncertain and challenging environment, we are doing the hard work now and building for the future. By continuing to grow in value add and install along with leveraging IT and technological development, we are arming our team members with cutting-edge tools to continue to be the supplier of choice for our customers. By investing today, we are exceptionally well positioned to win in the future as the market continues to recover. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, please open the call now for questions. As a reminder, with a lot of questions this morning, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. I want to offer my congratulations and best wishes to Dave and best of luck to Peter and Pete. So, for my first question, I wanted to touch on your growth versus the market into these 2025 scenarios. So kind of looking into the second half here, I think the way you guys outlined the guide is, you obviously reduced the revenue guide by a bit while holding the end market guide. So, I'm curious around your balance of share and kind of how you're thinking about that in the near term. But then as you draw it into those '25 scenarios, it looks like you're talking about your growth relatively similar to the start number. So, I'm curious how you're thinking about your growth relative to market as we get into 2025 as well. And if some of these headwinds are starting to abate any visibility to that. I'll stop there, but thank you guys.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. Yes, there's a lot in that question. So, a couple of factors. I would say where we are today, we have certainly seen the choppiness in the market. There wasn't a big relief rally when interest rates were cut, mortgage rates didn't necessarily behave as everyone was hoping in terms of a quick fall. And I think buyers have been appropriately or inappropriately nervous about both rates and the election. So, it's been a little choppy. I think we've seen that. We've been watching it all year. Still performing well. I think the business is still competing well, taking advantage of opportunities, we're investing. Those things have led to, I think, some solid performance on our part, but we have certainly faced headwinds. We've been hopefully pretty open about that. The value of these homes has fallen. That's really the biggest disconnect. when we look at what starts have done and what our sales have done, particularly in that single-family core organic category. That doesn't mean we're not happy and competitive. But certainly, it's been challenging out there, and we've talked about that. As we think about what that means into the fourth quarter and into next year, I think, broadly speaking, it's mixed out there. You've got markets that are doing quite well. They're sort of bouncing up and seeing some green shoots starting to perform. We've got other markets that have struggled and seen headwinds and seen a little bit of excess inventory and builders are reacting in a thoughtful way, we believe, to managing that. So, our guide for the fourth quarter is certainly focused on the visibility that we have into the market, the conversations we're having with customers, it's not a bad market by any stretch, but it's one that has certainly seen some challenges, not at all helped by the weather disruptions that we've seen. As we get into '25, it's early days. We\u2019ve been looking at the commentary from the economists. We've been talking with our customers. It's a bit of a mixed bag, some doing better than others. We think there will be a bit of a differentiated reaction as rates are cut. We expect there will likely be at least a couple of more. We think mortgage rates will continue to settle that will have different advantages to different builders out in the market. So, this is what we're seeing today. There's certainly new news, some of the performance announcements over the past few weeks have saved our opinions as we go forward. But we thought like last year, this is a helpful starting point for helping people understand what we're thinking based on what we see today.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Thank you for that Peter and for addressing my long question there. Second one, the gross margin guide. I just wanted to confirm that given where the guide is that you're still looking at roughly 31% as the exit rate for 2024. And again, obviously, we can see the margin numbers in your 2025 scenarios. But between some of the pluses and minuses, productivity, value add, install, versus some of the competitive dynamics out there. How are you guys thinking that 31% could drift one way or the other as you go through 2025?\nPete Beckmann: Matt, thank you for the question. We're seeing a headwind as we exit 2024, of about another 100 basis points from the year-to-date average margin, 100 basis points, pretty consistent with what we said last quarter is half of it is made up from the multifamily normalization and the other half from the core business normalization. It is a competitive environment. We're going to continue to compete, especially on the commodity products with the install. Install has been a favorable result for us in 2024, and it continues to be a good arrow in the quiver, and we'll continue to compete every day and we expect to exit right around 31.5. Overall, we're certainly very pleased with the margin performance despite the challenging market, we've seen customers really continuing to benefit from the value-added products and services. That part of our business has certainly stayed strong, stay resilient, and it supported our margins in an environment where volumes are and values are down a little bit.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay, so you said 31.5 is the exit rate. So, I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys.\nPete Beckmann: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Charles Perron-Piche with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCharles Perron-Piche: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First of all, congrats, Dave, Peter and Pete on the promotion and retirement. Well, deserved. Maybe if I can go first to -- going back to Matt's question on the 2025 scenario. I just want to make sure that we understand this correctly, looking at the base case scenarios. It implies approximately 20% incremental EBITDA margin in 2025 once we moved it to $100 million of multifamily headwind. First of all, is that right? And as you see things flowing through next year, how do you see the ability to drive the gross margin versus the SG&A leverage across those scenarios? And just to follow up as well, do you see the deceleration in the sales that you've seen through 2024 in terms of the content per home as stabilizing and expecting through 2025 to be roughly consistent with what you see today in those scenarios?\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Charles. Appreciate the comments and the questions. So, I would say the numbers and the performance of the business around margins in particular, there's a lot going on there, right? With the early look at what we have on the table, I think what it reveals is continuing performance in the areas that you'd expect us to deliver. We expect to see improved performance as a result of productivity initiatives. We continue to see the strength around the value-add. We continue to look for opportunities within that productivity category to drive both gross margins and EBITDA margins. That is, I would say, a core part of our operating model as a business and something you feel good about as time progresses. The dynamics around how the market will perform next year in light of the sales volumes in the various categories. I think broadly speaking, we continue to see weakness in multifamily. I would say our sense of it is it's stabilized, but it's been a big step down from the peak, but gotten to a level where we believe we can hold here and hopefully, start to see some recovery timing will depend on the dynamics of the market. Single family is a dynamic that's different between the types of builders, as I mentioned earlier, but certainly 1 that we think is directionally headed in a positive way. We continue to believe in the strength of the market, the desirability of new homes and the industry's ability to deliver those. We think there's a lot of pent-up demand and we are well positioned to help builders deliver and do it in a very efficient way. This -- again, early days on this guide, but for '25, but we think those scenarios can help add some color in that regard.\nCharles Perron-Piche: Okay. That's helpful, Peter. And maybe following up, where product prices in lumber in particular, have been trending higher over the last couple of months with the improving housing outlook for 2025, suggesting potentially more upside. I guess against this, how are you positioning your inventories in the business? And how do you see this recovery in commodity prices affecting demand and competitive dynamics across the different value-add products that you have in your portfolio if this ongoing upswing persist in 2025?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. So commodities continue to be an important part of what we do, although we are much smaller than it has in the past. It's nice to see the prices bouncing off the bottom. I'd say that below 400 window that we were in for a while was a bit, I would say, unpleasant more so for the mills and the delivery on the commodity side than for us. But certainly, we like to have a healthy sector in the commodity space and that lumber -- the dimensional lumber in OSB space in particular. We have seen a little bit of a boost I think it's early days. And I would highlight the fact that while new construction is an important driver of demand in that product category, R&R, the Repair and Remodel market is a far bigger influence. So, I think that's where, if I'm looking for support and tailwind in that category, that's an important factor to keep an eye on. You hit the nail in the head, it will certainly be a tailwind for sales and for margins as we see better absorption of our overhead costs. If that continues to increase in costs. Although, as always, we keep a close eye on affordability. We want to balance there. We not think any of us want to return to the $1,300 to $1,600 lumber days. That was pretty dysfunctional. So, a modest increase is, I think, healthy and good to stabilize the market.\nCharles Perron-Piche: Okay. Thanks for your time, guys.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Mike Dahl with RBC. Please go ahead.\nMike Dahl: Morning, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats again to Dave, Peter and Pete. I want to start with gross margins and maybe a two-parter on both the contributors to the quarter and then thinking about that fourth quarter comment. I mean when you look at the outperformance in gross margin in the quarter, how would you bucket it out in terms of what -- whether or not there was some benefit from the rising wood-based product costs in the quarter versus maybe give us a sense of kind of on the recent M&A, whether the margin accretion from that or install, like if you could quantify any of any of that or kind of digital, really just what the drivers are? And similarly, looking into 4Q, it seems like your outlook slightly better than it than it was before. So, if you can talk to those contributing factors or any quantification there, that would be great.\nPete Beckmann: Morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. With respect to fee performance and margin, we continue to see a normalization in the multifamily space. We continue to have positive uplift from productivity that we continue to deliver. And the rest of it is mix and mix within the core business, and it continues to deliver resilient margins better than what we had expected originally when we gave guidance last quarter. As we look forward to Q4, we continue to see margin normalization in the multifamily, which is a broken record, and we continue to share that each quarter and some continued pressure and normalization in the core business due to the competitive environment that we're still in. And part of it is going to be some of the seasonal build, and we'll see some of that volume kind of shoulder off as we exit the year.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I think Pete's right on in terms of the key drivers. We continue to be under a bit of pressure on the competitive dynamic. You'll see some seasonality but I think, in general, what you're seeing is the continued strength of the core product offerings and the value add in terms of something that we have made a core part of what we do and has continued to be strong.\nMike Dahl: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then my second question, look, it's on the '25 scenarios, and I understand it is early days, as you say. But when I look across your range of start outcomes. I think some of the builders more recently have been a little more subdued in their outlooks than what some of these ranges would imply certainly the middle or upper ranges. And then taking into account the some of the mix factors that have played out this year, it seems like your revenue guide, it might be suggesting that you actually go back to outpacing the starts environment. So, two kinds of big assumptions in there in terms of some improvement in the overall market and then some improvement relative to that. I was hoping you could talk to that more how you built that and whether or not there are some bigger moving pieces in terms of like, okay, well, you're assuming x for digital and like some carryover M&A. Or maybe just help us kind of bridge when you both -- how you thought about starts, but also then framing your revenue versus starts, what some of those other big moving pieces are?\nPeter Jackson: Sure. I can provide a little bit of color. I won't go into too much detail, but you're right. There's a lot that goes into it. No question. I would say the starting point is maybe where we're most maybe disconnected based on your comments and your concern about the overall starts we, at this stage of the game aren't folding in a lot of commentary, we're folding in mainly the economist forecasts and the averages of the leading forecasters around the start numbers. While an individual builder is certainly important and an important partner for us. There's no one builder that's going to move the entire market. So we generally will stay at the economist level forecasting for starts, especially at the point we're at in early November. We do have assumptions in there for commodity prices, for the M&A carryover for productivity. We've got certainly an expectation that we'll be able to gain share with some of the initiatives we've leaned hard into things like digital and install. And I think it's fair to say that our thinking around the average cost per start is aligning around it flattening out for the most part. We haven't seen continued decline. It's been more stable. I would say, since mid-summer on a year-over-year basis, we've certainly seen the comparisons, and we've tried to call those out, but it hasn't been something that's aggressively moved down after the reset earlier this year. So that's another variable that's included. But like I said, early days some high-level analytics, we tried to be inclusive of the variables that we think are important. But as you know, this is a challenging game given how volatile things are lately.\nMike Dahl: Okay, I appreciate that Peter. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations to everyone. My first question is clarification on Slide 17. When you talk about productivity, does that capture both process improvements as well as scale? And then could you also define other commercial benefits just definitionally for us?\nPeter Jackson: Dave, thank you. I'm going to let Pete handle that one.\nPete Beckmann: Yes. So within the productivity savings, that's process improvements. The scale that we get from the company really helps us leverage our knowledge and our expertise across the platform. But the productivity savings is process improvement on how we do things and how well we're buying, how well we're manufacturing and how well we're operating on a daily basis. Within the other commercial benefits of saying that there's customer supplier terms. We've talked about in the past where we used to have longer fixed-price contracts. We've worked to eliminate those, shorten the duration. So we don't get pinched or absorbing all the commodity risk. Our CRM tools that we put in place and how well we're managing our relationships with our customers and falling through, and that's where some of the scale is going to come into play. So you'll see that in the bullets on the side of that chart.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you and Peter Jackson, you might have just described this, but I want to be clear. You talked about the trends in single-family housing sizes. And I'm just wondering, in those scenarios, are you assuming any improvement or deterioration for that matter in any of those scenarios. It sounds like you're seeing that trend basically flatten out. Is that my understanding?\nPeter Jackson: That's right. Yes. There are a bunch of pieces in there, certainly square footage of the home being one, but mix of products in the home value of those same products that are appearing in the home, all part of that. But yes, we're expecting it to flatten out based on what we're seeing right now. Little bit of a lapping impact but pretty modest.\nDavid Manthey: That's great. Okay. Thank you very much.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go now to Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And best of luck to Dave, and congrats to Peter and Pete. Just on the manufactured product segment, the year-over-year decline -- would it be possible if you could talk a little bit about the impact of the multifamily, specifically multifamily trusses relative to everything else? Like obviously, multi-families sort of going through that normalization. But excluding that, what are you seeing in terms of the manufactured product like revenue trends? And any commentary on margins there would be helpful.\nPete Beckmann: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Peter. What you're seeing in the manufacturing products, specifically on the multifamily side. We've been talking about the normalization, but also the volume declines that we've seen in that multifamily space. As a reminder, I mentioned in our prepared remarks that multifamily may value-added products was 70% of the multifamily overall. That used to be a much higher percent and that's also come down. And in the quarter or what we're seeing within multifamily, manufactured products is down almost 45% to 50% within that multifamily mix. We're anticipating that, that's going to continue to decline as what we're seeing from the starts and the volume normalize as we'd lap the higher year. The tough comps that we had last year was the peak, and Q3 being the highest point of that. It's just a big headwind, but we're seeing more stable volume and it's normalizing at a bottom as we exit the year.\nPeter Jackson: Yes. And I think just broadly speaking, the multifamily trust has been hardest hit. The multifamily work part of the business has performed a bit better, been a bit more stable. The team has competed well and found other opportunities to protect the business. I think that the side, the single-family side has certainly seen pressure, particularly in that category that we highlighted in the spoken remarks about floor trusses and the shift back to EWP. I think that's probably the only other color that I would add there. In general, we're still pleased with manufactured products in general. I think it's performing well from a support to customer perspective, from an affordability perspective, from a competitive dynamic, we feel good about and it's a productivity source for us. But it certainly on a comp basis has been challenging.\nRafe Jadrosich: That's helpful. And then just on the gross margin bridge that you provided from 2019 to today, which is super helpful. The value-add portion that can you talk about how much of that is the margins changing within value-add relative to just value-add mix moving higher? And then like is there any changes we anticipate from the value-add margins today going forward?\nPeter Jackson: There's a lot in there, right? I mean we've done a ton of acquisitions. We've added a ton of capacity. We've made tremendous investment. A lot of that had to do with productivity savings within the category itself that sort of generated through the size and scale of those operations. So there's certainly a lot in there. The performance generally speaking, I would say, is sustainable from the perspective that we have a lot more to offer. We have a wider portfolio and geography coverage than we did in the past. So I think that's the exciting part about where we can continue to grow this business into the future. That expansion of install, the investments we've made in that business over the years being harvested as we return to growth. I think that's an exciting history for us, but even more exciting is what the future holds in that category.\nRafe Jadrosich: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Philip Ng with Jefferies.\nPhilip Ng: Hi, guys. Congrats on a solid quarter now, choppy environment. I guess to kind of kick things off. When you look at your scenarios for 2025, is there any assumption that mortgage rates actually pull back from here? And what are you assuming for non-commodity products from a pricing standpoint. And certainly, very great to see an upbeat view on the market in your various scenarios. Peter, it would be helpful to kind of give us some perspective. As you kind of pointed out, the market is still pretty choppy, what that earnings power or margin profile could look like if single-family starts are actually flat to down low single digits?\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Philip, for your four questions. Let me try and jump at a couple of them and you can correct me in point me back in the direction you want me to go. We -- what I would say about the 2025 scenarios, we didn't do a downside. We could do a downside. I think generally speaking, like I said, the economists aren't signalling a downside. So it if that develops over time where we need to put something out there, we certainly can. We've done it in the past. We're not going to be shy about it. That hasn't been the predominant thinking in the recent past. I think that the ability of this business to perform in the downside is pretty positive. We have demonstrated the ability to size ourselves to be competitive to get after it, ability to protect and hold margins to do it by partnering with customers with products that they want. So I think that's probably the theme that I want to go with. You point me in a couple of other points you want me to highlight.\nPhilip Ng: Your various scenarios, Peter, are you assuming any pullback in mortgage rates and how are you thinking about pricing of your products, not commodity?\nPeter Jackson: So we don't have an explicit mortgage rate assumption in any of our stuff. I think what happens is it's basically embedded or implicit in what the economists are doing. My sense is most of them are taking the middle of the road dot plot and trying to step off of that, but we don't have an explicit assumption for it. In terms of pricing, I will say our sense from what we've seen from some vendors is that the era of cuts is ended. What we're seeing right now is stability in pricing in some modest, maybe low single-digit price increases. We'll see where that pans out. It's a little early to be calling that yet, but that's the tone right now.\nPhilip Ng: Okay. That's super helpful. And then my next question is around M&A. How is the pipeline looking? Have you seen sellers come back to the market with some level of stabilization? And how do you kind of size the opportunities in front of you, smaller or larger deals in general?\nPeter Jackson: Well, yes, I mean, there's no question the market is looking strong. I mean with six this quarter, I'd say the pipeline is strong. Smaller deals, by and large it make up this number, no question, but there are a number of really nice looking businesses out there. I would say that sellers have come to the market with an intent to sell. They're not exploring. They're looking to move, but a pretty wide portfolio of items that we're looking at and continue to look at it. It's a good time to be buying stuff.\nPhilip Ng: Okay. Appreciate all the great color, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nJay McCanless: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations to everyone and thank you to you guys and your suppliers for helping out with the hurricane relief, really important work. So the first question I had going back to Slide 17, I guess could you talk about what you saw improved from last quarter to this quarter that gave you the confidence to go ahead and move the gross margin number up and the EBITDA margin up?\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Jay. Talking about 17, that's the long range view. So one of the things we had done during Investor Day was to give people a rough estimate around what we think normalized gross margins were going to be between 30% and 33%. A frequent question that we received was wait a minute, help me get my head around this. What are the big pieces that I should understand if I bridge you from pre-BMC merger to what you're telling me is the future of this business. And we were a little hesitant to lay that out there until we have a little better understanding of what normalization was going to look like. And as things have kind of calmed down and we feel like there's a clearer line of sight to what this business is and how it will continue to perform. We decided to put this out for everybody to understand the buckets of what has driven it, where we have gotten our sort of inputs to defend that midpoint of 30% to 33%, which is about 31.5%. So this isn't a Q4 or a '25 thing. This correlates back to the 2026 target for us for Investor Day.\nJay McCanless: Okay. Great. And then I guess the other question I had, Peter, you talked earlier about R&R being a much larger consumer of lumber than single-family starts. I guess could you talk to again what you guys are expecting for R&R this coming year and maybe what the industry kind of outlook is just so we know where things might go?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. I mean -- if you look at the overall, I want to -- just to clarify based on what we've seen from a couple of different sources, R&R is probably in DIY is about half of the demand for lumber and sort of the commodity product. We're closer to quarter or third with the rest of it being industrial and commercial. So certainly, that DIY R&R space is more important the tone has been pretty good. I think the sense is that there is a lot of pent-up demand for renovations as the housing stock in this country ages. There are certain commentators will, for example, who's pretty -- I won't say excited, but positive about what R&R can do if we start to see a little bit of pullback in the mortgage rates and it starts to release a little bit of that lock-in effect that people have experienced since mortgage rates went up. So that would certainly be a tailwind a balancing out in the market, I think a revival of what that represents for demand on the construction industry. I think all of that is pretty favorable for Builders FirstSource on balance. So that's certainly a positive we look forward to. Pretty modest and from what we see so far in the forecast for '25 itself, but over sort of '25, '26-ish we think there's good momentum there.\nJay McCanless: Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking my question.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks Jay.\nOperator: We'll go now to Jeffrey Stevenson with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Stevenson: Hi, thanks for taking my questions today and congrats, Dave, Peter and Pete. So productivity savings are coming in better than expected this year through efficient manufacturing and procurement initiatives. I just wondered how long a runway do you have on the strong product it savings benefits you've seen over the last few years, and should we expect this trend to continue in 2025?\nPeter Jackson: Thanks. Yes. Productivity is something this organization is really engaged in very effectively sharing of best practices, working together on feed ideas, ways of doing business that just takes out waste and inefficiencies at a real fundamental level has been super successful. We think there's more opportunity for that, but I won't overstate the impact of the transition that we'll see over the next couple of years towards our ERP conversion. So there has to be a balance there, both take a lot of time and energy from the organization. So we'll continue to balance it out from a timing perspective. But there's zero question, I would say, in my mind and in the minds of the operating leaders that we can continue to get better, that we can continue to drive productivity savings well into the future. I think we're just in the early innings of what we can do with just a fantastic business and a wonderful platform, particularly as we take advantage of technology and better tools for our teams.\nJeffrey Stevenson: Okay. That's great to hear, Peter. And then I was wondering if you could talk more about the trade-off you're seeing, the lower value products such as an example in your prepared remarks of builders using EWP instead of floor trusses from the focus on lower value in complex home. I just wondered, how widespread is this across regions and do you expect it to continue well into 2025?\nPeter Jackson: Well, we're certainly seeing it everywhere. I would say every homebuilder in their own way is trying to adapt to the affordability challenges. It's tough for home buyers just given the world that we live in to afford these new prices. And so we're all looking for ways to do what we do more efficiently. So whether it's size of the home, whether it's value of the products that are going in being a little more sharper with the pencil in terms of pricing or -- and this is, I think, more direct to your comment what's the mix of products that are going to show up in the actual, the home itself. I think you've seen even today announcements from manufacturers of building materials that have pointed to negative mix people have moved to the simpler, cheaper option in order to make sure the price point for these homes match up to the monthly payment capability of the current homebuilder. I think it has been a bit of a two years step down. We're not seeing the continued pace of those declines. They seem to have stabilized to a large degree. That's not to say we won't see some shifts in individual product categories. But I think what we have seen throughout the back half of this year so far, has been a more stable output in terms of what is going into homes, size of the homes, value of the products, that sort of thing.\nJeffrey Stevenson: Very helpful. Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.\nSteven Ramsey: Good morning. Wanted to ask on the R&R and other category, another quarter of solid organic growth versus the backdrop. I'm curious if you could share a bit more on the central region strength versus other regions? What is allowing you to outperform? And then maybe lastly, just to make my second question wrapped up into this, how much is value-added products a factor in this category? Thanks\nPeter Jackson: So maybe second question first. Certainly, a smaller component of the R&R business. That is more varied from a product perspective, a lot more categories go through that. Just given the nature of what we sell and where we sell it. Certainly, a bit of variance between the individual divisions between those markets. I would say we've had some pretty nice success in some of our smaller markets, particularly in the North Central around the R&R space. They performed well. But in general, I think it's a strength for us just as we continue to have available capacity and open our doors to the smaller remodeler. We have a lot of value that we can provide them with subject matter expertise and product knowledge. And generally, we do have success in that category when we focus on it. But just to repeat it, it's a fairly small percentage of our overall business.\nSteven Ramsey: Great, thank you.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Steven.\nOperator: And we'll hear next from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: Thank you. Coming back to multifamily. In -- when you talk about 2025, you've got 400 million to 500 million revenue sort of decline. Is that more of just lapping sort of year-over-year sort of deterioration as you move through 2024? Or are you sort of factoring in sort of further declines in 2025 because it's still a pretty meaningful sort of year-over-year drop?\nPeter Jackson: It's primarily lapping. Yes. It's -- I would say we stabilized, but the lapping effect will still be there.\nKetan Mamtora: Understood. And on the margin normalization side, both for multi-family and for single-family. Are you seeing signs that we are sort of closer to the end there in terms of sort of the competitive price pressures? Or is it sort of still continuing as we move into Q4 and next year?\nPete Beckmann: With the multifamily margin normalization, it's continuing to wane and fade. As we said on prior calls, we think it's going to kind of normalize out by Q1 of next year, but we're really hitting that exit rate. And most of the normalization you see in the results is a year-over-year comp to the prior year's strength that we had.\nPeter Jackson: I'd say overall, we're in late innings. We're much closer to the end in terms of the margin normalization. We certainly have teed up that 100 basis point sort of based on the exit velocity that we're seeing I don't want to miss the opportunity to highlight we're still well below normal starts. So that certainly creates pressure. But based on where we came from, we believe we're much closer than the beginning.\nKetan Mamtora: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Alex Rygiel with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you, gentlemen. A very nice quarter. As it relates to the installed sales, which increased about 11% in the quarter, what percentage of your overall net sales is that today? And how does that impact your gross margin?\nPeter Jackson: So the 11% is a year-to-date improvement over the prior year. The margin profile on install is kind of at our normal mix across because we're installing products Windows, Doors, Millwork, as well as some framing and trusses and siting and other products. So it's very complementary to the overall margins that we have across all the product categories. Size of install, I think you want to know. So install was about -- I think it was 2.5 billion, 2.6 billion last year. It's increased. So it's going to be a relative increase from that.\nAlex Rygiel: And then as it relates to digital tools, given where we are in the housing cycle, how should we think about that as it relates to sort of your marketing of the product and its receptivity to the product?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, I'm glad you asked that question. So digital is -- it's still very exciting. The product works -- it is absolutely cutting edge and unique in the industry in terms of what we can do versus any competition that exists out there. But it's new, right? It's technology in an industry that hasn't historically adopted it quickly. And it's a different way of thinking about how to be more efficient. We've got a lot of really good momentum it's certainly hard. I will confess, it's maybe even harder than we gave it credit for, but it's worked. And so we're continuing to lean in, continuing to partner with homebuilders continuing to leverage our team internally to utilize the tools and to help customers get comfortable with the tools. But given our focus on the sort of 50 to 250 starts a year builder, and how much pressure they've been under over the past couple of years because of rates, it's been challenging. I do believe this is one way they can compete, that they can be more efficient that they can be more professionalized and make their business better and more competitive against the big guys. So we think, ultimately, it will be a positive. But certainly, in the near term, it's serving a market that's been under pressure. No question.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you very much.\nOperator: As there are no further questions at this time, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session and the Builders FirstSource third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful rest of your day.",

            "name": "Dave Rush",
            "content": "Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my prepared remarks, on behalf of Builders FirstSource, I want to send our thoughts to all of those who have been impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton. I am proud of how we have come together as an industry to help with disaster relief efforts in North Carolina and the Southeast. From the first morning after Helene's landfall, we had team members and suppliers reaching out from all over the region and even across the nation asking how they can help. Our Charlotte and Blairsville locations filled trucks with supplies and delivered them to the hard hit Western North Carolina region. Suppliers like Great Southern, BlueLinx, Weyerhaeuser, Orgle [ph] and many others immediately stepped up and joined our efforts. We are grateful to our partners for their help. And with BFS Cares initiative, we're providing grants to our team members -- to help get our team members back on their feet as soon as possible. I want to especially thank Tim McCall, an install manager in Nashville, who also serves as a volunteer firefighter in the region. Tim was involved in 20 calls in the first hours after Helene hit. One involved climbing over 250 yards of very unstable terrain to help rescue an 11-year-old boy who had been buried in the basement of his home by a massive land slide. Tim, we are so proud of your efforts, and thank you for your selfless service to the community. I'm sure you have all seen the news that I'm retiring as CEO. I never anticipated that 25 years ago, I would have this wonderful career with this great company. We have the best people in the industry and the opportunity to be CEO of BFS these last couple of years has truly been the joy and highlight of my career. I am so proud of how far we have come and I'm grateful to our leadership team and team members for their support. I have full confidence in Peter and Pete and their ability to drive our strategy forward. One of my first priorities when I became CEO was to develop a succession plan to ensure the consistency of our leadership and the execution of our long-term strategy. With many years of experience as our CFO, Peter is exceptional at navigating the public company landscape and has spent extra time with each of our regions to get a first-hand understanding of what it takes to support our leaders in the field. He has served as a close advisor to me and was essential in helping craft our current strategy. I'm working closely with him to ensure a thoughtful and seamless transition. Pete Beckmann is a brilliant financial leader and someone who is widely respected within the organization. I am grateful for our deep bench of talent and to lead BFS in such good hands. I want to wrap up by saying that I'm not going far away. I'll enjoy continuing to serve BFS as a member of our Board, and I am taking an active role to ensure a smooth transition in the near term. I'm excited to continue supporting our growth and success. Thank you, again. I'll now hand the call over to Peter."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Pete Beckmann",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the introduction, and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve as CFO. For background, I have spent the last 25 years at BFS and legacy companies in roles of increasing responsibility, including being an integral part of the ProBuild and BMC mergers. Most recently, I served as SVP of Financial Planning and Analysis, where we have partnered with all levels of the enterprise and was responsible for our financial forecasting, strategic capital and annual planning. I look forward to helping enable profitable growth while maintaining our track record of prudent financial management through the cycle and disciplined capital allocation. Despite continued housing market choppiness we delivered resilient results during the third quarter as we continue to execute our strategy and operating model. We are leveraging our fortress balance sheet and free cash flow generation to drive disciplined capital deployment, as witnessed by our share repurchases and acquisitions during the quarter. Our scale and financial flexibility enable us to act as key partners to homebuilders, and we have a clear line of sight to compound value creation over the long term. We are well positioned for meaningful operating leverage when the market turns. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our third quarter results; second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment; and finally, I'll discuss our 2024 guidance, 2025 scenarios and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on Slides 9 and 10. Net sales were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 6.7%, driven by a 7.2% decline in core organic sales as multifamily continues to trend downward, and 2.9% of commodity deflation. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 2% and one additional selling day that contributed 1.4%. The organic sales decrease was driven by a 31% decline in multifamily as we lap the prior year's strong comps and a 4.6% decline in single-family amid lower value per start. This was partially offset by a small increase in repair and remodel of almost 1%, given strength in the central region. As we have shared on recent calls, there have been three main variables reconciled single-family starts for organic sales. The first variable is the lag between permits and starts. This quarter, unlike last quarter, we have seen the impact of early permit polls stay where we continue to see a generally extended permit completion cycle time. As a rule of thumb, we expect a roughly two-month lag between the start and our first setting. Second, the value of the average home has fallen as size and complexity have decreased. Finally, we have seen slight normalization in selling margins of non-commodity products and manufacture price cuts in some products. Summarized, although there are sales dollars built for start today, we remain the market leader and will begin to deliver strong operating performance. Value-added products represented 49% of our net sales during the third quarter. As a rule of thumb, our multifamily sales are made up of roughly 70% value-added products. Gross profit was $1.4 billion, a decrease of approximately 12% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 32.8%, down 210 basis points, primarily driven by multifamily and core organic normalization. SG&A increased $19 million to $958 million, primarily attributable to acquired operations and asset write-offs, partially offset by lower variable compensation due to lower net sales. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 190 basis points to 22.6%. Adjusted SG&A decreased approximately $1 million to $783 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation due to lower net sales, partially offset by acquired operations. On an annual basis, adjusted SG&A is approximately 30% fixed and 70% variable with volumes. For reference, we have an adjusted SG&A reconciliation schedule in the earnings release. We are focused on carefully managing our SG&A expenses and are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $627 million, down 23%, primarily driven by lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.8%, down 310 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments. Adjusted net income of $360 million was down $174 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments and lower income tax expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.07, a decrease of 28% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.22 per share for the third quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 11. Q3 operating cash flow was $730 million, an increase of $81 million, mainly attributable to a decrease in net working capital. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $95 million, and free cash flow was approximately $635 million. For the last 12 months ended September 30th, our free cash flow yield was approximately 8% while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 25%. Our trailing 12 months net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4x, while base business leverage was 1.5x. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $2 billion, consistent of $1.7 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $300 million in cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment. During the third quarter, we repurchased roughly 900,000 shares for approximately $160 million at an average stock price of $176.73 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August 2021, we have repurchased 45.5% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $77.62 per share for $7.3 billion. We have approximately $840 million remaining on our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns. On Slide 12, we show our 2024 outlook. We anticipate a regional financial impact from Hurricane Helene and Milton, around $40 million in sales, a relatively modest amount given our geographic diversification. For full year 2024, we have narrowed our range of expected total company net sales to be $16.25 billion to $16.55 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.2%. We expect our 2024 full year gross margin guide to be in the range of 32% to 33%. This also remains in line with our long-term expectation of 30% to 33% and normalized single-family starts of $1 million to $1.1 million. We expect full year 2024 full year gross margin guide to be in the range of 32% to 33%. This also remains in line with our long-term expectation of 30% to 33% and normalized single-family starts of $1 million to $1.1 million. We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, assuming average commodity prices in the range of $380 to $400 per 1,000 board feet. 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for a list of these key assumptions. Moving to Slide 14. We recognize that 2025 is coming into focus as we approach year-end. Like we did last year, we have laid out a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions. I want to emphasize that this is not guidance, but these scenarios should help clarify our range of performance expectations for 2025 and demonstrate the strength of our best-in-class operating platform. Turning to slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and resiliency of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $15.4 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.3 billion at a margin of 14%, which reflects a minimal impact from commodities. For context, Slide 16 shows that our 2020 base business adjusted EBITDA was roughly $1.1 billion and 991,000 single-family starts, and we are expecting better adjusted EBITDA at lower single-family starts this year. On Slide 17, we provide a bridge from our 2019 gross margin to the long-term normalized midpoint of 31.5%. Our improved margin profile has a greater mix of value-added products, productivity savings and commercial benefits. As I wrap up, I am confident in our ability to execute our strategy and drive long-term growth by leveraging our exceptional platform and financial flexibility. The Investor Day goals we laid out last December remain achievable, assuming a return to normalized single-family starts of $1.1 million in 2026. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Peter for some final thoughts. Matt, thank you for the question. We're seeing a headwind as we exit 2024, of about another 100 basis points from the year-to-date average margin, 100 basis points, pretty consistent with what we said last quarter is half of it is made up from the multifamily normalization and the other half from the core business normalization. It is a competitive environment. We're going to continue to compete, especially on the commodity products with the install. Install has been a favorable result for us in 2024, and it continues to be a good arrow in the quiver, and we'll continue to compete every day and we expect to exit right around 31.5. Overall, we're certainly very pleased with the margin performance despite the challenging market, we've seen customers really continuing to benefit from the value-added products and services. That part of our business has certainly stayed strong, stay resilient, and it supported our margins in an environment where volumes are and values are down a little bit. Thanks, Matt. Morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. With respect to fee performance and margin, we continue to see a normalization in the multifamily space. We continue to have positive uplift from productivity that we continue to deliver. And the rest of it is mix and mix within the core business, and it continues to deliver resilient margins better than what we had expected originally when we gave guidance last quarter. As we look forward to Q4, we continue to see margin normalization in the multifamily, which is a broken record, and we continue to share that each quarter and some continued pressure and normalization in the core business due to the competitive environment that we're still in. And part of it is going to be some of the seasonal build, and we'll see some of that volume kind of shoulder off as we exit the year. Yes. So within the productivity savings, that's process improvements. The scale that we get from the company really helps us leverage our knowledge and our expertise across the platform. But the productivity savings is process improvement on how we do things and how well we're buying, how well we're manufacturing and how well we're operating on a daily basis. Within the other commercial benefits of saying that there's customer supplier terms. We've talked about in the past where we used to have longer fixed-price contracts. We've worked to eliminate those, shorten the duration. So we don't get pinched or absorbing all the commodity risk. Our CRM tools that we put in place and how well we're managing our relationships with our customers and falling through, and that's where some of the scale is going to come into play. So you'll see that in the bullets on the side of that chart. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Peter. What you're seeing in the manufacturing products, specifically on the multifamily side. We've been talking about the normalization, but also the volume declines that we've seen in that multifamily space. As a reminder, I mentioned in our prepared remarks that multifamily may value-added products was 70% of the multifamily overall. That used to be a much higher percent and that's also come down. And in the quarter or what we're seeing within multifamily, manufactured products is down almost 45% to 50% within that multifamily mix. We're anticipating that, that's going to continue to decline as what we're seeing from the starts and the volume normalize as we'd lap the higher year. The tough comps that we had last year was the peak, and Q3 being the highest point of that. It's just a big headwind, but we're seeing more stable volume and it's normalizing at a bottom as we exit the year. With the multifamily margin normalization, it's continuing to wane and fade. As we said on prior calls, we think it's going to kind of normalize out by Q1 of next year, but we're really hitting that exit rate. And most of the normalization you see in the results is a year-over-year comp to the prior year's strength that we had."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying that we are indebted to Dave for his decades of service at BFS as a leader, steward and champion of the company and our people. Dave has truly done it all, and his legacy of excellence will continue to inspire us as we move forward. I'm truly honored and grateful to be named the next CEO of Builders FirstSource. I'm humbled to represent our talented, hard-working team and the fantastic business that we have built. BFS has had tremendous success and become a world-class organization because of the commitment and contributions made by this team. Let's get started with Slide 3 and our strategic pillars, which remain unchanged. As we continue to execute our strategy, I believe there are three areas that we can emphasize so we can continue to outperform today and transform tomorrow. The first opportunity is with our people. I want us to advance the industry standard in this area so that we are recognized as a premier destination for talent. I believe we can enhance how we invest in, develop and support our team members from our frontline operators to our leadership. The second opportunity is to further build and catalyze our growth prospects, from our products to our processes. I see potential to improve our consistency capabilities and ways of working, so we can extend our lead and grow a bigger, better BFS of tomorrow. And the third opportunity is to improve how we collaborate and learn from each other within the company. We have a wealth of expertise, knowledge and innovative technologies. I believe we have a real opportunity to enhance how we work together. So that what we are discovering in Charlotte is shared with Phoenix and what we are developing in Florida can be scaled in Texas. Let's turn now to our third quarter highlights on Slide 4. I'm proud of our resilient performance, which reflects our execution and operational rigor, even as we continue to see soft sales, amid rate uncertainty and extreme weather. Despite these challenges, we delivered strong gross margins of nearly 33%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin has remained in the mid-teens or better for 14 consecutive quarters, which highlights our transformed business model and our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Let's move to Slide 5, where we touch on some of the specific ways we are executing our strategy. Our portfolio of value-added products and services remains a competitive advantage for BFS and continues to bolster our partnerships with customers. We've seen steady progress with digital, as we continue to hear great feedback from customers and see increasing levels of adoption each week. We demonstrated operational excellence by delivering $27 million in productivity savings in Q3 and have driven $104 million year-to-date, primarily through more efficient manufacturing and procurement initiatives. Installed services continues to be a great opportunity for us as we leverage playbooks from successful markets. I'm pleased that our install sales increased by 11% year-over-year, as we focus on helping customers address labor challenges. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending and are continuing to maximize operational flexibility. We have consolidated 11 facilities year-to-date, while maintaining our service levels to our customers with an on-time and in-full delivery rate of over 90%. Single-family softness continued in Q3, amid on-going affordability challenges and below normal starts. The initial reaction to the Fed's first interest rate cut in September has been mixed, with some homebuyers remaining on the sidelines and waiting for additional rate cuts as mortgage rates fluctuate in the near term. As a reminder, the value of a new start has fallen as the housing market has adapted to affordability challenges. Multifamily continues to be a headwind, amid muted activity is expected. Comparisons should get less negative as we lap record performance from last year. On a normalized basis, multifamily represents about 9% to 10% of net sales and is an attractive and profitable business for us. As we detailed on our Q2 call, our Q4 exit velocity indicates about a percentage point of margin erosion from '24 on a full year basis, roughly half of which is from multifamily. To address the current environment and affordability challenges, builders have employed specs, smaller and simpler homes and interest rate buydowns to help buyers find affordable options. Builders of all sizes are having to navigate this market in addition to regulatory, land development and infrastructure challenges. Smaller builders have been especially impacted by the availability of land and limited options to buy down rates. We are leaning in by partnering with our customers to help them lower the cost of homes for consumers as well as maintain their margins. This includes offering a balanced product mix that addresses builder needs while passing through lower material costs. For instance, we have continued to supply more engineered wood and have sold fewer floor trusses to help alleviate affordability challenges. We have also supplied more lower-cost offerings in products like windows and doors to help reduce costs. Although these actions in support of our customers need less sales and gross profit dollars, our margin profile remains strong, and we are well positioned for growth as starts to increase and structural headwinds begin to subside. Turning to M&A on Slide 6, we continue to pursue attractive opportunities, while remaining financially disciplined. Over the years, we have developed a substantial and proven muscle memory to grow through M&A and have an impressive track record of successfully integrating these transactions. In the third quarter, we completed six deals with an aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $190 million. In July, we acquired Western Truss & Components, having trust capacity in the Flagstaff, Arizona area and CRi SoCal, a dealer and installer of high-end windows and doors in Orange County, California. In August, we acquired Wyoming Millwork, the leading independent building products distributor in Delaware. September, we acquired Sunrise Wood Designs, a top custom cabinet manufacturer and installer in North Texas. And in the Reno area, Reno Trust, a leading trust manufacturer to the single and multifamily markets and High Mountain Door & Trim, a distributor and installer of windows doors and in Millwork. Additionally, in October, we acquired Douglas Lumber, which provides a range of building materials to contractors, remodelers and homeowners in the Rhode Island area. These acquisitions reinforce our commitment to growing value-added products. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. On Slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. In addition to the six tuck-in acquisitions during the third quarter, we executed share repurchases of roughly $160 million. It's driven by our track record, we'll continue to allocate capital to high-return opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We deployed approximately $1.7 billion through the first three quarters of this year and remain on track strategically to $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026 and we outlined at Investor Day last December. Now let's turn to Slide 8, and discuss the latest updates on our digital strategy. With our BFS digital tools, we are focused on creating value for our homebuilder customers and in doing so, further extending our industry leadership position and driving substantial organic growth. We have seen strong adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller builders despite the challenging market. We have had broad acceptance of the platform so far, including interest from multiple top 200 builders. Since launching in late February, we have seen nearly $600 million of orders placed through our digital platform, of which $83 million were incremental sales from existing and new customers. While we're very pleased with the incremental sales to date, given market headwinds from our targeted segment of builders, we now expect total incremental sales of approximately $110 million in 2024 versus our initial goal of $200 million. Despite the slow start, we remain confident in our ability to meet our target of $1 billion in incremental sales in 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers. Before I turn the call over, I want to say that we are very fortunate to have Pete Beckmann step into the role of CFO. He has a long proven track record as a finance leader which I've witnessed first-hand. I look forward to partnering with him to deliver exceptional results and compound shareholder value. Pete, take it away. Thanks, Pete. Let me close by reiterating that we continue to execute. Our resilient business model allows us to win in any environment, and this is evidenced by our strong gross profit margins and cash flow generation in the third quarter. I'm confident in the long-term strength of our industry due to the significant housing underbuilt and favorable demographic trends. We are well positioned to take advantage of these tailwinds, which will help drive growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We are a key partner to our customers and continue to deepen our value proposition by helping them solve problems through our investments in value-added products, digital tools and install services. Our proven playbook for growth, fortress balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Even in an uncertain and challenging environment, we are doing the hard work now and building for the future. By continuing to grow in value add and install along with leveraging IT and technological development, we are arming our team members with cutting-edge tools to continue to be the supplier of choice for our customers. By investing today, we are exceptionally well positioned to win in the future as the market continues to recover. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, please open the call now for questions. As a reminder, with a lot of questions this morning, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thanks, Matt. Yes, there's a lot in that question. So, a couple of factors. I would say where we are today, we have certainly seen the choppiness in the market. There wasn't a big relief rally when interest rates were cut, mortgage rates didn't necessarily behave as everyone was hoping in terms of a quick fall. And I think buyers have been appropriately or inappropriately nervous about both rates and the election. So, it's been a little choppy. I think we've seen that. We've been watching it all year. Still performing well. I think the business is still competing well, taking advantage of opportunities, we're investing. Those things have led to, I think, some solid performance on our part, but we have certainly faced headwinds. We've been hopefully pretty open about that. The value of these homes has fallen. That's really the biggest disconnect. when we look at what starts have done and what our sales have done, particularly in that single-family core organic category. That doesn't mean we're not happy and competitive. But certainly, it's been challenging out there, and we've talked about that. As we think about what that means into the fourth quarter and into next year, I think, broadly speaking, it's mixed out there. You've got markets that are doing quite well. They're sort of bouncing up and seeing some green shoots starting to perform. We've got other markets that have struggled and seen headwinds and seen a little bit of excess inventory and builders are reacting in a thoughtful way, we believe, to managing that. So, our guide for the fourth quarter is certainly focused on the visibility that we have into the market, the conversations we're having with customers, it's not a bad market by any stretch, but it's one that has certainly seen some challenges, not at all helped by the weather disruptions that we've seen. As we get into '25, it's early days. We've been looking at the commentary from the economists. We've been talking with our customers. It's a bit of a mixed bag, some doing better than others. We think there will be a bit of a differentiated reaction as rates are cut. We expect there will likely be at least a couple of more. We think mortgage rates will continue to settle that will have different advantages to different builders out in the market. So, this is what we're seeing today. There's certainly new news, some of the performance announcements over the past few weeks have saved our opinions as we go forward. But we thought like last year, this is a helpful starting point for helping people understand what we're thinking based on what we see today. Thank you, Charles. Appreciate the comments and the questions. So, I would say the numbers and the performance of the business around margins in particular, there's a lot going on there, right? With the early look at what we have on the table, I think what it reveals is continuing performance in the areas that you'd expect us to deliver. We expect to see improved performance as a result of productivity initiatives. We continue to see the strength around the value-add. We continue to look for opportunities within that productivity category to drive both gross margins and EBITDA margins. That is, I would say, a core part of our operating model as a business and something you feel good about as time progresses. The dynamics around how the market will perform next year in light of the sales volumes in the various categories. I think broadly speaking, we continue to see weakness in multifamily. I would say our sense of it is it's stabilized, but it's been a big step down from the peak, but gotten to a level where we believe we can hold here and hopefully, start to see some recovery timing will depend on the dynamics of the market. Single family is a dynamic that's different between the types of builders, as I mentioned earlier, but certainly 1 that we think is directionally headed in a positive way. We continue to believe in the strength of the market, the desirability of new homes and the industry's ability to deliver those. We think there's a lot of pent-up demand and we are well positioned to help builders deliver and do it in a very efficient way. This -- again, early days on this guide, but for '25, but we think those scenarios can help add some color in that regard. Yes. So commodities continue to be an important part of what we do, although we are much smaller than it has in the past. It's nice to see the prices bouncing off the bottom. I'd say that below 400 window that we were in for a while was a bit, I would say, unpleasant more so for the mills and the delivery on the commodity side than for us. But certainly, we like to have a healthy sector in the commodity space and that lumber -- the dimensional lumber in OSB space in particular. We have seen a little bit of a boost I think it's early days. And I would highlight the fact that while new construction is an important driver of demand in that product category, R&R, the Repair and Remodel market is a far bigger influence. So, I think that's where, if I'm looking for support and tailwind in that category, that's an important factor to keep an eye on. You hit the nail in the head, it will certainly be a tailwind for sales and for margins as we see better absorption of our overhead costs. If that continues to increase in costs. Although, as always, we keep a close eye on affordability. We want to balance there. We not think any of us want to return to the $1,300 to $1,600 lumber days. That was pretty dysfunctional. So, a modest increase is, I think, healthy and good to stabilize the market. Thank you. Yes. I think Pete's right on in terms of the key drivers. We continue to be under a bit of pressure on the competitive dynamic. You'll see some seasonality but I think, in general, what you're seeing is the continued strength of the core product offerings and the value add in terms of something that we have made a core part of what we do and has continued to be strong. Sure. I can provide a little bit of color. I won't go into too much detail, but you're right. There's a lot that goes into it. No question. I would say the starting point is maybe where we're most maybe disconnected based on your comments and your concern about the overall starts we, at this stage of the game aren't folding in a lot of commentary, we're folding in mainly the economist forecasts and the averages of the leading forecasters around the start numbers. While an individual builder is certainly important and an important partner for us. There's no one builder that's going to move the entire market. So we generally will stay at the economist level forecasting for starts, especially at the point we're at in early November. We do have assumptions in there for commodity prices, for the M&A carryover for productivity. We've got certainly an expectation that we'll be able to gain share with some of the initiatives we've leaned hard into things like digital and install. And I think it's fair to say that our thinking around the average cost per start is aligning around it flattening out for the most part. We haven't seen continued decline. It's been more stable. I would say, since mid-summer on a year-over-year basis, we've certainly seen the comparisons, and we've tried to call those out, but it hasn't been something that's aggressively moved down after the reset earlier this year. So that's another variable that's included. But like I said, early days some high-level analytics, we tried to be inclusive of the variables that we think are important. But as you know, this is a challenging game given how volatile things are lately. Dave, thank you. I'm going to let Pete handle that one. That's right. Yes. There are a bunch of pieces in there, certainly square footage of the home being one, but mix of products in the home value of those same products that are appearing in the home, all part of that. But yes, we're expecting it to flatten out based on what we're seeing right now. Little bit of a lapping impact but pretty modest. Thank you. Yes. And I think just broadly speaking, the multifamily trust has been hardest hit. The multifamily work part of the business has performed a bit better, been a bit more stable. The team has competed well and found other opportunities to protect the business. I think that the side, the single-family side has certainly seen pressure, particularly in that category that we highlighted in the spoken remarks about floor trusses and the shift back to EWP. I think that's probably the only other color that I would add there. In general, we're still pleased with manufactured products in general. I think it's performing well from a support to customer perspective, from an affordability perspective, from a competitive dynamic, we feel good about and it's a productivity source for us. But it certainly on a comp basis has been challenging. There's a lot in there, right? I mean we've done a ton of acquisitions. We've added a ton of capacity. We've made tremendous investment. A lot of that had to do with productivity savings within the category itself that sort of generated through the size and scale of those operations. So there's certainly a lot in there. The performance generally speaking, I would say, is sustainable from the perspective that we have a lot more to offer. We have a wider portfolio and geography coverage than we did in the past. So I think that's the exciting part about where we can continue to grow this business into the future. That expansion of install, the investments we've made in that business over the years being harvested as we return to growth. I think that's an exciting history for us, but even more exciting is what the future holds in that category. Thank you, Philip, for your four questions. Let me try and jump at a couple of them and you can correct me in point me back in the direction you want me to go. We -- what I would say about the 2025 scenarios, we didn't do a downside. We could do a downside. I think generally speaking, like I said, the economists aren't signalling a downside. So it if that develops over time where we need to put something out there, we certainly can. We've done it in the past. We're not going to be shy about it. That hasn't been the predominant thinking in the recent past. I think that the ability of this business to perform in the downside is pretty positive. We have demonstrated the ability to size ourselves to be competitive to get after it, ability to protect and hold margins to do it by partnering with customers with products that they want. So I think that's probably the theme that I want to go with. You point me in a couple of other points you want me to highlight. So we don't have an explicit mortgage rate assumption in any of our stuff. I think what happens is it's basically embedded or implicit in what the economists are doing. My sense is most of them are taking the middle of the road dot plot and trying to step off of that, but we don't have an explicit assumption for it. In terms of pricing, I will say our sense from what we've seen from some vendors is that the era of cuts is ended. What we're seeing right now is stability in pricing in some modest, maybe low single-digit price increases. We'll see where that pans out. It's a little early to be calling that yet, but that's the tone right now. Well, yes, I mean, there's no question the market is looking strong. I mean with six this quarter, I'd say the pipeline is strong. Smaller deals, by and large it make up this number, no question, but there are a number of really nice looking businesses out there. I would say that sellers have come to the market with an intent to sell. They're not exploring. They're looking to move, but a pretty wide portfolio of items that we're looking at and continue to look at it. It's a good time to be buying stuff. Thanks, Jay. Talking about 17, that's the long range view. So one of the things we had done during Investor Day was to give people a rough estimate around what we think normalized gross margins were going to be between 30% and 33%. A frequent question that we received was wait a minute, help me get my head around this. What are the big pieces that I should understand if I bridge you from pre-BMC merger to what you're telling me is the future of this business. And we were a little hesitant to lay that out there until we have a little better understanding of what normalization was going to look like. And as things have kind of calmed down and we feel like there's a clearer line of sight to what this business is and how it will continue to perform. We decided to put this out for everybody to understand the buckets of what has driven it, where we have gotten our sort of inputs to defend that midpoint of 30% to 33%, which is about 31.5%. So this isn't a Q4 or a '25 thing. This correlates back to the 2026 target for us for Investor Day. Yes. I mean -- if you look at the overall, I want to -- just to clarify based on what we've seen from a couple of different sources, R&R is probably in DIY is about half of the demand for lumber and sort of the commodity product. We're closer to quarter or third with the rest of it being industrial and commercial. So certainly, that DIY R&R space is more important the tone has been pretty good. I think the sense is that there is a lot of pent-up demand for renovations as the housing stock in this country ages. There are certain commentators will, for example, who's pretty -- I won't say excited, but positive about what R&R can do if we start to see a little bit of pullback in the mortgage rates and it starts to release a little bit of that lock-in effect that people have experienced since mortgage rates went up. So that would certainly be a tailwind a balancing out in the market, I think a revival of what that represents for demand on the construction industry. I think all of that is pretty favorable for Builders FirstSource on balance. So that's certainly a positive we look forward to. Pretty modest and from what we see so far in the forecast for '25 itself, but over sort of '25, '26-ish we think there's good momentum there. Thanks Jay. Thanks. Yes. Productivity is something this organization is really engaged in very effectively sharing of best practices, working together on feed ideas, ways of doing business that just takes out waste and inefficiencies at a real fundamental level has been super successful. We think there's more opportunity for that, but I won't overstate the impact of the transition that we'll see over the next couple of years towards our ERP conversion. So there has to be a balance there, both take a lot of time and energy from the organization. So we'll continue to balance it out from a timing perspective. But there's zero question, I would say, in my mind and in the minds of the operating leaders that we can continue to get better, that we can continue to drive productivity savings well into the future. I think we're just in the early innings of what we can do with just a fantastic business and a wonderful platform, particularly as we take advantage of technology and better tools for our teams. Well, we're certainly seeing it everywhere. I would say every homebuilder in their own way is trying to adapt to the affordability challenges. It's tough for home buyers just given the world that we live in to afford these new prices. And so we're all looking for ways to do what we do more efficiently. So whether it's size of the home, whether it's value of the products that are going in being a little more sharper with the pencil in terms of pricing or -- and this is, I think, more direct to your comment what's the mix of products that are going to show up in the actual, the home itself. I think you've seen even today announcements from manufacturers of building materials that have pointed to negative mix people have moved to the simpler, cheaper option in order to make sure the price point for these homes match up to the monthly payment capability of the current homebuilder. I think it has been a bit of a two years step down. We're not seeing the continued pace of those declines. They seem to have stabilized to a large degree. That's not to say we won't see some shifts in individual product categories. But I think what we have seen throughout the back half of this year so far, has been a more stable output in terms of what is going into homes, size of the homes, value of the products, that sort of thing. So maybe second question first. Certainly, a smaller component of the R&R business. That is more varied from a product perspective, a lot more categories go through that. Just given the nature of what we sell and where we sell it. Certainly, a bit of variance between the individual divisions between those markets. I would say we've had some pretty nice success in some of our smaller markets, particularly in the North Central around the R&R space. They performed well. But in general, I think it's a strength for us just as we continue to have available capacity and open our doors to the smaller remodeler. We have a lot of value that we can provide them with subject matter expertise and product knowledge. And generally, we do have success in that category when we focus on it. But just to repeat it, it's a fairly small percentage of our overall business. Thank you, Steven. It's primarily lapping. Yes. It's -- I would say we stabilized, but the lapping effect will still be there. I'd say overall, we're in late innings. We're much closer to the end in terms of the margin normalization. We certainly have teed up that 100 basis point sort of based on the exit velocity that we're seeing I don't want to miss the opportunity to highlight we're still well below normal starts. So that certainly creates pressure. But based on where we came from, we believe we're much closer than the beginning. So the 11% is a year-to-date improvement over the prior year. The margin profile on install is kind of at our normal mix across because we're installing products Windows, Doors, Millwork, as well as some framing and trusses and siting and other products. So it's very complementary to the overall margins that we have across all the product categories. Size of install, I think you want to know. So install was about -- I think it was 2.5 billion, 2.6 billion last year. It's increased. So it's going to be a relative increase from that. Yes, I'm glad you asked that question. So digital is -- it's still very exciting. The product works -- it is absolutely cutting edge and unique in the industry in terms of what we can do versus any competition that exists out there. But it's new, right? It's technology in an industry that hasn't historically adopted it quickly. And it's a different way of thinking about how to be more efficient. We've got a lot of really good momentum it's certainly hard. I will confess, it's maybe even harder than we gave it credit for, but it's worked. And so we're continuing to lean in, continuing to partner with homebuilders continuing to leverage our team internally to utilize the tools and to help customers get comfortable with the tools. But given our focus on the sort of 50 to 250 starts a year builder, and how much pressure they've been under over the past couple of years because of rates, it's been challenging. I do believe this is one way they can compete, that they can be more efficient that they can be more professionalized and make their business better and more competitive against the big guys. So we think, ultimately, it will be a positive. But certainly, in the near term, it's serving a market that's been under pressure. No question."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Rush: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. As we continue to operate in a complex environment, I'm proud of our resilient second quarter results, highlighted by our mid-teens EBITDA margin, which demonstrates the strength of our differentiated business model, and the hard work of our extraordinary team members. While we continue to see the expected affordability challenges and normalization in multi-family, we are executing our strategy by controlling what we can control, investing in value-added solutions, and driving adoption of our industry-leading digital platform, our ability to solve industry pain points with our best-in-class product portfolio and exceptional customer service makes us a trusted partner as our customers navigate this complex macro landscape. While near-term market dynamics are challenging as starts have lost momentum, we remain focused on executing our strategy in the weeks and months ahead, and we are well-positioned for growth as long-term housing tailwinds remain intact. Moving to our strategic pillars, on slide three, we continue to invest in value-added products, installed services, and digital solutions [technical difficulty] -- we are providing our customers with a more efficient and cost-effective way to manage home construction. This leads to increased customer stickiness, new business, and improved operational efficiency for BFS. We have a robust set of continuous improvement initiatives focused on leveraging our scale while delivering the highest quality products and services to our customers. Our highly experienced team members are delivering these critical initiatives while serving our customers with excellence and integrity every day. Finally, we continue to allocate capital in a disciplined manner with a proven M&A strategy and a track record of buying back shares at attractive prices over the long-term. Turning to our second quarter highlights on slide four, while navigating a market challenged by crosscurrents, we have seen softer than expected sales. However, we delivered strong gross margins of nearly 33% in Q2, and our adjusted EBITDA margin has remained in the mid-teens or better for 13 consecutive quarters. Our durable margin profile is a key proof point of our transformed business model and our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Given the strength of our base gross margin, we see opportunities to more aggressively go after profitable share. We have grown our mix of value-added products over the past five years, improved our manufacturing processes and efficiency, and positioned ourselves at the forefront of homebuilding innovation. Let's move to slide five where we show how we're executing our strategy. Our full suite of value-added products and services remains a competitive advantage for BFS, and continues to bolster our partnerships with customers. We're pleased with our progress on digital as we continue to hear great feedback from customers and see increasing levels of adoption each week. We demonstrated operational rigor by delivering $37 million in productivity savings in Q2, and had driven $77 million year-to-date primarily through more efficient manufacturing and procurement initiatives. As I've spoken about in the past, we continue to use playbooks to drive growth in our Installed Services business. I'm pleased that our installed sales increased by 15% year-over-year as we focus on helping customers address labor challenges. Our managers have best-in-class information to help them navigate this dynamic environment and make effective real-time decisions. We are also maximizing operational flexibility, and have consolidated seven facilities, while maintaining our service levels to our customers with on-time and in-full delivery rate of over 90%. We will remain disciplined managers of discretionary spending no matter the operating environment. We are continuing to take actions into the second-half of the year to flex the business where appropriate. The single-family growth momentum, occurring earlier in 2024, has stalled as the interest rate cuts have not materialized and starts have come in lower than expected. In addition, the value of a new start has fallen as the market has adapted to affordability challenges. Multi-family continues to be a headwind amid muted activity and relative to our record performance last year, which is creating an increasingly tough comparison. This was expected and detailed on prior [calls] (ph) as multi-family continues to normalize. Even at today's levels, multi-family continues to be a very profitable business for us. In the current environment, builders have employed specs, smaller and simpler homes, and interest rate buy-downs to help buyers find affordable options. Builders of all sizes are having to navigate affordability issues along with regulatory, land development and infrastructure challenges. Smaller builders have been especially impacted by the availability of land and limited options to buy down rates. We are partnering with our customers to help them lower the cost of homes for consumers, as well as maintain their margins. This includes balancing our product mix to address their needs while passing through lower material costs. For example, when engineered wood products or EWP was constrained, we supplied a larger number of higher-value floor trusses. As EWP supply normalized and prices came down, we have been able to provide customers with more EWP, and have sold fewer floor trusses, helping to specifically address the builders' biggest challenge, affordability. We have what the builders want and do what's right by them. Although this trend means less sales in gross profit dollars, our margin profile remains strong. We have the operational and financial flexibility needed to partner with our customers to meet their needs and capture growth opportunities. Coming to M&A, on slide six, we continue to pursue attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In the second quarter, we completed three deals with aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $72 million. In May, we acquired Schoeneman's Building Materials, which we detailed on our Q1 call, and TRS Components which establishes truss manufacturing within Metro Detroit. In June, we acquired RPM Wood Products, which enhances our ability to serve high-end custom builders in Northeast Florida. Finally, in July, we acquired Western Truss & Components, adding truss capacity in Flagstaff, Arizona area, and CRi SoCal, a dealer and installer of high-end windows and doors in Orange County. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. Our disciplined approach to M&A includes increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions, and enhancing customer retention. Our M&A pipeline remains healthy, and we believe we can continue to acquire in a fragmented market. On slide seven, we provide an update on capital allocation. In addition to the three tuck-in acquisitions during the second quarter, we repurchased nearly $1 billion of shares. I'm happy to announce that our Board has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase plan. As proven by our track record, we'll continue to buy back shares while allocating capital to high-return opportunities. We remain on track to strategically deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026, as outlined at Investor Day, last December. Now, let's turn to slide eight and nine for an update on our digital strategy. As the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space, we believe BFS digital tools will be transformative for the industry and a substantial driver of organic growth. We have seen strong adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller builders even as they endure a challenging operating backdrop. We've had broad acceptance of the platform so far, including interest from multiple top 200 builders. Since launching in late February, we have seen the value of orders placed through the digital platform go from nearly 0 to over $250 million. Year-to-date through Q2, incremental sales have totaled $45 million. While we still have a long way to go, we remain confident in our ability to meet our target of $1 billion in incremental sales by 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers. I am thrilled to share a significant achievement that underscores our team members' commitment to making a positive impact in our communities. At our recent annual charity event, we successfully raised over $1 million on behalf of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. This brings total contributions to nearly $12 million since first partnering with LLS in 2006. These funds are crucial to advance in research, patient support, and advocacy programs aimed at finding treatments and cures for blood cancers. I want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our industry partners and sponsors whose overwhelming support made this successful event impossible. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We were able to effectively navigate a softer than expected housing environment during the second quarter by leaning into the pillars of our strategy and operating model. Leveraging our fortress balance sheet and exceptional financial flexibility, we executed nearly $1 billion of share repurchases into stock price weakness. And, made three tuck-in acquisitions to enhance and expand our footprint. We believe the sustainable competitive advantages and our extensive geographic coverage, value-added solutions, and strong financial position are enabling us to successfully manage market dynamics and deliver long-term value creation. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our second quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our revised 2024 guidance and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our second quarter performance on slides 10 and 11. Net sales were $4.5 billion. A decrease of 1.6% as core organic sales declined 3.8% with the expected multi-family downward trend. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 1.9% and commodity inflation of 0.3%. The core organic sales decline was driven by a multi-family decline of 31%. Partially offset by increases in single-family of 1% amid higher starts and repair & remodel of 1.5%. I want to take a moment to discuss the variables impacting the disconnect between single-family start and core organic sales. As a reminder, historically there is a roughly two-month lag between a start and our first sale. In the current environment, we are seeing that lag extend as the relative timing of permit starts and completions has shifted in response to the changing market. Second, we have seen a meaningful decline in the sales opportunity of a start in 2024 as the size, complexity, and value of the average home has fallen. These changes are logical given the affordability challenges in the market. But, it means that we are seeing less dollars per start despite our strong operating performance. As an example, looking at the Phoenix market we are supplying material to roughly 45% more homes. But, our dollar sales are only about 15%. To summarize, despite a market where starts are smaller, less complex, and cheaper, we remain the market leader and will continue to deliver superior results. During the second quarter as we signaled and expected, multi-family declined more than 31% as we lacked the prior-year's strong comps. R&R and Other improved by over 1% given our retail strength in the faster growing West. Value-added products still represented approximately 49% of our net sales during the second quarter, despite the headwinds from multi-family. Gross profit was $1.5 billion. A decrease of approximately 8% compared to the prior-year period. Gross margins were 32.8%, decreasing 240 basis points, primarily driven by ongoing normalization, particularly in multi-family. SG&A decreased $45 million to $973 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation, partially offset by acquired operations. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased 70 basis points to 21.8%. The team has done an excellent job of managing SG&A, and we are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $670 million, down approximately 13%, primarily driven by lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15% down 200 basis points from the prior year. On a sequential basis, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 110 basis points, primarily driven by operating leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. Adjusted net income of $420 million was down $78 million from the prior year primarily due to lower gross profit partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.50, a decrease of 10% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.22 per share for the second quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow balance sheet and liquidity on slide 12. Our Q2 operating cash flow was approximately $452 million, an increase of $61 million, mainly attributable to a decrease in net working capital and more than offsetting almost a $100 million decline in adjusted EBITDA. This is a proof point of how our business generates a robust amount of cash in any environment. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $85 million, and free cash flow was approximately $367 million. For the last 12 months ended June 30th, our free cash flow yield was approximately 10%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 24%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.4 times, while base business leverage was 1.7 times. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of $1.6 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility, and approximately $100 million in cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the second quarter, we repurchased roughly 5.8 million shares for approximately $990 million at an average stock price of $170.01 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August of 2021, we have repurchased 45% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $76.65 per share for $7.1 billion. As Dave mentioned, the board approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns. Now let's turn to our outlook on slide 13, which we are lowering, given a softer than anticipated housing market and weaker commodities. For full-year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $16.4 billion to $17.2 billion versus our previous range of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion versus the previous range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 13.4% to 14% versus the previous range of 14% to 15%. And we are updating our 2024 full-year gross margin guidance to the range of 31.5% to 32.5% from 30% to 33%. This also remains in line with our long-term expectations of 30% to 33% at normalized single-family starts of 1 million to 1.1 million. Our long-term margin profile reflects a greater mix of value-added products, recent acquisition and disciplined pricing management. We expect full-year 2024 pre-cash low of $1 to $1.2, assuming an average commodity price in the range of $380 to $400 per thousand board feet. Our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions. While we do not typically give quarterly guidance, we wanted to provide color for Q3, given ongoing housing uncertainty and multi-family normalization. We expect Q3 net sales to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $575 million and $625 million in Q3. Turning to slides 15 and 16, as a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and resiliency of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business, where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $16.8 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.3 billion at a margin of 13.7%, which reflects a roughly net zero impact from commodities. For context, slide 16 shows that our 2020 base business adjusted EBITDA was roughly $1.1 billion at 991,000 single-family starts. And we're expecting better adjusted EBITDA at lower single-family starts this year. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that our exceptional positioning and financial flexibility gives us the confidence in our ability to execute our strategy and drive long-term growth. The Investor Day goals we laid out in December remain achievable, assuming a return to normalized single-family starts of $1.1 million in 2026. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.\nDave Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by reiterating that we continue to execute as evidenced by our strong profit margins and cash flow generation. Our resilient business model allows us to win in any environment. In 2020, we had an 8.7% base business adjusted EBITDA margin at 991,000 single-family starts. This year, we expect the mid-teens adjusted EBITDA margin at a lower level of housing starts. This demonstrates the resiliency of our transformed business and is a strong base to build from as the housing market grows to meet demand. I am confident in the long-term strength of the industry due to the significant housing underbill and favorable demographic trends. We are well positioned to take advantage of those tailwinds, which will help drive growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We believe we are the unquestioned leader in addressing our customers' pain points through our investments in value-added products, digital tools, and installed services. Our proven playbook for growth and robust free cash flow generation will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe we will start on the gross margin side, looking at the new margin guide and the cadence that you are implying for the second-half, I am curious as we zoom into the fourth quarter, what that would imply for the exit rate around gross margins? And certainly what I'm getting at is, as we think about 2025, where your starting point on gross margins would be as you continue to highlight that the overall 30 to 33 guide, the long-term guide is kind of at normalized housing starts, and certainly it begs the question, if we're not quite at normalized housing starts yet in 2025, where the gross margin could land if there's an air pocket, given the starts outlook? Thanks, guys.\nPeter Jackson: Morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. Yes, so margins has been an important factor for us. It's changed a lot over the years. We certainly get a lot of questions on it. We're pleased with how margins have performed so far, right? We knew normalization was going to happen. We saw it coming particularly on the multi-family side, but we're certainly pleased with how it's progressed. If you look into the future, into the second-half of this year and into next year, more normalization is what we've outlined. And I think that we've been pretty clear about that. Hopefully no change in what expectations are. When it comes to '25 and the exit rate, so I want to be real clear, right, we don't have a crystal ball, we don't know. This is not intended to be guide for '25. We haven't done that work yet. But based on what we're seeing right now, we're coming out of this year at roughly 975 on starts, give or take. Based on that, we're kind of at that level of performance that we're guiding to, right in that 32% range. As you think about 2025 based on what we're seeing right now, we think it's probably another 100 basis points at this level, like if you just extend the line out you'd see another 100 basis points of headwind into 2025 made up of the two pieces you'd expect, right? About half of that is multi-family, and about half of that is core operations based on what we're seeing. So, we're definitely closer to the end than the beginning in terms of the normalization based on what we see. The multi-family is a story, no question. We think that if you look back to last year, we called out a little over 100 basis points of tailwind from multi-family. We'll give back 60, maybe a little -- right in that range basis points in '24, with the other 50 basis points coming in '25. That's probably about a couple hundred million dollars worth of EBITDA headwind from multi-family. And we feel like the rest of the business is performing really well, and we'll be in a strong position to overcome that as we get into '25.\nDave Rush: Matt, the only thing I'd add is our focus and continuing focus on doing more for the customer with installed, doing more for the customer with value-add, those are higher margin profile products that we held, all said, any start variation.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay, that's very helpful quantification and color. And that dovetails into my next question. So, if I look at the total EBITDA guide for the year, I guess it's down about $300 million at the midpoint. But the base business EBITDA guide is only down by $100 million. So, I guess, presumably, the change in commodity prices is actually the largest change in the guide. I just want to clarify if that's the case. And if so, when we're talking about the kind of stability on the value-add side, can you speak to what has specifically changed in just the value-add outlook in terms of the growth side, starts, and specifically value-add margins, just what's really driven that piece of the guidance change there? Thank you.\nPeter Jackson: All right, so one question in 26 parts; let's see if I get them all.\nMatthew Bouley: Of course.\nPeter Jackson: So, overall, you're right, we have seen a shift in commodities, right? So the market's been weaker, the -- both lumber and OSB, OSB kind of ran up for a little bit, had absolutely reset and pulled back. That is largest component of the dollar value change in sales that we've called out. So, of the $1.2 billion, more than half of that is just the commodity valuation change. What that means to the business in terms of the rest of the output called down on EBITDA, the bulk of EBITDA call-down is deleveraging, it's the vast majority of it, right? It's the smaller business absorbs less of the fixed overhead costs. You can see this quarter; we had some pretty substantial improvement just because we are busiest in the summer months. We thought we'd be busier in the back-half than we're going to be, so we're giving some of that back. Value-add, more specifically, we continue to see strength. We continue to see the volumes moving very well, the demand is very strong; customers have consistently stayed with the product. We haven't seen a shift away from value-add broadly. What we are seeing and what we pointed out here -- what Dave pointed out in his remarks was really this mix dynamic, right? It goes to the customers focusing on affordability, how do they get cost out? One of the ways they're doing that is a shift within value-add, shifting from open-web truss to EWP, that's just -- it's a lower sales dollar value product, right? It's combined with a lot of other things. They're shrinking the square footage of the house, they're taking out basements, they're reducing the number of garages and bonus rooms. All things that are not a surprise, if you think about the affordability challenge. But that has had a broad pressure, that's not unique to value-add or not value-add. I think where value-add has seen pressure is really around the price pass-through in that type of mix. Volumes are still strong. Margins are still strong on the core product categories.\nDave Rush: One thing I would add on the value-add components specifically, Matt, is even as truss volumes declined our ability to more efficiently manufacture increases. As we go from two shifts to one shift, our second shift is the least profitable, for obvious reasons, but you put up with that because you leverage 100% of the fixed costs. When we go to one shift, that's our most profitable shift, so even as the top line may be less because of the demand being less, the ability to maintain margins is actually easier because we're most efficient in that one shift.\nMatthew Bouley: Great. Well, appreciate the color. Thanks, Dave, Peter. Good luck, guys.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Hi, and thanks for taking my questions. Probably going to just follow-up on a couple things there, look, Peter, I know that it's not a practice of yours to give pinpoint estimate on margins or certainly not to give formal guidance a year out at this point in the year. But I just want to be crystal clear on your last comment about exit rate in '25 gross margin just because there's been so much handwriting over this. When you're talking about -- it seems like you're saying, \"Hey, if my midpoint is 32% for this year, maybe my midpoint or my starting point in '25 is 31%.\" Or said another way, maybe my exit rate in 4Q of '24 is around 31% gross margin. Was that the intended message or could you clarify that a little bit more specifically on the 4Q gross margin here?\nPeter Jackson: Morning, Mike. In short, yes, you got it right. You heard it right. We think we're around 32% this year. We think our exit rate is around 31% based on everything we're seeing today. This is not guide. It's not intended to be a crystal ball; it's just trying to give directionality. The short answer to that, and I think you've alluded to it, and so did Matt, our long-range normalized margins we're seeing are 30% to 33% at 1.1 million starts. This would indicate that we're going to be at 31% at 975,000 starts. What does that mean? Well, that means, right now, margins are strong. Ours are good. Ours are better than we expected, which is great. But it also means we're under pressure in a market that's got extra capacity versus what we're all dialed in for, which is 1.1 million-plus, right? So, that's the tug of war going on right now, and why we're not able to put our stake in the ground and claim it. We've got to see how this plays out. Pretty optimistic, like Dave said, about the overall market, the demos, the under build, it's good. That we think tone is playing out maybe belatedly but positively in terms of the interest rate environment right now. So, we'll see. But it's a strong business. It's really well-positioned, and margins look good.\nMike Dahl: Okay, yes, that's helpful. And look, I agree and appreciate the zooming out and the perspective about the, hey, even if we're talking about 31%, it's 31% at these depressed levels of volume, which is longer-term actually quite constructive. Just shifting gears, all this stuff around the mix, the complexity, I -- this is, I think, another part that's hard for all of us and investors to appreciate when we're building out a model that tends to be volume focused. And so, I guess when you're -- all the moving pieces there, is there a way for you to articulate, hey, it's all equal, what we're seeing on the mix changes and complexity changes to date or to hold, here's how much of a delta we think it would drive relative to, if I think my single-family starts are low single, is that a -- is it a low single-digit headwind against that? Is it a mid-single digit headwind against that, any, any help you could provide on just kind of ballparking that and would be great?\nPeter Jackson: Yes, so that's -- it's a great question. We spent a lot of time on this. As we spend a lot of energy, we're trying to understand our business at a granular level. We have a lot of data. Unfortunately, it's a lot of data, right? So, the ability to really understand the mix impact of hundreds of thousands of SKUs at 570 locations in 80 markets, it's sometimes an adventure to really get through the noise to get the signal. I think earlier this year, you saw us reacting to what we were seeing, trying to understand it. I think the storyline around this whole value conversation is that the order of magnitude is bigger than we expected. I think the storyline around the timing of starts versus permits is again, order of magnitude, a little bigger than we expected. So, Q2, if you use our roughly two month lag, we've got about a 20 point gap that we're tracking down that we're saying, why aren't we up a lot more? And it's broken down into a few pieces, right? Probably the single biggest piece is we think that the lag between permits and starts is a bit longer. The cycle time is a little longer. You saw large builders pulling large quantity of permits and doing it to beat code changes, doing it to beat the rush. Everybody thought the market was going up. And they haven't put those starts in the ground as quickly as the traditional custom builders would have. And I think we all know the large nationals, the big guys are winning, right? They've got a bigger share of the pie. We think that's causing a little bit of distortion in the starts number, that, that will settle out as the year progresses. But at least early on, it overstated starts a bit. The other pieces are pieces we've talked about, right? Maybe another third of it is probably related to the pricing changes. A lot of that is vendor. Vendors have cut. We talked about EVP, Doors, Millwork. There are a bunch of categories that have had to readjust to the current demand and they have adjusted prices in response. So, that's an important piece. And another roughly third is in that category of mix, right? It's what we're seeing in terms of, if you think about the traditional good, better, best, you're talking about best to better, better to good, good to let's not do it. It's that things we were talking about before with regard to going from basement construction to slab may not sound like a big deal, but that percent is changing in the statistics and that has a meaningful decline in the value of product that goes into the house. So, rough categories, that's kind of how we think about it, but I'd be lying if I told you we had those numbers with precision. I think we've got good directionality, but we're going to have to see how that plays out. The interesting part of all of it, though, Mike, is it's so volatile, right? It moved quickly one way. There's no reason it can't move quickly the other. We're just going to stay close to it and make sure we're serving our customers the best we can.\nDave Rush: The only thing I would add, Mike, is it's primarily a top-line scenario for us that we have to manage through. Our margins, regardless, have stayed very consistent and very strong, and we're appreciative of that. But the best example is the one that Peter gave in Arizona. Forty-five percent number of houses that we've started, 15% is the increase in revenue. You can do that math and say in Arizona it's 30% impact. But at the end of the day, it varies depending on the market. What we're seeing, though, is we have the levers that we can pull to get the sale, depending on what the customer chooses to use to solve their problem. And at the same time, we're able to hold our margins because of having that ability to provide an alternative solution that works for both.\nMike Dahl: Got it. That's all really helpful. Thank you both.\nDave Rush: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: We'll go next Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. It's Rafe. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, I appreciate all the color so far and how we should think about the margin progression here. Just following up on the earlier comments about 60 basis points of headwinds from multi-family in '24 and another 50 basis points roughly in '25, how much of that is normalization of the multi-family margins off of excess levels versus multi-family mix. And how do you think about the multi-family margins today? Like how much have we seen a normalization off of the elevated margins you've had in the past? How much more is there to go?\nPeter Jackson: Good morning, Rafe. Thanks for the question. Yes, so the dynamic around the multi-family is a tricky one. We've tried to be really open and honest about what we're seeing, but it's not convenient in terms of how it's playing out. In other words, it didn't just stop on January 1st and we didn't have a nice clean turn. So, I don't have nice clean numbers last year or this year. So, there's a little bit of this you're probably going to poke at, but I can give you sort of my best sense of the directionality. We continue to see strong business in multi-family throughout all of last year that really began to turn in that Q1 window. We are seeing meaningful declines in our margins in what we're seeing starting in Q1 and stronger in Q2, kind of that 50 to a 100 basis points in those periods headwind driven by multi-family, right? That's sort of the combination of the mixed shift because it's all value-added and that downward shift within the category. So, with that in mind, we do expect it to continue this year. I think I mentioned from a dollar perspective, Q2 is going to be a chunky one, right? That was going to hurt a lot and obviously it did, but we will continue to see headwinds throughout the year. Again, with that kind of rough average of around 60 basis points, 50 to 70, give me a band around it based on timing, but overall impact on the company from the full multi-family segment of our business.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. That's helpful. And then, you had an -- in the prepared remarks, there's a comment that I thought was interesting. They're talking about how given the strength of the base gross margin, you sort of see more opportunity to go after profitable shares going forward. How do you think about how your market share trended is kind of in the first-half of this year? And do you expect any changes going forward? And does any of that have to do with some of the mixed impacts that you're thinking about? Have you seen Builders multi-source more? Has that been a headwind? And then going forward, do you expect to try to take market share? Like, what are your expectations there?\nDave Rush: Rafe, this is Dave. I would tell you what we're looking at is a disciplined approach, right? We want to identify opportunities where it's a volume where we have an opportunity to have a win-win with our customer, where we can leverage that incremental volume against our fixed costs, whether it be manufactured product or even distributed product, and offset the volume incentive that we may use to go after that business. So, it will be a targeted approach. It'll be a disciplined approach. It will be only where the volume makes sense. And there has to be a win-win solution there. Thankfully, we had all the guys in the first part of July, and that was the focus of the meeting. And they all had a plethora of opportunities. They felt that description, and we're going to execute that strategy in the back half.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nDave Rush: Thanks, Rafe.\nOperator: We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc.\nTrey Grooms: Hey, good morning, everyone. I appreciate all the color you've given thus far. And this one's I guess so on just the -- on lumber, kind of the competitive pricing that we've seen on the commodity lumber side. Nothing new, but wondering if you're seeing this become more widespread or intense, given the kind of weaker environment. But also, on the trusses and value-add, with multi-family pulling back, which was clearly taking up a lot of that supply, are you seeing any more competitive behavior on the truss side or value-add side now that multi-family has started to normalize?\nDave Rush: Hey, Trey. Thanks for the question. On the commodity part of the question, we always see the players in the marketplace that take commodities too low because it's all they have to offer. And we're not choosing to play in that game. What we will do, though, is partner with our customers that commodity becomes part of a package, and we value the overall packaging and create incentives to buy all products from us, whereby through the value-add piece of that package, we can earn back a level of whatever volume incentive we provide. So, our focus on building share has still got to be a win-win. It's not going to be only a win for the customer or only a win for BFS. It won't be sustainable if that's the way you approach it. With specifically the value-add, where we still and will maintain an advantage is over our efficiencies. We have continued to drive efficiencies, and I said in the earlier comment, if we're in one shift, we're as efficient as we can possibly be when we're one shift. So, we have the ability to leverage incremental volume in that idle capacity and, again, create a more profitable net-net number for us, even as we provide an incentive to customers for the incremental volume. So, that's kind of how, even as we've managed and tried to pick opportunities to drive the top line, we've been able to hold on to the market.\nTrey Grooms: Yes. That's helpful. I heard Peter mention something about price pass-through, and I think it was when you were talking about the value-add side, just trying to make sure I understand what that comment meant.\nDave Rush: I'll answer it, then I'll let you follow up. That's actually when we get a cost reduction from our vendors on products, and we immediately pass that through. It is, again, impactful on the top line because now we're selling a lower-cost product, but our margin profile is not impacted, and we're kind of operating under the same model from a profitability standpoint. Is that right?\nPeter Jackson: Yes. Just to echo that same thought, we do stay very focused on making sure we're acting in a disciplined manner with our customers in key categories. As commodities, we pass it all through. A little color on that, I guess. I'm a bit disappointed. I would have hoped to have seen a lumber industry be a little more intentional about making money. Not everyone is a bad actor in that category, but I remain -- I continue to be surprised at how many players are willing to sustain loss or losing bills, business units, whatever you want to call it, longer than I would have expected. There's an awful lot of weeping and gnashing of the teeth out there, but not a lot of behavior that would indicate that we're moving in the right direction. Hopefully, we will, but that's disappointing. I think what you see are weaker lumber numbers that we absolutely pass through to our customers. What I was referring to before are certain price cuts that we've seen, specific actions taken by EWP players, Doors players, Millwork players, and some others where we've seen low to mid-single-digit reductions in overall sales attributable to nothing else than customer -- the prices we give our customers are adjusted because of the prices we're charged by our vendors.\nTrey Grooms: Yes, got it. Just a quick one for my follow-up, there's very I guess, differing views on kind of the multi-family outlook and maybe how quickly that could take to normalize. I'd love to maybe get your thoughts on that. I think you mentioned there may be a little bit more headwind to come in 2025, but any color on maybe the timing of when we might see that stabilization and multi-family? And then, I know it's hard to say, but directionally, do you think we could see maybe a pretty quick rebound there after it does find some stabilization, or do you feel like we could tread water there at that much lower level there for a while?\nDave Rush: Yes, Trey. I'll tell you the dynamic we've seen in 2024 is, in addition to people hesitant to start new projects, we've actually seen existing projects get delayed and pushed pretty consistently throughout the year. The project's still on the board. The project's still going to get done, but it's getting pushed, which, quite frankly, was part of the top-line headwind in the first-half, even though multi-family's a small piece of the overall. New projects take so long to get underway that I think the order that has to happen is we have to have the cost of capital come down. Then there's going to be new projects that come out of the ground, but they're going to take a while to get going. The one thing we are seeing, though, is a gap currently that is in favor of multi-family, where rental rates are now less than mortgage rates for essentially the same type of living arrangement. So, a lot of the excess capacity that we feel like we came into the year with, with multi-family, we do believe will burn off during the rest of this year, which will encourage a quicker rebound in multi-family in 2025. The problem is it just takes so long.\nTrey Grooms: Yes. Okay. Thanks for the color, Dave. I really appreciate it.\nDave Rush: Truss wood is still a very profitable business for us at these levels and will continue to be at the levels we expect to have through 2024 and into 2025.\nTrey Grooms: Great. Thank you very much.\nDave Rush: Thanks, Trey.\nOperator: We'll go now to Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just on the value of new starts declining, I guess, could you give us a sense for -- I know you gave the Phoenix example, but maybe overall what it's down and how much of that's from smaller square footage and how much of it is that lower mix of value at?\nPeter Jackson: Good morning, Adam. Honestly, to know that answer with precision, I'd probably call you guys. We know there are data points that prove our point. What we don't have is confidence in the individual buckets. It's way too volatile and way too customer specific, regionally influenced for us. But again, if we're missing 20 points in terms of where is that sale, I think directionally, the biggest third is on the extended time, it's taking between permit and sale. We know another chunk of it is on the value, just the price is charged and the rest of it is that mix component. It's square footage. It's smaller. It's cheaper. Five to seven, I don't know. I'm guessing, to be honest.\nDave Rush: We've done enough proof points to know that it's a thing, right? It's harder to decide what part of what aspect is -- for example, we took a bid for a national builder from last year and compared the exact same house, the exact same model this year. And it was down mid-teens in overall sale opportunity in the exact same house. So, we don't have that in every market and every builder, but at the end of the day, again, it was another proof point that what we suspected was happening is actually happening. And directionally, we know what we're dealing with. And again, as that changes, the encouraging thing is the margin profile is not also changing. And that's -- I'd love to have all the volume that we could possibly get, but at the end of the day, I at least want to keep the balance between what we're selling and what we're making and what we're selling and check along the way.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay, got it. Thanks. And then, just a couple more, just on the digital sales, the incremental sales, you expect in '24, I think you've talked about $200 million in the past. Is that still expected for the year? And then, just on M&A, any changes in the strategy there given the increase in the share repurchase activity and authorization?\nDave Rush: Yes. Let me talk a little about digital. As we started to roll out the digital and the adoption, I think it probably isn't a surprise that we have gone first to our employees. And we've gotten them up to speed on the benefits of digital. So, they can more fully explain to their customers; the customers that we've gone to initially have been existing customers. So, it's while we give you that stat of orders through the system of $250 million, now we expect fully that existing customers push in orders through the system. That business we probably -- we have already had, we would have still gotten had we not had digital. But we still want to track it. It's an indication of acceptance. And so, the incremental business we get is going to come more from new customers, and as we continue to get existing customers more comfortable, incremental wallet from those guys. But, that obviously is going to be more in the form of a hockey stick. So, no, we are not giving up on the $200 million for this year. At this point in time, it is admittedly a tougher point to get a little bit to the hockey stick. But we still know that hockey stick is going be there. And, the acceptance for getting even as it is from existing customers is really encouraging. I'll let Peter talk to the M&A piece.\nPeter Jackson: Yes, I 100% agree on digital. It is encouraging. The momentum is good. On M&A, the momentum is good there too. I think you've seen the increasing number of acquisition targets that we are closing on. Still little bit smaller, but we really like to pace. The pipeline still looks very good. We are still pleased with the potential targets out there. And, the way that negotiations are going. Certainly, very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the business in a healthy way with really, really nice assets like the ones we added this quarter.\nAdam Baumgarten: Great. Thanks. Best of luck.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear next from David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Peter, in your non-guidance, that 31% gross margin exiting the year, when you talk about the 2025, you said 100 basis points of headwinds. Fifty from multi-family makes sense. But then the other 50, is that corporations? And, just wondering if could explain that a little bit more. Is that just lower operating leverage because it will lower levels of starts and raw demand, or is that something else?\nPeter Jackson:\n,:\nDavid Manthey: Got it, okay. Then on the EBITDA margin, in the base business which you raise by 20 basis points to 13.7%, could you share with us the source of your increased confidence despite the kind of lackluster macros here? And also, I assume that your 2026 ranges in that 14 for midpoint is intact as well? Is that right?\nPeter Jackson: So, the second-half of the question, yes, our '26 is still intact. We would need volumes to rebound, but we feel good about the core business. And I think that informs where we are dialing in on the EBITDA number for that base business comp. We are getting better and better clarity around what our margin profile looks like in a healthy market, what our profile looks like in the current market, and being able to dial in the breakout from commodities kind of seeing the full-year really leveling out right around that 400 level without a ton of volatility, a bit, but not a ton is giving us the ability to dial it in a little bit more to what we think is a real sort of neutral commodity level or performance. Core business is still very healthy. As much as we wanted to be bigger, I think, what you're seeing here and what their base business chart lays out is a business that's really been transformed based on what we sell and how we service our customers, and the stability of that core business, even though you've seen kind of some ups and downs in the starts performance at the overall market.\nDavid Manthey: Sounds good. Thank you very much.\nDave Rush: Thank you, Dave.\nOperator: We will go now to Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.\nReuben Garner: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to harp on the multi-family, but I do have a quick follow-up about the top line for next year. I think your business is where multi-family starts are little over 40% off the peak level, but I think your business is limited to 25% to 30% range. Does that imply that at this current run rate for starts we have another 10 to 15 points of top line pressure within your multi-family business in '25?\nDave Rush: So, that's a tough question. It's very specific. Greetings, Reuben. Thank you for the question. Appreciate it. The question is very specific, and I'm not sure I can go all the way down, what I say is we do expect there to be lapping of the rest of the decline in multi-family. So, certainly we expect there to be continued headwinds on the sales line, kind of in that maybe 400-ish range, based on what we are seeing now, and around 200 of headwinds on the EBITDA line for multi-family, but remember, multi-family is all in. You got the full portfolio of multi-family products when we are talking about multi-family. I know in the past I've thrown out some color around truss. I'm going to try not to do that anymore, because I think I just muddy the waters, but when we are talking about the total, based on what we are seeing today, I would say that's the trend now. Certainly some headwind, but multi-family is only a 11% of our business this year. It's going to climb a little bit further next year in maybe smaller percentage, it's just a declining impact on the overall, as it strings back and kind of normalizes. Does that answer your question?\nReuben Garner: Yes, it does. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, can you update us pre-2020, the way it would work is the builders would set up a contract that you guys I think, at the time it averaged somewhere between 60 and 120 days for the framing package, and during the last few years that strung significantly. Are we still -- the length of this contract is still in the 30-day range and lined up with inventory. Are we seeing that move that all with kind of the reset of the commodity market?\nPeter Jackson: It's still in the range with how we buy our inventory, which is what we have always tried to do. As long as we have the ability to cover what we soiled, we are willing to work with our builders however we need to match that up, also, with how they priced their homes. And it hasn't gotten to the point where it was 90-plus or whatever. But we are generally in a 45-day exposure rate, but that's exactly how much inventory we hold and how we carry it.\nDave Rush: Yes. There has only been some pressure back. There are certain players that have been less disciplined. We've definitely tried to hold the ground on what we think is good, smart way of coding in the market, but today's point, we've tried to increase those 30 days numbers we talked about, back during sort of the busyness of the supply chain issues, where you really had to move it quick. Now that we are back into more of a normal cadence, where we got that 45-day-ish line of sight, if you will, between what's on the ground, what's on the order, it's a lot easier to work with customers and tie it together and use some 60-day terms, that sort of thing. We are still absolutely opposed to 90 and 120-day terms, because we think that's the wrong discipline and the wrong way of approaching the market.\nPeter Jackson: Well, and at that point, we actually do take market risk. I mean, what we are trying to do is mitigate their risk and mitigate our risk; we work with them to try to find that middle ground and make sure that they're covered and we are covered. And we'll adjust off of that, and touch markets specific if that solve the problem for our customer. But in general, we are in that 45-day range.\nReuben Garner: Exactly where I was getting at; thanks, guys. Appreciate it, and good luck going forward.\nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Reuben.\nOperator: We will go now to Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I had, when you think about lumber prices in the way you guys look at it, talking about $400 kind of being the base assumption, could you talk about what deflation you're seeing in 2Q '24 versus where it was 2Q '23?\nPeter Jackson: We called it out in terms of what went through COGS. It was just basically zero, right, at 23 or whatever, small 3% headwind. That is something that does move a little out of sequence with what you see in random blanks. It is going to be a headwind in the second-half versus first-half, which is how you get to that sort of full-year number that's a little below the 400 level.\nJay McCanless: Okay, thank you. And then, the other question I had, if you look at -- I came with slide a ton, but commodity number was up I think, 13% in sales for the second quarter, that's almost double the rate of single-family starts growth that the census numbers had for the national readings as well the south readings, I guess, with these in general serving down a little bit, are you trying to outgrow and take even more market share on the commodity side until value-add maybe comes back a little bit, because those were pretty impressive numbers, where of the rest of the market was?\nPeter Jackson: Well, Jay, we always wanted to take all the shares about that comment. Now, in all honest and all sincerity, we always see a couple month lag, and if you think about the Q1 starts number, that was up in the 20s. So, you are just that swash over a little bit into Q2. We are seeing a comparable performance in the business. We will certainly see a graphic, like Dave said. We think when there're opportunities to lean in and take share, we are going to keep doing it. But that's not really the explanation, if you will.\nJay McCanless: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.\nPeter Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go now to Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.\nSteven Ramsey: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wrap my two questions into one here, the product mix at 49%, pretty impressive even with the complexity headwinds that you have, certainly love the dynamic here, but do you think that housing market normalizes complexity going up from current levels over the next couple of years to reach your plan, or do you needed that complexity level to move up, or can the current complexity level allow for that to allow you to reach your long-term targets? Thanks.\nDave Rush: Yes. Thanks for the question. Keep in mind, the value-added products, the movement is within the category. The engineered wood products are still value-adds. So, as you go from truss engineered wood, we are not leaving the value-add product category, we are moving within it. The sale opportunity is less, but again, our margin profiles have held in there. And we are doing what we can to keep our customers addressing affordability, and at the same time, maintaining their margins as well. So, I don't see the shift in the incremental value-add products will come as the market returns to normal [technical difficulty] for those products in general. And right now we offer the full spectrum. We will send you sticks if you don't want value-add. But this we go from READY-FRAME to panel, to panel and truss. So, fully installed framing packages, all which you have would tunnel into the value-added product category in total. And we would expect it to maintain, for sure, and incrementally grow as housing starts return to normal levels.\nSteven Ramsey: Excellent, thank you.\nDave Rush: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session, and the Builders FirstSource second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time, and everyone have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Rush",
            "content": "Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. As we continue to operate in a complex environment, I'm proud of our resilient second quarter results, highlighted by our mid-teens EBITDA margin, which demonstrates the strength of our differentiated business model, and the hard work of our extraordinary team members. While we continue to see the expected affordability challenges and normalization in multi-family, we are executing our strategy by controlling what we can control, investing in value-added solutions, and driving adoption of our industry-leading digital platform, our ability to solve industry pain points with our best-in-class product portfolio and exceptional customer service makes us a trusted partner as our customers navigate this complex macro landscape. While near-term market dynamics are challenging as starts have lost momentum, we remain focused on executing our strategy in the weeks and months ahead, and we are well-positioned for growth as long-term housing tailwinds remain intact. Moving to our strategic pillars, on slide three, we continue to invest in value-added products, installed services, and digital solutions [technical difficulty] -- we are providing our customers with a more efficient and cost-effective way to manage home construction. This leads to increased customer stickiness, new business, and improved operational efficiency for BFS. We have a robust set of continuous improvement initiatives focused on leveraging our scale while delivering the highest quality products and services to our customers. Our highly experienced team members are delivering these critical initiatives while serving our customers with excellence and integrity every day. Finally, we continue to allocate capital in a disciplined manner with a proven M&A strategy and a track record of buying back shares at attractive prices over the long-term. Turning to our second quarter highlights on slide four, while navigating a market challenged by crosscurrents, we have seen softer than expected sales. However, we delivered strong gross margins of nearly 33% in Q2, and our adjusted EBITDA margin has remained in the mid-teens or better for 13 consecutive quarters. Our durable margin profile is a key proof point of our transformed business model and our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Given the strength of our base gross margin, we see opportunities to more aggressively go after profitable share. We have grown our mix of value-added products over the past five years, improved our manufacturing processes and efficiency, and positioned ourselves at the forefront of homebuilding innovation. Let's move to slide five where we show how we're executing our strategy. Our full suite of value-added products and services remains a competitive advantage for BFS, and continues to bolster our partnerships with customers. We're pleased with our progress on digital as we continue to hear great feedback from customers and see increasing levels of adoption each week. We demonstrated operational rigor by delivering $37 million in productivity savings in Q2, and had driven $77 million year-to-date primarily through more efficient manufacturing and procurement initiatives. As I've spoken about in the past, we continue to use playbooks to drive growth in our Installed Services business. I'm pleased that our installed sales increased by 15% year-over-year as we focus on helping customers address labor challenges. Our managers have best-in-class information to help them navigate this dynamic environment and make effective real-time decisions. We are also maximizing operational flexibility, and have consolidated seven facilities, while maintaining our service levels to our customers with on-time and in-full delivery rate of over 90%. We will remain disciplined managers of discretionary spending no matter the operating environment. We are continuing to take actions into the second-half of the year to flex the business where appropriate. The single-family growth momentum, occurring earlier in 2024, has stalled as the interest rate cuts have not materialized and starts have come in lower than expected. In addition, the value of a new start has fallen as the market has adapted to affordability challenges. Multi-family continues to be a headwind amid muted activity and relative to our record performance last year, which is creating an increasingly tough comparison. This was expected and detailed on prior [calls] (ph) as multi-family continues to normalize. Even at today's levels, multi-family continues to be a very profitable business for us. In the current environment, builders have employed specs, smaller and simpler homes, and interest rate buy-downs to help buyers find affordable options. Builders of all sizes are having to navigate affordability issues along with regulatory, land development and infrastructure challenges. Smaller builders have been especially impacted by the availability of land and limited options to buy down rates. We are partnering with our customers to help them lower the cost of homes for consumers, as well as maintain their margins. This includes balancing our product mix to address their needs while passing through lower material costs. For example, when engineered wood products or EWP was constrained, we supplied a larger number of higher-value floor trusses. As EWP supply normalized and prices came down, we have been able to provide customers with more EWP, and have sold fewer floor trusses, helping to specifically address the builders' biggest challenge, affordability. We have what the builders want and do what's right by them. Although this trend means less sales in gross profit dollars, our margin profile remains strong. We have the operational and financial flexibility needed to partner with our customers to meet their needs and capture growth opportunities. Coming to M&A, on slide six, we continue to pursue attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In the second quarter, we completed three deals with aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $72 million. In May, we acquired Schoeneman's Building Materials, which we detailed on our Q1 call, and TRS Components which establishes truss manufacturing within Metro Detroit. In June, we acquired RPM Wood Products, which enhances our ability to serve high-end custom builders in Northeast Florida. Finally, in July, we acquired Western Truss & Components, adding truss capacity in Flagstaff, Arizona area, and CRi SoCal, a dealer and installer of high-end windows and doors in Orange County. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. Our disciplined approach to M&A includes increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions, and enhancing customer retention. Our M&A pipeline remains healthy, and we believe we can continue to acquire in a fragmented market. On slide seven, we provide an update on capital allocation. In addition to the three tuck-in acquisitions during the second quarter, we repurchased nearly $1 billion of shares. I'm happy to announce that our Board has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase plan. As proven by our track record, we'll continue to buy back shares while allocating capital to high-return opportunities. We remain on track to strategically deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026, as outlined at Investor Day, last December. Now, let's turn to slide eight and nine for an update on our digital strategy. As the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space, we believe BFS digital tools will be transformative for the industry and a substantial driver of organic growth. We have seen strong adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller builders even as they endure a challenging operating backdrop. We've had broad acceptance of the platform so far, including interest from multiple top 200 builders. Since launching in late February, we have seen the value of orders placed through the digital platform go from nearly 0 to over $250 million. Year-to-date through Q2, incremental sales have totaled $45 million. While we still have a long way to go, we remain confident in our ability to meet our target of $1 billion in incremental sales by 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers. I am thrilled to share a significant achievement that underscores our team members' commitment to making a positive impact in our communities. At our recent annual charity event, we successfully raised over $1 million on behalf of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. This brings total contributions to nearly $12 million since first partnering with LLS in 2006. These funds are crucial to advance in research, patient support, and advocacy programs aimed at finding treatments and cures for blood cancers. I want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our industry partners and sponsors whose overwhelming support made this successful event impossible. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Thanks, Peter. Let me close by reiterating that we continue to execute as evidenced by our strong profit margins and cash flow generation. Our resilient business model allows us to win in any environment. In 2020, we had an 8.7% base business adjusted EBITDA margin at 991,000 single-family starts. This year, we expect the mid-teens adjusted EBITDA margin at a lower level of housing starts. This demonstrates the resiliency of our transformed business and is a strong base to build from as the housing market grows to meet demand. I am confident in the long-term strength of the industry due to the significant housing underbill and favorable demographic trends. We are well positioned to take advantage of those tailwinds, which will help drive growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We believe we are the unquestioned leader in addressing our customers' pain points through our investments in value-added products, digital tools, and installed services. Our proven playbook for growth and robust free cash flow generation will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. Matt, the only thing I'd add is our focus and continuing focus on doing more for the customer with installed, doing more for the customer with value-add, those are higher margin profile products that we held, all said, any start variation. One thing I would add on the value-add components specifically, Matt, is even as truss volumes declined our ability to more efficiently manufacture increases. As we go from two shifts to one shift, our second shift is the least profitable, for obvious reasons, but you put up with that because you leverage 100% of the fixed costs. When we go to one shift, that's our most profitable shift, so even as the top line may be less because of the demand being less, the ability to maintain margins is actually easier because we're most efficient in that one shift. The only thing I would add, Mike, is it's primarily a top-line scenario for us that we have to manage through. Our margins, regardless, have stayed very consistent and very strong, and we're appreciative of that. But the best example is the one that Peter gave in Arizona. Forty-five percent number of houses that we've started, 15% is the increase in revenue. You can do that math and say in Arizona it's 30% impact. But at the end of the day, it varies depending on the market. What we're seeing, though, is we have the levers that we can pull to get the sale, depending on what the customer chooses to use to solve their problem. And at the same time, we're able to hold our margins because of having that ability to provide an alternative solution that works for both. Thanks, Mike. Rafe, this is Dave. I would tell you what we're looking at is a disciplined approach, right? We want to identify opportunities where it's a volume where we have an opportunity to have a win-win with our customer, where we can leverage that incremental volume against our fixed costs, whether it be manufactured product or even distributed product, and offset the volume incentive that we may use to go after that business. So, it will be a targeted approach. It'll be a disciplined approach. It will be only where the volume makes sense. And there has to be a win-win solution there. Thankfully, we had all the guys in the first part of July, and that was the focus of the meeting. And they all had a plethora of opportunities. They felt that description, and we're going to execute that strategy in the back half. Thanks, Rafe. Hey, Trey. Thanks for the question. On the commodity part of the question, we always see the players in the marketplace that take commodities too low because it's all they have to offer. And we're not choosing to play in that game. What we will do, though, is partner with our customers that commodity becomes part of a package, and we value the overall packaging and create incentives to buy all products from us, whereby through the value-add piece of that package, we can earn back a level of whatever volume incentive we provide. So, our focus on building share has still got to be a win-win. It's not going to be only a win for the customer or only a win for BFS. It won't be sustainable if that's the way you approach it. With specifically the value-add, where we still and will maintain an advantage is over our efficiencies. We have continued to drive efficiencies, and I said in the earlier comment, if we're in one shift, we're as efficient as we can possibly be when we're one shift. So, we have the ability to leverage incremental volume in that idle capacity and, again, create a more profitable net-net number for us, even as we provide an incentive to customers for the incremental volume. So, that's kind of how, even as we've managed and tried to pick opportunities to drive the top line, we've been able to hold on to the market. I'll answer it, then I'll let you follow up. That's actually when we get a cost reduction from our vendors on products, and we immediately pass that through. It is, again, impactful on the top line because now we're selling a lower-cost product, but our margin profile is not impacted, and we're kind of operating under the same model from a profitability standpoint. Is that right? Yes, Trey. I'll tell you the dynamic we've seen in 2024 is, in addition to people hesitant to start new projects, we've actually seen existing projects get delayed and pushed pretty consistently throughout the year. The project's still on the board. The project's still going to get done, but it's getting pushed, which, quite frankly, was part of the top-line headwind in the first-half, even though multi-family's a small piece of the overall. New projects take so long to get underway that I think the order that has to happen is we have to have the cost of capital come down. Then there's going to be new projects that come out of the ground, but they're going to take a while to get going. The one thing we are seeing, though, is a gap currently that is in favor of multi-family, where rental rates are now less than mortgage rates for essentially the same type of living arrangement. So, a lot of the excess capacity that we feel like we came into the year with, with multi-family, we do believe will burn off during the rest of this year, which will encourage a quicker rebound in multi-family in 2025. The problem is it just takes so long. Truss wood is still a very profitable business for us at these levels and will continue to be at the levels we expect to have through 2024 and into 2025. Thanks, Trey. We've done enough proof points to know that it's a thing, right? It's harder to decide what part of what aspect is -- for example, we took a bid for a national builder from last year and compared the exact same house, the exact same model this year. And it was down mid-teens in overall sale opportunity in the exact same house. So, we don't have that in every market and every builder, but at the end of the day, again, it was another proof point that what we suspected was happening is actually happening. And directionally, we know what we're dealing with. And again, as that changes, the encouraging thing is the margin profile is not also changing. And that's -- I'd love to have all the volume that we could possibly get, but at the end of the day, I at least want to keep the balance between what we're selling and what we're making and what we're selling and check along the way. Yes. Let me talk a little about digital. As we started to roll out the digital and the adoption, I think it probably isn't a surprise that we have gone first to our employees. And we've gotten them up to speed on the benefits of digital. So, they can more fully explain to their customers; the customers that we've gone to initially have been existing customers. So, it's while we give you that stat of orders through the system of $250 million, now we expect fully that existing customers push in orders through the system. That business we probably -- we have already had, we would have still gotten had we not had digital. But we still want to track it. It's an indication of acceptance. And so, the incremental business we get is going to come more from new customers, and as we continue to get existing customers more comfortable, incremental wallet from those guys. But, that obviously is going to be more in the form of a hockey stick. So, no, we are not giving up on the $200 million for this year. At this point in time, it is admittedly a tougher point to get a little bit to the hockey stick. But we still know that hockey stick is going be there. And, the acceptance for getting even as it is from existing customers is really encouraging. I'll let Peter talk to the M&A piece. Thank you, Dave. So, that's a tough question. It's very specific. Greetings, Reuben. Thank you for the question. Appreciate it. The question is very specific, and I'm not sure I can go all the way down, what I say is we do expect there to be lapping of the rest of the decline in multi-family. So, certainly we expect there to be continued headwinds on the sales line, kind of in that maybe 400-ish range, based on what we are seeing now, and around 200 of headwinds on the EBITDA line for multi-family, but remember, multi-family is all in. You got the full portfolio of multi-family products when we are talking about multi-family. I know in the past I've thrown out some color around truss. I'm going to try not to do that anymore, because I think I just muddy the waters, but when we are talking about the total, based on what we are seeing today, I would say that's the trend now. Certainly some headwind, but multi-family is only a 11% of our business this year. It's going to climb a little bit further next year in maybe smaller percentage, it's just a declining impact on the overall, as it strings back and kind of normalizes. Does that answer your question? Yes. There has only been some pressure back. There are certain players that have been less disciplined. We've definitely tried to hold the ground on what we think is good, smart way of coding in the market, but today's point, we've tried to increase those 30 days numbers we talked about, back during sort of the busyness of the supply chain issues, where you really had to move it quick. Now that we are back into more of a normal cadence, where we got that 45-day-ish line of sight, if you will, between what's on the ground, what's on the order, it's a lot easier to work with customers and tie it together and use some 60-day terms, that sort of thing. We are still absolutely opposed to 90 and 120-day terms, because we think that's the wrong discipline and the wrong way of approaching the market. Yes. Thanks for the question. Keep in mind, the value-added products, the movement is within the category. The engineered wood products are still value-adds. So, as you go from truss engineered wood, we are not leaving the value-add product category, we are moving within it. The sale opportunity is less, but again, our margin profiles have held in there. And we are doing what we can to keep our customers addressing affordability, and at the same time, maintaining their margins as well. So, I don't see the shift in the incremental value-add products will come as the market returns to normal [technical difficulty] for those products in general. And right now we offer the full spectrum. We will send you sticks if you don't want value-add. But this we go from READY-FRAME to panel, to panel and truss. So, fully installed framing packages, all which you have would tunnel into the value-added product category in total. And we would expect it to maintain, for sure, and incrementally grow as housing starts return to normal levels. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We were able to effectively navigate a softer than expected housing environment during the second quarter by leaning into the pillars of our strategy and operating model. Leveraging our fortress balance sheet and exceptional financial flexibility, we executed nearly $1 billion of share repurchases into stock price weakness. And, made three tuck-in acquisitions to enhance and expand our footprint. We believe the sustainable competitive advantages and our extensive geographic coverage, value-added solutions, and strong financial position are enabling us to successfully manage market dynamics and deliver long-term value creation. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our second quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our revised 2024 guidance and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our second quarter performance on slides 10 and 11. Net sales were $4.5 billion. A decrease of 1.6% as core organic sales declined 3.8% with the expected multi-family downward trend. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 1.9% and commodity inflation of 0.3%. The core organic sales decline was driven by a multi-family decline of 31%. Partially offset by increases in single-family of 1% amid higher starts and repair & remodel of 1.5%. I want to take a moment to discuss the variables impacting the disconnect between single-family start and core organic sales. As a reminder, historically there is a roughly two-month lag between a start and our first sale. In the current environment, we are seeing that lag extend as the relative timing of permit starts and completions has shifted in response to the changing market. Second, we have seen a meaningful decline in the sales opportunity of a start in 2024 as the size, complexity, and value of the average home has fallen. These changes are logical given the affordability challenges in the market. But, it means that we are seeing less dollars per start despite our strong operating performance. As an example, looking at the Phoenix market we are supplying material to roughly 45% more homes. But, our dollar sales are only about 15%. To summarize, despite a market where starts are smaller, less complex, and cheaper, we remain the market leader and will continue to deliver superior results. During the second quarter as we signaled and expected, multi-family declined more than 31% as we lacked the prior-year's strong comps. R&R and Other improved by over 1% given our retail strength in the faster growing West. Value-added products still represented approximately 49% of our net sales during the second quarter, despite the headwinds from multi-family. Gross profit was $1.5 billion. A decrease of approximately 8% compared to the prior-year period. Gross margins were 32.8%, decreasing 240 basis points, primarily driven by ongoing normalization, particularly in multi-family. SG&A decreased $45 million to $973 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation, partially offset by acquired operations. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased 70 basis points to 21.8%. The team has done an excellent job of managing SG&A, and we are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $670 million, down approximately 13%, primarily driven by lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15% down 200 basis points from the prior year. On a sequential basis, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 110 basis points, primarily driven by operating leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. Adjusted net income of $420 million was down $78 million from the prior year primarily due to lower gross profit partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.50, a decrease of 10% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.22 per share for the second quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow balance sheet and liquidity on slide 12. Our Q2 operating cash flow was approximately $452 million, an increase of $61 million, mainly attributable to a decrease in net working capital and more than offsetting almost a $100 million decline in adjusted EBITDA. This is a proof point of how our business generates a robust amount of cash in any environment. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $85 million, and free cash flow was approximately $367 million. For the last 12 months ended June 30th, our free cash flow yield was approximately 10%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 24%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.4 times, while base business leverage was 1.7 times. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of $1.6 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility, and approximately $100 million in cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the second quarter, we repurchased roughly 5.8 million shares for approximately $990 million at an average stock price of $170.01 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August of 2021, we have repurchased 45% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $76.65 per share for $7.1 billion. As Dave mentioned, the board approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns. Now let's turn to our outlook on slide 13, which we are lowering, given a softer than anticipated housing market and weaker commodities. For full-year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $16.4 billion to $17.2 billion versus our previous range of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion versus the previous range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 13.4% to 14% versus the previous range of 14% to 15%. And we are updating our 2024 full-year gross margin guidance to the range of 31.5% to 32.5% from 30% to 33%. This also remains in line with our long-term expectations of 30% to 33% at normalized single-family starts of 1 million to 1.1 million. Our long-term margin profile reflects a greater mix of value-added products, recent acquisition and disciplined pricing management. We expect full-year 2024 pre-cash low of $1 to $1.2, assuming an average commodity price in the range of $380 to $400 per thousand board feet. Our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions. While we do not typically give quarterly guidance, we wanted to provide color for Q3, given ongoing housing uncertainty and multi-family normalization. We expect Q3 net sales to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $575 million and $625 million in Q3. Turning to slides 15 and 16, as a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and resiliency of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business, where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $16.8 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.3 billion at a margin of 13.7%, which reflects a roughly net zero impact from commodities. For context, slide 16 shows that our 2020 base business adjusted EBITDA was roughly $1.1 billion at 991,000 single-family starts. And we're expecting better adjusted EBITDA at lower single-family starts this year. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that our exceptional positioning and financial flexibility gives us the confidence in our ability to execute our strategy and drive long-term growth. The Investor Day goals we laid out in December remain achievable, assuming a return to normalized single-family starts of $1.1 million in 2026. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts. Morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. Yes, so margins has been an important factor for us. It's changed a lot over the years. We certainly get a lot of questions on it. We're pleased with how margins have performed so far, right? We knew normalization was going to happen. We saw it coming particularly on the multi-family side, but we're certainly pleased with how it's progressed. If you look into the future, into the second-half of this year and into next year, more normalization is what we've outlined. And I think that we've been pretty clear about that. Hopefully no change in what expectations are. When it comes to '25 and the exit rate, so I want to be real clear, right, we don't have a crystal ball, we don't know. This is not intended to be guide for '25. We haven't done that work yet. But based on what we're seeing right now, we're coming out of this year at roughly 975 on starts, give or take. Based on that, we're kind of at that level of performance that we're guiding to, right in that 32% range. As you think about 2025 based on what we're seeing right now, we think it's probably another 100 basis points at this level, like if you just extend the line out you'd see another 100 basis points of headwind into 2025 made up of the two pieces you'd expect, right? About half of that is multi-family, and about half of that is core operations based on what we're seeing. So, we're definitely closer to the end than the beginning in terms of the normalization based on what we see. The multi-family is a story, no question. We think that if you look back to last year, we called out a little over 100 basis points of tailwind from multi-family. We'll give back 60, maybe a little -- right in that range basis points in '24, with the other 50 basis points coming in '25. That's probably about a couple hundred million dollars worth of EBITDA headwind from multi-family. And we feel like the rest of the business is performing really well, and we'll be in a strong position to overcome that as we get into '25. All right, so one question in 26 parts; let's see if I get them all. So, overall, you're right, we have seen a shift in commodities, right? So the market's been weaker, the -- both lumber and OSB, OSB kind of ran up for a little bit, had absolutely reset and pulled back. That is largest component of the dollar value change in sales that we've called out. So, of the $1.2 billion, more than half of that is just the commodity valuation change. What that means to the business in terms of the rest of the output called down on EBITDA, the bulk of EBITDA call-down is deleveraging, it's the vast majority of it, right? It's the smaller business absorbs less of the fixed overhead costs. You can see this quarter; we had some pretty substantial improvement just because we are busiest in the summer months. We thought we'd be busier in the back-half than we're going to be, so we're giving some of that back. Value-add, more specifically, we continue to see strength. We continue to see the volumes moving very well, the demand is very strong; customers have consistently stayed with the product. We haven't seen a shift away from value-add broadly. What we are seeing and what we pointed out here -- what Dave pointed out in his remarks was really this mix dynamic, right? It goes to the customers focusing on affordability, how do they get cost out? One of the ways they're doing that is a shift within value-add, shifting from open-web truss to EWP, that's just -- it's a lower sales dollar value product, right? It's combined with a lot of other things. They're shrinking the square footage of the house, they're taking out basements, they're reducing the number of garages and bonus rooms. All things that are not a surprise, if you think about the affordability challenge. But that has had a broad pressure, that's not unique to value-add or not value-add. I think where value-add has seen pressure is really around the price pass-through in that type of mix. Volumes are still strong. Margins are still strong on the core product categories. Thanks, Matt. Morning, Mike. In short, yes, you got it right. You heard it right. We think we're around 32% this year. We think our exit rate is around 31% based on everything we're seeing today. This is not guide. It's not intended to be a crystal ball; it's just trying to give directionality. The short answer to that, and I think you've alluded to it, and so did Matt, our long-range normalized margins we're seeing are 30% to 33% at 1.1 million starts. This would indicate that we're going to be at 31% at 975,000 starts. What does that mean? Well, that means, right now, margins are strong. Ours are good. Ours are better than we expected, which is great. But it also means we're under pressure in a market that's got extra capacity versus what we're all dialed in for, which is 1.1 million-plus, right? So, that's the tug of war going on right now, and why we're not able to put our stake in the ground and claim it. We've got to see how this plays out. Pretty optimistic, like Dave said, about the overall market, the demos, the under build, it's good. That we think tone is playing out maybe belatedly but positively in terms of the interest rate environment right now. So, we'll see. But it's a strong business. It's really well-positioned, and margins look good. Yes, so that's -- it's a great question. We spent a lot of time on this. As we spend a lot of energy, we're trying to understand our business at a granular level. We have a lot of data. Unfortunately, it's a lot of data, right? So, the ability to really understand the mix impact of hundreds of thousands of SKUs at 570 locations in 80 markets, it's sometimes an adventure to really get through the noise to get the signal. I think earlier this year, you saw us reacting to what we were seeing, trying to understand it. I think the storyline around this whole value conversation is that the order of magnitude is bigger than we expected. I think the storyline around the timing of starts versus permits is again, order of magnitude, a little bigger than we expected. So, Q2, if you use our roughly two month lag, we've got about a 20 point gap that we're tracking down that we're saying, why aren't we up a lot more? And it's broken down into a few pieces, right? Probably the single biggest piece is we think that the lag between permits and starts is a bit longer. The cycle time is a little longer. You saw large builders pulling large quantity of permits and doing it to beat code changes, doing it to beat the rush. Everybody thought the market was going up. And they haven't put those starts in the ground as quickly as the traditional custom builders would have. And I think we all know the large nationals, the big guys are winning, right? They've got a bigger share of the pie. We think that's causing a little bit of distortion in the starts number, that, that will settle out as the year progresses. But at least early on, it overstated starts a bit. The other pieces are pieces we've talked about, right? Maybe another third of it is probably related to the pricing changes. A lot of that is vendor. Vendors have cut. We talked about EVP, Doors, Millwork. There are a bunch of categories that have had to readjust to the current demand and they have adjusted prices in response. So, that's an important piece. And another roughly third is in that category of mix, right? It's what we're seeing in terms of, if you think about the traditional good, better, best, you're talking about best to better, better to good, good to let's not do it. It's that things we were talking about before with regard to going from basement construction to slab may not sound like a big deal, but that percent is changing in the statistics and that has a meaningful decline in the value of product that goes into the house. So, rough categories, that's kind of how we think about it, but I'd be lying if I told you we had those numbers with precision. I think we've got good directionality, but we're going to have to see how that plays out. The interesting part of all of it, though, Mike, is it's so volatile, right? It moved quickly one way. There's no reason it can't move quickly the other. We're just going to stay close to it and make sure we're serving our customers the best we can. Good morning, Rafe. Thanks for the question. Yes, so the dynamic around the multi-family is a tricky one. We've tried to be really open and honest about what we're seeing, but it's not convenient in terms of how it's playing out. In other words, it didn't just stop on January 1st and we didn't have a nice clean turn. So, I don't have nice clean numbers last year or this year. So, there's a little bit of this you're probably going to poke at, but I can give you sort of my best sense of the directionality. We continue to see strong business in multi-family throughout all of last year that really began to turn in that Q1 window. We are seeing meaningful declines in our margins in what we're seeing starting in Q1 and stronger in Q2, kind of that 50 to a 100 basis points in those periods headwind driven by multi-family, right? That's sort of the combination of the mixed shift because it's all value-added and that downward shift within the category. So, with that in mind, we do expect it to continue this year. I think I mentioned from a dollar perspective, Q2 is going to be a chunky one, right? That was going to hurt a lot and obviously it did, but we will continue to see headwinds throughout the year. Again, with that kind of rough average of around 60 basis points, 50 to 70, give me a band around it based on timing, but overall impact on the company from the full multi-family segment of our business. Yes. Just to echo that same thought, we do stay very focused on making sure we're acting in a disciplined manner with our customers in key categories. As commodities, we pass it all through. A little color on that, I guess. I'm a bit disappointed. I would have hoped to have seen a lumber industry be a little more intentional about making money. Not everyone is a bad actor in that category, but I remain -- I continue to be surprised at how many players are willing to sustain loss or losing bills, business units, whatever you want to call it, longer than I would have expected. There's an awful lot of weeping and gnashing of the teeth out there, but not a lot of behavior that would indicate that we're moving in the right direction. Hopefully, we will, but that's disappointing. I think what you see are weaker lumber numbers that we absolutely pass through to our customers. What I was referring to before are certain price cuts that we've seen, specific actions taken by EWP players, Doors players, Millwork players, and some others where we've seen low to mid-single-digit reductions in overall sales attributable to nothing else than customer -- the prices we give our customers are adjusted because of the prices we're charged by our vendors. Good morning, Adam. Honestly, to know that answer with precision, I'd probably call you guys. We know there are data points that prove our point. What we don't have is confidence in the individual buckets. It's way too volatile and way too customer specific, regionally influenced for us. But again, if we're missing 20 points in terms of where is that sale, I think directionally, the biggest third is on the extended time, it's taking between permit and sale. We know another chunk of it is on the value, just the price is charged and the rest of it is that mix component. It's square footage. It's smaller. It's cheaper. Five to seven, I don't know. I'm guessing, to be honest. Yes, I 100% agree on digital. It is encouraging. The momentum is good. On M&A, the momentum is good there too. I think you've seen the increasing number of acquisition targets that we are closing on. Still little bit smaller, but we really like to pace. The pipeline still looks very good. We are still pleased with the potential targets out there. And, the way that negotiations are going. Certainly, very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the business in a healthy way with really, really nice assets like the ones we added this quarter. Thank you. ,: So, the second-half of the question, yes, our '26 is still intact. We would need volumes to rebound, but we feel good about the core business. And I think that informs where we are dialing in on the EBITDA number for that base business comp. We are getting better and better clarity around what our margin profile looks like in a healthy market, what our profile looks like in the current market, and being able to dial in the breakout from commodities kind of seeing the full-year really leveling out right around that 400 level without a ton of volatility, a bit, but not a ton is giving us the ability to dial it in a little bit more to what we think is a real sort of neutral commodity level or performance. Core business is still very healthy. As much as we wanted to be bigger, I think, what you're seeing here and what their base business chart lays out is a business that's really been transformed based on what we sell and how we service our customers, and the stability of that core business, even though you've seen kind of some ups and downs in the starts performance at the overall market. It's still in the range with how we buy our inventory, which is what we have always tried to do. As long as we have the ability to cover what we soiled, we are willing to work with our builders however we need to match that up, also, with how they priced their homes. And it hasn't gotten to the point where it was 90-plus or whatever. But we are generally in a 45-day exposure rate, but that's exactly how much inventory we hold and how we carry it. Well, and at that point, we actually do take market risk. I mean, what we are trying to do is mitigate their risk and mitigate our risk; we work with them to try to find that middle ground and make sure that they're covered and we are covered. And we'll adjust off of that, and touch markets specific if that solve the problem for our customer. But in general, we are in that 45-day range. Thanks, Reuben. We called it out in terms of what went through COGS. It was just basically zero, right, at 23 or whatever, small 3% headwind. That is something that does move a little out of sequence with what you see in random blanks. It is going to be a headwind in the second-half versus first-half, which is how you get to that sort of full-year number that's a little below the 400 level. Well, Jay, we always wanted to take all the shares about that comment. Now, in all honest and all sincerity, we always see a couple month lag, and if you think about the Q1 starts number, that was up in the 20s. So, you are just that swash over a little bit into Q2. We are seeing a comparable performance in the business. We will certainly see a graphic, like Dave said. We think when there're opportunities to lean in and take share, we are going to keep doing it. But that's not really the explanation, if you will. Thank you."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. \nDavid Rush: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Our resilient first quarter results reflect our differentiated product portfolio and scale, our team members consistent focus on executing our strategic priorities and our operational efficiency initiatives. As we expected, a weakening multifamily market and higher mortgage rates, driving affordability challenges were headwinds to start the year. Despite these micro challenges, we built on our successes and drove growth through our value-added products portfolio in our industry-leading digital platform. . \n We are committed to advancing innovation and delivering exceptional customer service as a trusted and preferred partner to our customers. We are focused on executing our clear strategic pillars, as shown on Slide 3. Our investments in value-added products, install services and digital solutions are driving organic growth, delivering greater efficiency and empowering the next generation of homebuilding. For those who are new to the BFS story, value-added products include manufactured components such as trusses, Ready-Frame and wall panels as well as windows, doors and millwork.  \n Through our value-added products and install services we help meet our customer needs, such as reducing cycle times, addressing labor constraints and improving home construction quality. With our digital tools, we are providing our customers with a more efficient and cost-effective way to manage the construction of their homes that will increase existing customer stickiness, win new business and improve our operational efficiency. We remain committed to innovation and continuously seeking to do things better.  \n We have a robust set of operational and productivity initiatives and are focused on leveraging our scale and fixed cost while delivering the highest quality products and services to our customers. We are deploying capital in a disciplined manner with a proven M&A strategy and a track record of buying back shares at competitive prices. Working alongside the best team in the industry, I am confident that we will continue to compound long-term shareholder value and achieve our strategic priorities.  \n Let's turn to our first quarter highlights on Slide 4. We continued to deliver strong margins in Q1, reflecting our end-segment diversification, focused execution and differentiated product portfolio and scale. Our gross margins of more than 33% reflect a higher mix of value-added products, including multifamily truss and our ability to manufacture more efficiently. We expect the multifamily end segment to progressively normalize over the course of this year, and we continue to see some normalization in core margins.  \n Moving to Slide 5.  We're off to a strong start on our strategic initiatives. Our full digital product launch at the International Builders' Show in February was an exciting milestone. At a high level, our digital tools do 3 things: one, solve customer pain points; two, make it even easier to partner with us and our suppliers; and three, help us gain incremental business from new and existing customers. It's a win-win, and we're excited about how everything is going so far after the launch.  \n We're focused on operational excellence and innovation and using playbooks of proven best practices to increase our safety, efficiency and wallet share with customers. One area where we're using playbooks is with our installed services business. Our install sales increased by 17% year-over-year as we leverage our capabilities to help customers address labor constraints. Additionally, we drove $40 million in productivity savings in Q1, primarily through procurement and SG&A initiatives. We believe prudent expense management leads to maximum operational flexibility. This includes optimizing our footprint and balancing cost reductions against future capacity demands.  \n We will remain disciplined managers of this discretionary spending no matter the operating environment. Early momentum in single-family has slowed as persistent inflation has cooled short-term expectations for interest rate reductions. However, low existing home inventories and pent-up demand provide an environment where growth has continued to build. Builders across the board are having to navigate affordability issues and challenges with the regulatory environment, land development and infrastructure.  \n It's evident that the large national builders have done a good job of utilizing specs, reducing home sizes and providing interest rate buydowns to assist buyers with affordable options. Smaller builders are more likely to benefit from rate cuts. We are staying in close contact with our customers of all sizes to maximize our business in the current environment. As we have detailed on prior calls, multifamily became a headwind in Q1 as our activity levels and record backlogs have declined versus the prior year.  \n It is important to note, however, that multifamily remains a strong contributor to gross margins and EBITDA even at current levels.  \n Turning to M&A on Slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In the first quarter, we completed 2 deals with aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $36 million. In early February, we acquired Quality Door and Millwork, a leading distributor of millwork, doors and windows in Southern Idaho.  \n In March, we acquired Hanson Truss, which further strengthens our value-added position in Northern California and Nevada. And last week, we acquired [ Schoeneman's Building Materials ]. [ Schoeneman's ] manufactures trusses and distributes building materials in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota area. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. M&A and organic investments have increased value-added products as a percent of our overall mix by 700 basis points over the past 2 years and by 1,000 basis points if you go back to 2019.  \n Our success with this strategy has been a core component of our improved margin profile through the cycle. We believe there is a long runway of M&A targets in our fragmented market, and we are pleased with recent improvements in the pipeline. Our disciplined approach to M&A includes increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions and enhancing customer retention.  \n On Slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter, we completed a $1 billion note offering which brought us additional financial flexibility to grow organically and remain acquisitive while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In addition to the 2 tuck-in acquisitions, we repurchased $20 million of shares as proven by our track record, we'll continue to buy back shares while allocating capital to high-return opportunities. We remain on track to strategically deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026 as outlined at Investor Day last December.  \n Now let's turn to Slides 8 and 9 for an update on our digital strategy. As the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space, we believe BFS digital tools will be transformative for the industry and a substantial driver of organic growth. Our easy-to-use portal myBLDR.com seamlessly delivers our full digital capabilities to our customers. It is designed to create efficiencies for our team members and improved service for our customers by offering increased transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. Combined with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, our customers will have more control over the entire building process. This will save time and money for both our customers and their clients while making the homebuilding process more personalized.  \n We were proud to highlight the full digital product capabilities at IBS in February. Our customers told us the new tools address an unmet need, and they were excited to use them in their businesses. Since launch in late February, we have seen orders on the digital platform go from nearly 0 to over $60 million. In Q1, we had incremental sales of over $10 million. We remain confident in our ability to meet our targets of $200 million of incremental digital revenue by the end of this year and $1 billion by 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers.  \n One of our digital tools, Build Optimize uses advanced 3D modeling to identify construction clashes and resolve mechanical design conflicts before breaking ground. It ensures architects, builders and trades are coordinated and building to the same plan. As a proof point of the advantages of using this transformative tool, we've seen interest from 4 large builders. One of these customers has used it in 3 markets and 13 communities across 34 plants. On average, we have identified 150 conflicts per plant, resolving those conflicts before construction leads to job site time and cost savings.  \n One of my favorite initiatives at BFS is acknowledging team members who go above and beyond. Ira Banks in Atlanta, Georgia personifies this quality. Ira began with BFS in 1996 as a driver helper and rose through the ranks to operations manager and now oversees our new Atlanta Millwork facility in Dacula. Ira has the respect of his team members because he's willing to do whatever it takes to solve problems and add value for our customers. Recently, when there was no available drivers for an urgent customer delivery that had to arrive that day, Ira drove the box truck himself to take care of the customer.  \n I'm grateful for Ira's drive to lead by example, a quality we find consistently in leaders across BFS. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail. \nPeter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy and operating model. We are maintaining our fortress balance sheet and prudently deploying capital to the highest return opportunities. We've included acquisitions and share repurchases during the quarter. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and value creation for our customers and shareholders.  \n I will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our 2024 guidance and related assumptions.  \n Let's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slides 10 and 11. We delivered $3.9 billion in net sales, driven by growth from acquisitions of 1.9% partially offset by commodity deflation of 1.7%. Core organic sales in line with the prior year were driven by a single-family increase of more than 4% amid higher sales of early-stage homebuilding products. From a geographic perspective, E sales were down mid-single digits, Central was flat and the West was up mid-teens. As we signaled and expected, multifamily declined more than 13% as we lapped the prior year's strong comps. R&R and other also declined by almost 5% due to weakness predominantly in the Northeast from inclement weather.  \n As we mentioned last quarter, inclement weather negatively impacted our operations in Q1 by roughly 3% to 4% of our overall sales. Value-added products represented approximately 52% of our net sales during the first quarter, reflecting our strength and customer stickiness for these higher-margin products. During the first quarter, gross profit was $1.3 billion, a decrease of approximately 5% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 33.4%, decreasing 190 basis points, mainly due to a timing shift in product mix towards lower-margin, early-stage homebuilding products, as well as margin normalization, particularly in multifamily.  \n SG&A increased $22 million to $926 million, primarily attributable to acquired operations. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 50 basis points to 23.8%. The team has done an excellent job managing SG&A, and we stand ready to leverage our fixed costs into the growing market. \n Adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, down approximately 14%, primarily driven by lower gross profit and higher operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.9%, down 240 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted net income of $327 million was down $83 million from the prior year due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses, primarily due to acquisitions. \n Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.65, a decrease of 11% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.29 per share for the first quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12.  Our Q1 operating cash flow was approximately $317 million, down $337 million compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to lower net income and an increase in net working capital.  \n Capital expenditures for the quarter were $90 million, and free cash flow was approximately $228 million. For the last 12 months ended March 31, our free cash flow yield was approximately 6%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 22%.  Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1x, while base business leverage was 1.2x. In February, we completed a $1 billion private offer of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2034, which enables a maximum financial flexibility to grow organically and remain acquisitive.  \n Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $2.4 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $700 million of cash on hand. \n Moving to capital deployment. During the first quarter, we repurchased roughly 100,000 shares for $20 million at an average stock price of $202.67 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August of '21, we have repurchased 42.2% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $70.42 per share for $6.1 billion.  \n We have $980 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns.  \n Now let's turn to our outlook, which we are reaffirming on Slide 13. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 14% to 15%, and we are guiding gross margins to a range of 30% to 33%, which is in line with our long-term normalized expectation. Our recent margins reflect above normal multifamily performance on top of our greater mix of value-added products along with the disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs.  \n We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per thousand board feet. Our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions and includes an expectation for improving single-family growth. Please refer to our earnings release in Slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions.  \n As you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance, but we wanted to provide directional color for Q2 given the ongoing interest rate uncertainty and the geopolitical situation.  On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q2 net sales to be down low single digits to flat as single-family growth is offset by expected multifamily headwinds. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be down high teens in Q2, primarily given the impact of continued multifamily normalization.  \n Turning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $17.6 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.4 billion at a margin of 13.5%.  \n As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create shareholder value in any environment. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts. \nDavid Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by summarizing how we're set up to drive long-term profitable growth by executing our strategic pillars. We believe we are the unquestioned leader in addressing our customers' pain points through our focus on customer service, value-added products and install services. Our industry-leading digital innovations are bringing greater efficiency to homebuilding and will win us new customers and grow wallet share along the way.  \n Our robust free cash flow generation is funding disciplined capital deployment that will maximize returns and compound long-term shareholder value. We have a proven playbook for growth during complex operating environments, and we'll keep working to be the best and deliver excellence every day. Thank you again for joining us today. \n Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And it does appear we have our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. \nMatthew Bouley: I'll start out on the second quarter. I'm wondering what's implied in the second quarter gross margin. It seems that you're kind of moving into that full year range of 30% to 33% in the second quarter, but correct me if I'm wrong. I know we're talking about normalization in both multifamily and the core, so within that second quarter gross margin, can we say that the over earn in both multifamily and the core is entirely rolled off or not yet entirely rolled off. So would there be sort of more to come beyond the second quarter? \nPeter Jackson: Matt, thanks for the question. So the margins that we're seeing are really in line with what we were expecting. The multifamily business specifically, I think, outlined it a couple of times, but for everybody just to restate it, will continue to normalize, will continue to go down over the course of the year. We think that sales will continue to decline back towards normal, and we'll continue to see margins as a percentage return back to normal as the year progresses. So not over, but very much in line with what we were expecting. \n Margins -- there's a couple of things going on. We've talked about margin normalization being between 30% and 33%. We think that's an accurate forecast. Just keep in mind that normalization in this instance, would assume normal starts which we're not quite back to yet. But that said, our guide for the year is still within that range. We've seen some good things hold on longer, and we think that's going to sustain us to be able to get to our guide for the year on margins. But it's performing about like we expected. It's not a surprise in terms of where the rates -- where the margin levels are. \nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Secondly, the multifamily revenue impact, clearly, it's quite concentrated in the manufacturing products. I see multifamily was down 13% in Q1. It looks like you have one more, I think, tough year-over-year comparison in multifamily here in the second quarter. So I guess within the second quarter guide, is the assumption that multifamily is down sort of more than it was in the first quarter. Would that imply that Q2 is sort of the low point for multifamily year-over-year with lesser declines in the second half? Or should we assume that we should look for kind of a consistent headwind for multifamily declines through the balance of the year? \nPeter Jackson: Yes, it's the latter. You should expect a consistent decline from multifamily throughout the year. It's a long lead time product category. We've got pretty good visibility to what we're expecting to see. There's certainly a bit of slippage from one month to the next in any given period. But I think what we're seeing and expecting in multifamily is another big decline in Q2 and sort of a consistent year-over-year decline throughout the end of the year.  We'll, of course, update you as we learn more. \nOperator: And we have our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. \nMichael Dahl: I want to ask, I guess, is effectively a follow-up there. When we think about what's implied for the second half, if we look at the 1Q results and 2Q, directional color, at the midpoint, it requires double-digit top line growth and kind of 15% EBITDA margins. And the high end would be kind of like mid-teens top line growth and 16% EBITDA margin, both of those, just given the multifamily decline, your comments just now about further normalization in gross margin. It kind of seems difficult. So maybe you can help us there. I guess it's a roundabout way of asking more directly. When you look at the full year guide, is there a point in the range that you think you're leaning more towards at this point, like midpoint or lower or midpoint or higher. Maybe just help us understand how that's evolved. \nPeter Jackson: Mike, thanks for the question. In short, we're really confident in the forecast, the way it's laid out. That guide is something that you put out there and feel good about reaffirming. The growth that you're talking about is already happening. So I think it came through in some of our materials. I think there's maybe this expectation that our whole business moves in the same way in the same quarter. And that's really not what we're seeing here, right? You're seeing the early parts of the building process, the lumber, the truss, the stuff that hits the job site early after the start, doing great. we're growing. The momentum is building. \n There are certainly some headwinds we're dealing with. I mean we talked a little bit about that. I'm sure we'll talk more. But the business is performing very well in that category. We've not yet started to see the tailwind, the uplift from some of the later building process products, right, the doors, the millwork, they are also good for us. But we have every confidence that that's coming, that that's going to continue to be a good tailwind for us. There are, of course, a lot of questions about what the overall market in single family is going to do, a lot of questions about interest rates. \n But again, let's not forget, there's a lot of demand out there. There are a lot of confident homebuilders. There are a lot of good units and good production momentum going on, and we're participating. So we're not concerned about delivering based on everything we're seeing today, but we do have to digest multifamily. I think we've been very transparent about that. It's working like we expected, and things are playing out. So yes, the back half of the year needs to be growing. But again, we're seeing good momentum that we think will pass through on the early-stage products. We're seeing good growth in categories that we've leaned into, value-add, install, and we continue to be active in M&A. \n So certainly, a lot to be confident in. We're happy with the business and not shy about what we're seeing for the rest of the year. \nDavid Rush: Yes. The only thing I'd add is -- echo  the overarching demand profile continues to be strong. I think the timing of when they actually execute the buy is kind of what is a little more volatile than the expectation that they will execute the buy. And that's part of it but our builder customers are still indicating that they are seeing that demand, and they're expecting the similar trajectory that we've forecasted for ourselves for the back half. \nMichael Dahl: Okay. Got it. And then shifting gears just to capital deployment and maybe specifically the buyback. I mean you've got plenty of liquidity. Your leverage is low. The buyback was really just nominal this quarter for the first time in a while. What can we take away from that? And maybe anything more specific about how you envision deploying capital through the year? \nPeter Jackson: Yes. We're -- you're right, we're sitting on about $700 million in cash plus all of the capacity in the ABL, lots of cool M&A popping, right? I mean we've done a couple of small deals so far, but we're sitting on a bunch of dry powder and excited about what the opportunities look like. We'll have to see how they play out. But at this moment in time, we're ready to take advantage of the opportunities that are going to present themselves. That's kind of how you should read that. A little bit of a slow start to the year, but we're feeling good. \nOperator: And we have our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens. \nTrey Grooms: I also want to touch on the guidance, believe it or not. You guys mentioned -- well, first off, you reiterated the full year, you mentioned that multifamily is going about as you expected. And clearly, you guys have been very vocal about your expectations and kind of the pullback there in multifamily and the impact it could have. But clearly, the 2Q guide is lower than what I think most were kind of modeling or expecting, but with you reiterating the full year guide, is it fair to say that kind of overall, the 2Q is kind of tracking as you would have thought? Any surprises there?  Or maybe even any areas where it's coming in better or worse than you would have expected as we've moved so far through the year? \nDavid Rush: Yes. Thanks, Trey. What I would tell you is multifamily in specific, some of that backlog is getting extended. So where at one point in time in the year, I may have thought more of those jobs would finish quicker. They're spread now. It's actually a good thing. It kind of smoothed that transition for us in one way. The other thing I'd tell you about multifamily, our team has done a great job going after pseudo multifamily. \n Smaller multifamily projects, customers, they [ haven't ] typically gone after that are helping also transition that hasn't started yet, but we're seeing a lot of good momentum in that space, things like assisted living versus a 4-level apartment complex. So smaller jobs as you take them by themselves, but add it up, it will help the transition.\n But single family is kind of operating the way we expected it to. There's been --  it's never retracted below a level. It's a build, and it's a continual build, but at the end of the day, is it as steep of a build as we would like? Of course, not, it's not as robust as we would like ever, but it's steady and it's there, and it doesn't retract. That's an important factor. It is a build even as it's a slower build than we'd love to see. And we're adjusting that as we need to, to those market conditions. \nPeter Jackson: The only thing I might add is there's nothing in what's happened that is a surprise to us in terms of the variables. All the variables I think. We've accounted for. There are a couple of variables that were, I would say, bigger headwinds than we anticipated. I think that weather thing has certainly thrown us a curve ball. It will bounce back, but that's been a tricky one to navigate, particularly regionally. \n I think what builders have done to build homes more affordably, whether it be size of the home or complexity of the home there's some variability on that as well that we've been challenged with. But again, I think we're in line. We're doing what we said we were going to do despite those variables. \nDavid Rush: Yes. And I would add, a good indicator for me is always our truss backlog. Our truss backlog is at healthy levels. It's continuing to build. That's an indicator for us of what's to come. And that -- if that was starting to slack off, I might give a little more worried, but it's where it needs to be for us to be in a healthy situation. \nTrey Grooms: Got it. All right. Well, I appreciate it. And hearing that you're very confident in the guide and being able to reiterate it is encouraging. So -- we appreciate it, and thanks. Good luck for the rest of the quarter. \nPeter Jackson: Thanks, Trey. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. \nRafe Jadrosich: I wanted to ask on the commodity pricing. In the first quarter, it was deflationary, but when you look at -- I think OSB prices were up, lumber prices seemed kind of flattish sequentially. So can you just talk about what you're seeing there either is it from a mix standpoint? Or how does the competitive environment evolve? And like how do you expect that to go going forward? \nPeter Jackson: Yes. So I would tell you right up front that commodities are where the war is happening. That's where the fight is. It's where historically, you've got the most aggressive players. You've got the most dynamic pricing, the volatility of it. I think what you're seeing in the numbers is really just around timing. A little bit of shift in terms of when we saw the OSB run versus when we were feeling it. That will come through at different points during the year. But I would expect sort of us to be pretty much done with the bad news around the prices of commodities. \n What I will say, though, is while we saw the run in OSB that's starting to walk back. We saw a much smaller run on lumber and that's walking back as well. So I think you're seeing that mood of the market recognizing [ higher ] for longer and trying to triangulate on what that means to commodity prices. But again, that's not our game. We don't play the commodities up, commodity down bet. We're continuing to on product just in time, move it quickly, price appropriately, get paid for what we do, that our strategy hasn't changed at all in that category. \nRafe Jadrosich: Got it. Very helpful. And then just on SG&A, there was some deleverage in the first quarter. How should we think about that going forward here, especially if sales turn in the second half of the year? And then just remind us of the base in terms of incentive comp from last year, do you have an easier comparison there and how we just about leverage versus what you have done historically? \nPeter Jackson: Yes. So SG&A, we saw a couple of one-timers come through in Q1 that hurt us a little bit. Some of it was -- we had some credits last year that we didn't repeat this year. I wouldn't -- from my perspective and take it what it's worth, I wouldn't read too much into it.\n I think our consistent discipline around expenses will keep us in the ranges that you'd expect.  Summer months are always our best leverage months, right, Q2, Q3, so you'll see that come through. In terms of the base business, I guess I would say there isn't much of an adjustment, maybe minor on the bonus side.\n I think really the storyline around the year-over-year bonuses is that we gave ourselves as you've seen a more challenging target and plan for this year. Our performance is more in line versus vastly outperforming that target. So you will see a pullback in the total amount of bonus dollars just by nature of that performance, which you'd expect. I think that shareholders, management and the Board is all an alignment on that one. So that will be a bit of a tailwind versus the prior year just from a dollar amount perspective. \nDavid Rush: The only thing I'd add is our highest variable cost obviously is our labor. And the field and the team have done an exceptional job keeping labor as a percent of gross profit, which is our key metric, right in line with our operating -- within the parameters of what we set for ourselves in this level of sales and activity and our tools for managing that cost are as good as they've ever been in my 25 years with the company. So the key factor for us in managing SG&A is how well we manage our labor down at the field level, and they've done exceptional at that since the beginning of the year. \nOperator: And we have our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist. \nKeith Hughes: The question on the windows and doors segment. It was down 2%. You talked about some product costs declining. Can you talk about that a little bit more, which product and is that selling prices declining or inputs, any kind of details would be great. \nDavid Rush: Well, good morning, Keith, if you recall, Keith, this time last year or in the first quarter last year, we were just coming out of normalization of the supply chain, windows and doors were getting delivered timely again, and the national builders focus on completions in that first quarter was at a higher level just to catch up. That kind of was the [ PIG in the pipeline ] for us last year in higher millwork and [ window and ] the door sales in the first quarter than normal. I would tell you this first quarter was normal. So we had to roll over those numbers from last year where it was a bit more tilted towards completions where this year was more normal with respect to completions. \n There has been some deflation in the category, and specifically, I think, with millwork -- on the millwork side. And that's affected it modestly. I think we saw pretty close. Our volumes did exactly what we expected our volumes to do and it was more along the lines of some of the deflationary impact along with rolling over that higher degree of completions last first quarter, that really explained the difference. \nOperator: And we have our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. \nAdam Baumgarten: Can you talk about what you're seeing from a non-commodity pricing perspective? And maybe specifically on the manufactured product side? \nDavid Rush: So you're talking about customer pricing or vendor pricing. \nAdam Baumgarten: Your pricing to customers. \nDavid Rush: So it's -- as you would expect and why we play in those categories, that is less price sensitive on the manufacturing side because once you get locked in with the designer and you get locked in with somebody who's going to meet delivery schedules and whatnot. That becomes more important factor. Now as commodities have fluctuated and the fact that they are a component of manufacturing that affects the price as commodities go up or down, and they've been going down for lumber slightly. \n But you know what we've been able to do is offset some of that with our efficiencies that we've been able to gain throughout since the merger with our automation investments and our continual improvement in actual board foot per labor hour produced has been a nice offset to some of those challenges. But as a whole, value add continues to hold in there better than commodities, which, of course, is in line with our strategy. \nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the 3% to 4% impact from weather you saw in 1Q, how should we expect that to be recouped? Is it mostly in 2Q? Or is it going to span over a few quarters? \nPeter Jackson: Well, I was happy to say Q2 up until Houston got buried or flooded out. Generally, it takes about quarter to a quarter and a half to catch back up. It doesn't unfortunately just whipsaw back the other direction, but that's probably a reasonable way to think about it, 3 to 4 months. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. \nStanley Elliott: can you all talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the services piece, some very strong numbers, up 17%. Is this kind of reflection of your efforts to take it into new markets. Is this existing your -- more services with some of your existing customers. And then I guess secondly, how should we eventually take it up -- this as either attach rate or pull through on some of the other things you're doing on the manufactured side? \nDavid Rush: Yes. I would say all of the above. We had a strong install business. We did $2.5 billion in labor and materials installed in 2023. So we had a nice base to work from. And our initial focus, as you would expect, was on the products that we are already good at in one market and leveraging that platform to other markets. And it's the products that we're most familiar with and the products that we distribute every day. So we've got off to a great start. A lot of that increase is from existing markets that are already doing install because those are the ones that had the base to work from. \n But we developed really nice playbooks, and we've had really good interest, which has been pull interest. So as people reaching out, I want to get into this business, how do I do it the right way versus us saying, \"Hey, you need to get into this business.\" Which is in my role, in my seat, that's what you want to see. And we've got really good people, really good plans, and we just think it's the next evolution for us as a company in solving our customer pain points and doing it methodically and in a way that we don't make mistakes. That's key for me, to do it the right way and make sure that what we are generating is customer value added solutions. \nStanley Elliott: And curious kind of tagging on that, if you're willing to share. Are you seeing more of this uptake with some of the smaller builders, some of the more national builders? Just trying to kind of get a sense for the flavor there? \nDavid Rush: It's a little, it depends on the product category first of all. But the national builders certainly like the install solution wherever they can apply it. \n The custom guys like it, but they're a little more specific to millwork or a little more specific to install windows probably not so much installed framing, right? So it's a really good play for the national builders. They seem to like that the best, but there are applications for both segments. \nPeter Jackson: And to Dave's point, we do see a higher level of adoption of our value-added products to the larger players just generally. \nDavid Rush: Yes. And install is a natural evolution to the value add. It's the next part of value add, not only do you get the components delivered to the job site, but you actually install the components that are delivered to the job site, that's just a natural evolution of doing more for our customers. \nOperator: And we have our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies. \nCollin Verron: I just want to start on the gross margin side of things. You talked about the shift in timing towards early-stage homebuilding products being a gross margin mix headwind. Can you maybe quantify that headwind either sequentially or year-over-year? And how it compares to the headwind you're seeing from multifamily normalization? And just following up on that, how you're thinking about that mix through the rest of the year, just given what you're seeing in starts, backlogs and conversations with your customers? \nPeter Jackson: Yes. So I don't think I can give you the detail -- thank you for the question. I'm not sure I can give you the breakdown necessarily exactly what you're looking for. What I can tell you is on the mix side, it's an expectation that we're going to see a trend back to normal mix. I don't think that's much of a stretch, right? So what we're seeing right now is more of our growth being in the pure commodities and the truss and the relationship between just those 2 categories, biases it towards the commodities. And commodities like I was saying before, is where we've had the most aggressive normalization. \n We've seen it across the board on the gross margins, right? We've seen gross margin normalization. We've talked about it a lot. It's not just multifamily, it's single-family, too. Matter of fact, this quarter, the bulk of it was single-family normalization. Much of that is the mix, but a good chunk of that is also just what we've been messaging over the last year, and that's -- we have seen this normalization play out. We've seen it across the business. And this year's margins are when you peel back that multifamily stuff, a step down from where they were. That was why we were so adamant last year that our mid-30s gross margin numbers weren't going to hold on because we were seeing it play out. \n But that mix will certainly be a tailwind as we regain the later-stage building products, but we have, again, the lapping from the prior year. So that's why our guide is in that 30% to 33% range because we think that those 3 variables will play against each other, and we want to try and give you the best insight possible to where we'll end up. \nCollin Verron: Okay. That's helpful color. I guess I want to pivot towards the M&A pipeline. It sounds like it's pretty robust. Any color to the size of potential deals out there in the market and what those potential targets look like from a product offering perspective. \nPeter Jackson: We won't get that precise, but I think our strategy has not changed, right? The way we look at the market, where we're successful, where we can add the most value are all variables in the discussion. But I think that there's -- there are always a million rumors about what may or may not trade. I think for us, it's imperative that we stay disciplined and we stay focused. What's exciting is, as it stands today, we see a lot of assets out there that fit that screen, and now we just got to see if we can get them across finish line. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Tyler Batory with Oppenheimer. \nTyler Batory: A question on the competitive environment. Are you seeing some of the smaller players out there may be trying to get more aggressive to take market shares. Is that having an impact on your performance and on your business? \nDavid Rush: What I would tell you, Tyler, is not any more than usual. Again, where we differentiate ourselves is in the value-added solution in the value-added space, and that's for a reason. Anybody can do commodities, anybody can deliver lumber. It's hard to differentiate yourself in a straight distribution model. So we do see competition in that arena for sure. We try to leverage our relationships with those customers where we do other stuff for them very well and use that as a way to continue to maintain share on the commodity side versus just getting into a price war. \n So we do see competition in that regard. We choose to compete where we want to compete in that regard. But we'll always do a high percentage of lumber. We're good at doing lumber. We're good at meeting schedules and making sure the lumber is there when the customer wants it. And we get recognized for that and where we get that recognition is where we play. But in short, a lot more competition on the commodity side than the noncommodity side and our reputation on the value-added space carries us a long way. \nPeter Jackson: The only thing I'll add, I think it might be embedded in your question is share. I think one of the variables that we struggle with is what's the real share number. Generally, we would use single-family starts as a proxy for the market and then we would compare our sales against that. In general, that's a really tricky thing right now because I think there are some meaningful differences between a start unit and a sales dollar. \n Homes are smaller. The cost of those homes and what's being put into them and simpler and cheaper. And we have seen some not insignificant cost reductions or pricing reductions in terms of what we are getting from our vendors and what is selling into the market. Whether it be commodities which is the obvious one, but also EWP or millwork or any of the other ones we've talked about, those all represent sort of gaps or deltas between those 2 units of measure. \n And then you layer on a little bit of the timing related stuff, whether it be how complete these homes are and what we're selling or the weather or whatever, it certainly has made that whole discussion and that analysis really challenging. But back to Dave's point, I think the only place we think we've maybe struggled or battled is in that commodity, the low end where smaller competitors are more willing to get down and dirty. \nTyler Batory: Okay. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on the R&R side of things, down 5% in the quarter. I think weather probably impacting that. What are you seeing here in the second quarter, and there are a lot of differing views on the R&R end market out there? Just share your confidence in terms of your growth outlook this year in that end market. \nPeter Jackson: So as it relates specifically to the first quarter, we're higher concentrated in R&R in the Northeast. And the Northeast was that set area of the country for us. That was a great -- more greatly impacted by weather. I think 20 to 23 days had serious weather in the quarter. That's where we felt it. In general, I think R&R will be -- is kind of a two-edged sword, right? The bigger projects are facing some of the same kind of cost of money pressures that the small custom builder is facing. But the regular smaller projects, I think, are going to be along the same line as what you would expect. \nOperator: And we have our next question from David Manthey with Baird. \nDavid Manthey: My first question is on the digital. So the revenue uptick is good to see. Could you share with us any data on the number of net users today versus a year ago or the end of last year? Just to give us an idea of how that's ramping? And then is there any prototypical customer type that's implementing the system? Or is it just based on personality and choice? \nPeter Jackson: Dave, yes, we're excited about digital. I don't unfortunately have user numbers. I might be able to get them for you, but I don't have them off the top of my head. It's going up. We're seeing that. They were -- gosh, I don't know what it was 500 or 700 leads that we took out of IBS. We've got a lot of customers as we do our adoption and our rollout around the country that are coming on board. While most of them are mid to smaller-sized builders. The profile, I think, that you're talking about are those that are leaning into digital and technology to be able to make themselves more efficient and more professional and better with their customers. \n I think you've got -- sometimes it's generational. Candidly, sometimes it's not. It's just the mentality around leveraging tools to take waste out of the job, make the job go quicker, connect with the home buyer a little bit more easily, more visually. But it's such a -- in our opinion, it's such a compelling tool. \n It's got so much that can help to build or just get a little bit better every day. That game we're all trying to play, creating efficiency, making it more transparent to the builder, to the trades and to the home buyer. So that -- those are the types of customers, the ones that really take advantage of technology to do that, that we're seeing early. But in general, I think our digital tool has become -- is increasingly becoming the new way of doing business just because it's so easy. It's very modern, it's very smooth. And so far, so good. We're excited about the ramp-up trend and how it's been progressing, so far early days. \nDavid Rush: What I would tell you juices me the most was the traffic we had at our booth at IBS. I have never in my 25 years of going to IBS seen the kind of excitement and the kind of traffic that went through our booth, primarily because of our digital platform and showing what capabilities that it was going to present. The other  thing I would say is, think about it, if you're a smaller builder, 50 to 200 homes a year, you don't have the ability to invest in technology for yourself to get this to the level of platform that we're developing. \n What we're doing is leveraging our ability to make those investments develop that platform for our customers of that size so that they can play in that space and be efficient without having to make a huge upfront investment themselves. So that's the rationale behind why we developed it and why we think it will be appealing to our customer base and if IBS is any indication, we hit it right on the head. \nDavid Manthey: Okay. In the interest of time, I'll just pass it on. Thank you. \nOperator: And we have our next question from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. \nJames McCanless: So my first question, Peter, I think you called out some pretty positive sales trends for the Western U.S. Could you talk about how that's trended in April and May, similar pattern to what you saw in 1Q? \nPeter Jackson: Yes, pretty similar. I think that the West got hammered out of the gate, and they bounced back really nicely, a little more stable through the other 2 regions. But yes, I think that's been pretty consistent. We have to see how this whole weather thing in Houston plays out. But for the time being, it's pretty good. \nJames McCanless: Okay. And then taking the lumber question, especially some of the more commodity goods a step further. Is this a function of not only higher mortgage rates, but was there an oversupply of commodity lumber in the system to start the year? Just wondering if this is all rate-driven, if there's some other mitigating factors we need to be monitoring? \nPeter Jackson: We didn't see a lot of unusual behavior in the market, no. Tough for us to see that from others perspective, but it's a strong I would think generally a strong and a stable market. So I don't know how people made bets with regard to where stuff was moving. \nOperator: And we have our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. \nKetan Mamtora: Peter, just one question. You've talked quite a bit about margin normalization and multifamily. On the core organic, the single-family piece, do you think at this point, we are sort of towards the end of that normalization, midway through? How would you characterize that? And are the competitive dynamics in that side of the business changing at all, given sort of pressure on EWP prices, given where lumber is today. Just curious to get your thoughts. \nPeter Jackson: Ketan, yes, I would tell you that we're closer to the end in terms of how we expect margins to normalize. We're still below normal in terms of volume. So that's a pressure-filled environment. It's always very competitive. It always has been. We expect it always will be on the commodity side. But that now needs to be a battle cry that we rise to, right? And it's something that we've done for years and we feel good about. \n There's a -- there's an expectation that the little player will always be more competitive, and we think that will continue to play out. But by and large, I think margins have performed well. There's certainly been some aggressiveness from certain vendors, but in most cases, it's in response to past moves. So more of a normalization, more of a rebound back -- a mean reversion, if you will, rather than a, oh, we're in trouble, we need to do something dramatic. Does that make sense? \nKetan Mamtora: It does. Thank you very much. \nOperator: And it appears we have reached our allotted time for the question-and-answer session today. That will conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy and operating model. We are maintaining our fortress balance sheet and prudently deploying capital to the highest return opportunities. We've included acquisitions and share repurchases during the quarter. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and value creation for our customers and shareholders.  \n I will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our 2024 guidance and related assumptions.  \n Let's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slides 10 and 11. We delivered $3.9 billion in net sales, driven by growth from acquisitions of 1.9% partially offset by commodity deflation of 1.7%. Core organic sales in line with the prior year were driven by a single-family increase of more than 4% amid higher sales of early-stage homebuilding products. From a geographic perspective, E sales were down mid-single digits, Central was flat and the West was up mid-teens. As we signaled and expected, multifamily declined more than 13% as we lapped the prior year's strong comps. R&R and other also declined by almost 5% due to weakness predominantly in the Northeast from inclement weather.  \n As we mentioned last quarter, inclement weather negatively impacted our operations in Q1 by roughly 3% to 4% of our overall sales. Value-added products represented approximately 52% of our net sales during the first quarter, reflecting our strength and customer stickiness for these higher-margin products. During the first quarter, gross profit was $1.3 billion, a decrease of approximately 5% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 33.4%, decreasing 190 basis points, mainly due to a timing shift in product mix towards lower-margin, early-stage homebuilding products, as well as margin normalization, particularly in multifamily.  \n SG&A increased $22 million to $926 million, primarily attributable to acquired operations. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 50 basis points to 23.8%. The team has done an excellent job managing SG&A, and we stand ready to leverage our fixed costs into the growing market. \n Adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, down approximately 14%, primarily driven by lower gross profit and higher operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.9%, down 240 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted net income of $327 million was down $83 million from the prior year due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses, primarily due to acquisitions. \n Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.65, a decrease of 11% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.29 per share for the first quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12.  Our Q1 operating cash flow was approximately $317 million, down $337 million compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to lower net income and an increase in net working capital.  \n Capital expenditures for the quarter were $90 million, and free cash flow was approximately $228 million. For the last 12 months ended March 31, our free cash flow yield was approximately 6%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 22%.  Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1x, while base business leverage was 1.2x. In February, we completed a $1 billion private offer of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2034, which enables a maximum financial flexibility to grow organically and remain acquisitive.  \n Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $2.4 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $700 million of cash on hand. \n Moving to capital deployment. During the first quarter, we repurchased roughly 100,000 shares for $20 million at an average stock price of $202.67 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August of '21, we have repurchased 42.2% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $70.42 per share for $6.1 billion.  \n We have $980 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns.  \n Now let's turn to our outlook, which we are reaffirming on Slide 13. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 14% to 15%, and we are guiding gross margins to a range of 30% to 33%, which is in line with our long-term normalized expectation. Our recent margins reflect above normal multifamily performance on top of our greater mix of value-added products along with the disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs.  \n We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per thousand board feet. Our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions and includes an expectation for improving single-family growth. Please refer to our earnings release in Slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions.  \n As you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance, but we wanted to provide directional color for Q2 given the ongoing interest rate uncertainty and the geopolitical situation.  On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q2 net sales to be down low single digits to flat as single-family growth is offset by expected multifamily headwinds. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be down high teens in Q2, primarily given the impact of continued multifamily normalization.  \n Turning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $17.6 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.4 billion at a margin of 13.5%.  \n As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create shareholder value in any environment. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts. Matt, thanks for the question. So the margins that we're seeing are really in line with what we were expecting. The multifamily business specifically, I think, outlined it a couple of times, but for everybody just to restate it, will continue to normalize, will continue to go down over the course of the year. We think that sales will continue to decline back towards normal, and we'll continue to see margins as a percentage return back to normal as the year progresses. So not over, but very much in line with what we were expecting. \n Margins -- there's a couple of things going on. We've talked about margin normalization being between 30% and 33%. We think that's an accurate forecast. Just keep in mind that normalization in this instance, would assume normal starts which we're not quite back to yet. But that said, our guide for the year is still within that range. We've seen some good things hold on longer, and we think that's going to sustain us to be able to get to our guide for the year on margins. But it's performing about like we expected. It's not a surprise in terms of where the rates -- where the margin levels are. Yes, it's the latter. You should expect a consistent decline from multifamily throughout the year. It's a long lead time product category. We've got pretty good visibility to what we're expecting to see. There's certainly a bit of slippage from one month to the next in any given period. But I think what we're seeing and expecting in multifamily is another big decline in Q2 and sort of a consistent year-over-year decline throughout the end of the year.  We'll, of course, update you as we learn more. Mike, thanks for the question. In short, we're really confident in the forecast, the way it's laid out. That guide is something that you put out there and feel good about reaffirming. The growth that you're talking about is already happening. So I think it came through in some of our materials. I think there's maybe this expectation that our whole business moves in the same way in the same quarter. And that's really not what we're seeing here, right? You're seeing the early parts of the building process, the lumber, the truss, the stuff that hits the job site early after the start, doing great. we're growing. The momentum is building. \n There are certainly some headwinds we're dealing with. I mean we talked a little bit about that. I'm sure we'll talk more. But the business is performing very well in that category. We've not yet started to see the tailwind, the uplift from some of the later building process products, right, the doors, the millwork, they are also good for us. But we have every confidence that that's coming, that that's going to continue to be a good tailwind for us. There are, of course, a lot of questions about what the overall market in single family is going to do, a lot of questions about interest rates. \n But again, let's not forget, there's a lot of demand out there. There are a lot of confident homebuilders. There are a lot of good units and good production momentum going on, and we're participating. So we're not concerned about delivering based on everything we're seeing today, but we do have to digest multifamily. I think we've been very transparent about that. It's working like we expected, and things are playing out. So yes, the back half of the year needs to be growing. But again, we're seeing good momentum that we think will pass through on the early-stage products. We're seeing good growth in categories that we've leaned into, value-add, install, and we continue to be active in M&A. \n So certainly, a lot to be confident in. We're happy with the business and not shy about what we're seeing for the rest of the year. Yes. We're -- you're right, we're sitting on about $700 million in cash plus all of the capacity in the ABL, lots of cool M&A popping, right? I mean we've done a couple of small deals so far, but we're sitting on a bunch of dry powder and excited about what the opportunities look like. We'll have to see how they play out. But at this moment in time, we're ready to take advantage of the opportunities that are going to present themselves. That's kind of how you should read that. A little bit of a slow start to the year, but we're feeling good. The only thing I might add is there's nothing in what's happened that is a surprise to us in terms of the variables. All the variables I think. We've accounted for. There are a couple of variables that were, I would say, bigger headwinds than we anticipated. I think that weather thing has certainly thrown us a curve ball. It will bounce back, but that's been a tricky one to navigate, particularly regionally. \n I think what builders have done to build homes more affordably, whether it be size of the home or complexity of the home there's some variability on that as well that we've been challenged with. But again, I think we're in line. We're doing what we said we were going to do despite those variables. Thanks, Trey. Yes. So I would tell you right up front that commodities are where the war is happening. That's where the fight is. It's where historically, you've got the most aggressive players. You've got the most dynamic pricing, the volatility of it. I think what you're seeing in the numbers is really just around timing. A little bit of shift in terms of when we saw the OSB run versus when we were feeling it. That will come through at different points during the year. But I would expect sort of us to be pretty much done with the bad news around the prices of commodities. \n What I will say, though, is while we saw the run in OSB that's starting to walk back. We saw a much smaller run on lumber and that's walking back as well. So I think you're seeing that mood of the market recognizing [ higher ] for longer and trying to triangulate on what that means to commodity prices. But again, that's not our game. We don't play the commodities up, commodity down bet. We're continuing to on product just in time, move it quickly, price appropriately, get paid for what we do, that our strategy hasn't changed at all in that category. Yes. So SG&A, we saw a couple of one-timers come through in Q1 that hurt us a little bit. Some of it was -- we had some credits last year that we didn't repeat this year. I wouldn't -- from my perspective and take it what it's worth, I wouldn't read too much into it.\n I think our consistent discipline around expenses will keep us in the ranges that you'd expect.  Summer months are always our best leverage months, right, Q2, Q3, so you'll see that come through. In terms of the base business, I guess I would say there isn't much of an adjustment, maybe minor on the bonus side.\n I think really the storyline around the year-over-year bonuses is that we gave ourselves as you've seen a more challenging target and plan for this year. Our performance is more in line versus vastly outperforming that target. So you will see a pullback in the total amount of bonus dollars just by nature of that performance, which you'd expect. I think that shareholders, management and the Board is all an alignment on that one. So that will be a bit of a tailwind versus the prior year just from a dollar amount perspective. Well, I was happy to say Q2 up until Houston got buried or flooded out. Generally, it takes about quarter to a quarter and a half to catch back up. It doesn't unfortunately just whipsaw back the other direction, but that's probably a reasonable way to think about it, 3 to 4 months. And to Dave's point, we do see a higher level of adoption of our value-added products to the larger players just generally. Yes. So I don't think I can give you the detail -- thank you for the question. I'm not sure I can give you the breakdown necessarily exactly what you're looking for. What I can tell you is on the mix side, it's an expectation that we're going to see a trend back to normal mix. I don't think that's much of a stretch, right? So what we're seeing right now is more of our growth being in the pure commodities and the truss and the relationship between just those 2 categories, biases it towards the commodities. And commodities like I was saying before, is where we've had the most aggressive normalization. \n We've seen it across the board on the gross margins, right? We've seen gross margin normalization. We've talked about it a lot. It's not just multifamily, it's single-family, too. Matter of fact, this quarter, the bulk of it was single-family normalization. Much of that is the mix, but a good chunk of that is also just what we've been messaging over the last year, and that's -- we have seen this normalization play out. We've seen it across the business. And this year's margins are when you peel back that multifamily stuff, a step down from where they were. That was why we were so adamant last year that our mid-30s gross margin numbers weren't going to hold on because we were seeing it play out. \n But that mix will certainly be a tailwind as we regain the later-stage building products, but we have, again, the lapping from the prior year. So that's why our guide is in that 30% to 33% range because we think that those 3 variables will play against each other, and we want to try and give you the best insight possible to where we'll end up. We won't get that precise, but I think our strategy has not changed, right? The way we look at the market, where we're successful, where we can add the most value are all variables in the discussion. But I think that there's -- there are always a million rumors about what may or may not trade. I think for us, it's imperative that we stay disciplined and we stay focused. What's exciting is, as it stands today, we see a lot of assets out there that fit that screen, and now we just got to see if we can get them across finish line. The only thing I'll add, I think it might be embedded in your question is share. I think one of the variables that we struggle with is what's the real share number. Generally, we would use single-family starts as a proxy for the market and then we would compare our sales against that. In general, that's a really tricky thing right now because I think there are some meaningful differences between a start unit and a sales dollar. \n Homes are smaller. The cost of those homes and what's being put into them and simpler and cheaper. And we have seen some not insignificant cost reductions or pricing reductions in terms of what we are getting from our vendors and what is selling into the market. Whether it be commodities which is the obvious one, but also EWP or millwork or any of the other ones we've talked about, those all represent sort of gaps or deltas between those 2 units of measure. \n And then you layer on a little bit of the timing related stuff, whether it be how complete these homes are and what we're selling or the weather or whatever, it certainly has made that whole discussion and that analysis really challenging. But back to Dave's point, I think the only place we think we've maybe struggled or battled is in that commodity, the low end where smaller competitors are more willing to get down and dirty. So as it relates specifically to the first quarter, we're higher concentrated in R&R in the Northeast. And the Northeast was that set area of the country for us. That was a great -- more greatly impacted by weather. I think 20 to 23 days had serious weather in the quarter. That's where we felt it. In general, I think R&R will be -- is kind of a two-edged sword, right? The bigger projects are facing some of the same kind of cost of money pressures that the small custom builder is facing. But the regular smaller projects, I think, are going to be along the same line as what you would expect. Dave, yes, we're excited about digital. I don't unfortunately have user numbers. I might be able to get them for you, but I don't have them off the top of my head. It's going up. We're seeing that. They were -- gosh, I don't know what it was 500 or 700 leads that we took out of IBS. We've got a lot of customers as we do our adoption and our rollout around the country that are coming on board. While most of them are mid to smaller-sized builders. The profile, I think, that you're talking about are those that are leaning into digital and technology to be able to make themselves more efficient and more professional and better with their customers. \n I think you've got -- sometimes it's generational. Candidly, sometimes it's not. It's just the mentality around leveraging tools to take waste out of the job, make the job go quicker, connect with the home buyer a little bit more easily, more visually. But it's such a -- in our opinion, it's such a compelling tool. \n It's got so much that can help to build or just get a little bit better every day. That game we're all trying to play, creating efficiency, making it more transparent to the builder, to the trades and to the home buyer. So that -- those are the types of customers, the ones that really take advantage of technology to do that, that we're seeing early. But in general, I think our digital tool has become -- is increasingly becoming the new way of doing business just because it's so easy. It's very modern, it's very smooth. And so far, so good. We're excited about the ramp-up trend and how it's been progressing, so far early days. Yes, pretty similar. I think that the West got hammered out of the gate, and they bounced back really nicely, a little more stable through the other 2 regions. But yes, I think that's been pretty consistent. We have to see how this whole weather thing in Houston plays out. But for the time being, it's pretty good. We didn't see a lot of unusual behavior in the market, no. Tough for us to see that from others perspective, but it's a strong I would think generally a strong and a stable market. So I don't know how people made bets with regard to where stuff was moving. Ketan, yes, I would tell you that we're closer to the end in terms of how we expect margins to normalize. We're still below normal in terms of volume. So that's a pressure-filled environment. It's always very competitive. It always has been. We expect it always will be on the commodity side. But that now needs to be a battle cry that we rise to, right? And it's something that we've done for years and we feel good about. \n There's a -- there's an expectation that the little player will always be more competitive, and we think that will continue to play out. But by and large, I think margins have performed well. There's certainly been some aggressiveness from certain vendors, but in most cases, it's in response to past moves. So more of a normalization, more of a rebound back -- a mean reversion, if you will, rather than a, oh, we're in trouble, we need to do something dramatic. Does that make sense?"

            "name": "David Rush",
            "content": "Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Our resilient first quarter results reflect our differentiated product portfolio and scale, our team members consistent focus on executing our strategic priorities and our operational efficiency initiatives. As we expected, a weakening multifamily market and higher mortgage rates, driving affordability challenges were headwinds to start the year. Despite these micro challenges, we built on our successes and drove growth through our value-added products portfolio in our industry-leading digital platform. . \n We are committed to advancing innovation and delivering exceptional customer service as a trusted and preferred partner to our customers. We are focused on executing our clear strategic pillars, as shown on Slide 3. Our investments in value-added products, install services and digital solutions are driving organic growth, delivering greater efficiency and empowering the next generation of homebuilding. For those who are new to the BFS story, value-added products include manufactured components such as trusses, Ready-Frame and wall panels as well as windows, doors and millwork.  \n Through our value-added products and install services we help meet our customer needs, such as reducing cycle times, addressing labor constraints and improving home construction quality. With our digital tools, we are providing our customers with a more efficient and cost-effective way to manage the construction of their homes that will increase existing customer stickiness, win new business and improve our operational efficiency. We remain committed to innovation and continuously seeking to do things better.  \n We have a robust set of operational and productivity initiatives and are focused on leveraging our scale and fixed cost while delivering the highest quality products and services to our customers. We are deploying capital in a disciplined manner with a proven M&A strategy and a track record of buying back shares at competitive prices. Working alongside the best team in the industry, I am confident that we will continue to compound long-term shareholder value and achieve our strategic priorities.  \n Let's turn to our first quarter highlights on Slide 4. We continued to deliver strong margins in Q1, reflecting our end-segment diversification, focused execution and differentiated product portfolio and scale. Our gross margins of more than 33% reflect a higher mix of value-added products, including multifamily truss and our ability to manufacture more efficiently. We expect the multifamily end segment to progressively normalize over the course of this year, and we continue to see some normalization in core margins.  \n Moving to Slide 5.  We're off to a strong start on our strategic initiatives. Our full digital product launch at the International Builders' Show in February was an exciting milestone. At a high level, our digital tools do 3 things: one, solve customer pain points; two, make it even easier to partner with us and our suppliers; and three, help us gain incremental business from new and existing customers. It's a win-win, and we're excited about how everything is going so far after the launch.  \n We're focused on operational excellence and innovation and using playbooks of proven best practices to increase our safety, efficiency and wallet share with customers. One area where we're using playbooks is with our installed services business. Our install sales increased by 17% year-over-year as we leverage our capabilities to help customers address labor constraints. Additionally, we drove $40 million in productivity savings in Q1, primarily through procurement and SG&A initiatives. We believe prudent expense management leads to maximum operational flexibility. This includes optimizing our footprint and balancing cost reductions against future capacity demands.  \n We will remain disciplined managers of this discretionary spending no matter the operating environment. Early momentum in single-family has slowed as persistent inflation has cooled short-term expectations for interest rate reductions. However, low existing home inventories and pent-up demand provide an environment where growth has continued to build. Builders across the board are having to navigate affordability issues and challenges with the regulatory environment, land development and infrastructure.  \n It's evident that the large national builders have done a good job of utilizing specs, reducing home sizes and providing interest rate buydowns to assist buyers with affordable options. Smaller builders are more likely to benefit from rate cuts. We are staying in close contact with our customers of all sizes to maximize our business in the current environment. As we have detailed on prior calls, multifamily became a headwind in Q1 as our activity levels and record backlogs have declined versus the prior year.  \n It is important to note, however, that multifamily remains a strong contributor to gross margins and EBITDA even at current levels.  \n Turning to M&A on Slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In the first quarter, we completed 2 deals with aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $36 million. In early February, we acquired Quality Door and Millwork, a leading distributor of millwork, doors and windows in Southern Idaho.  \n In March, we acquired Hanson Truss, which further strengthens our value-added position in Northern California and Nevada. And last week, we acquired [ Schoeneman's Building Materials ]. [ Schoeneman's ] manufactures trusses and distributes building materials in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota area. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. M&A and organic investments have increased value-added products as a percent of our overall mix by 700 basis points over the past 2 years and by 1,000 basis points if you go back to 2019.  \n Our success with this strategy has been a core component of our improved margin profile through the cycle. We believe there is a long runway of M&A targets in our fragmented market, and we are pleased with recent improvements in the pipeline. Our disciplined approach to M&A includes increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions and enhancing customer retention.  \n On Slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter, we completed a $1 billion note offering which brought us additional financial flexibility to grow organically and remain acquisitive while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In addition to the 2 tuck-in acquisitions, we repurchased $20 million of shares as proven by our track record, we'll continue to buy back shares while allocating capital to high-return opportunities. We remain on track to strategically deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026 as outlined at Investor Day last December.  \n Now let's turn to Slides 8 and 9 for an update on our digital strategy. As the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space, we believe BFS digital tools will be transformative for the industry and a substantial driver of organic growth. Our easy-to-use portal myBLDR.com seamlessly delivers our full digital capabilities to our customers. It is designed to create efficiencies for our team members and improved service for our customers by offering increased transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. Combined with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, our customers will have more control over the entire building process. This will save time and money for both our customers and their clients while making the homebuilding process more personalized.  \n We were proud to highlight the full digital product capabilities at IBS in February. Our customers told us the new tools address an unmet need, and they were excited to use them in their businesses. Since launch in late February, we have seen orders on the digital platform go from nearly 0 to over $60 million. In Q1, we had incremental sales of over $10 million. We remain confident in our ability to meet our targets of $200 million of incremental digital revenue by the end of this year and $1 billion by 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers.  \n One of our digital tools, Build Optimize uses advanced 3D modeling to identify construction clashes and resolve mechanical design conflicts before breaking ground. It ensures architects, builders and trades are coordinated and building to the same plan. As a proof point of the advantages of using this transformative tool, we've seen interest from 4 large builders. One of these customers has used it in 3 markets and 13 communities across 34 plants. On average, we have identified 150 conflicts per plant, resolving those conflicts before construction leads to job site time and cost savings.  \n One of my favorite initiatives at BFS is acknowledging team members who go above and beyond. Ira Banks in Atlanta, Georgia personifies this quality. Ira began with BFS in 1996 as a driver helper and rose through the ranks to operations manager and now oversees our new Atlanta Millwork facility in Dacula. Ira has the respect of his team members because he's willing to do whatever it takes to solve problems and add value for our customers. Recently, when there was no available drivers for an urgent customer delivery that had to arrive that day, Ira drove the box truck himself to take care of the customer.  \n I'm grateful for Ira's drive to lead by example, a quality we find consistently in leaders across BFS. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Thanks, Peter. Let me close by summarizing how we're set up to drive long-term profitable growth by executing our strategic pillars. We believe we are the unquestioned leader in addressing our customers' pain points through our focus on customer service, value-added products and install services. Our industry-leading digital innovations are bringing greater efficiency to homebuilding and will win us new customers and grow wallet share along the way.  \n Our robust free cash flow generation is funding disciplined capital deployment that will maximize returns and compound long-term shareholder value. We have a proven playbook for growth during complex operating environments, and we'll keep working to be the best and deliver excellence every day. Thank you again for joining us today. \n Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. Yes. The only thing I'd add is -- echo  the overarching demand profile continues to be strong. I think the timing of when they actually execute the buy is kind of what is a little more volatile than the expectation that they will execute the buy. And that's part of it but our builder customers are still indicating that they are seeing that demand, and they're expecting the similar trajectory that we've forecasted for ourselves for the back half. Yes. Thanks, Trey. What I would tell you is multifamily in specific, some of that backlog is getting extended. So where at one point in time in the year, I may have thought more of those jobs would finish quicker. They're spread now. It's actually a good thing. It kind of smoothed that transition for us in one way. The other thing I'd tell you about multifamily, our team has done a great job going after pseudo multifamily. \n Smaller multifamily projects, customers, they [ haven't ] typically gone after that are helping also transition that hasn't started yet, but we're seeing a lot of good momentum in that space, things like assisted living versus a 4-level apartment complex. So smaller jobs as you take them by themselves, but add it up, it will help the transition.\n But single family is kind of operating the way we expected it to. There's been --  it's never retracted below a level. It's a build, and it's a continual build, but at the end of the day, is it as steep of a build as we would like? Of course, not, it's not as robust as we would like ever, but it's steady and it's there, and it doesn't retract. That's an important factor. It is a build even as it's a slower build than we'd love to see. And we're adjusting that as we need to, to those market conditions. Yes. And I would add, a good indicator for me is always our truss backlog. Our truss backlog is at healthy levels. It's continuing to build. That's an indicator for us of what's to come. And that -- if that was starting to slack off, I might give a little more worried, but it's where it needs to be for us to be in a healthy situation. The only thing I'd add is our highest variable cost obviously is our labor. And the field and the team have done an exceptional job keeping labor as a percent of gross profit, which is our key metric, right in line with our operating -- within the parameters of what we set for ourselves in this level of sales and activity and our tools for managing that cost are as good as they've ever been in my 25 years with the company. So the key factor for us in managing SG&A is how well we manage our labor down at the field level, and they've done exceptional at that since the beginning of the year. Well, good morning, Keith, if you recall, Keith, this time last year or in the first quarter last year, we were just coming out of normalization of the supply chain, windows and doors were getting delivered timely again, and the national builders focus on completions in that first quarter was at a higher level just to catch up. That kind of was the [ PIG in the pipeline ] for us last year in higher millwork and [ window and ] the door sales in the first quarter than normal. I would tell you this first quarter was normal. So we had to roll over those numbers from last year where it was a bit more tilted towards completions where this year was more normal with respect to completions. \n There has been some deflation in the category, and specifically, I think, with millwork -- on the millwork side. And that's affected it modestly. I think we saw pretty close. Our volumes did exactly what we expected our volumes to do and it was more along the lines of some of the deflationary impact along with rolling over that higher degree of completions last first quarter, that really explained the difference. So you're talking about customer pricing or vendor pricing. So it's -- as you would expect and why we play in those categories, that is less price sensitive on the manufacturing side because once you get locked in with the designer and you get locked in with somebody who's going to meet delivery schedules and whatnot. That becomes more important factor. Now as commodities have fluctuated and the fact that they are a component of manufacturing that affects the price as commodities go up or down, and they've been going down for lumber slightly. \n But you know what we've been able to do is offset some of that with our efficiencies that we've been able to gain throughout since the merger with our automation investments and our continual improvement in actual board foot per labor hour produced has been a nice offset to some of those challenges. But as a whole, value add continues to hold in there better than commodities, which, of course, is in line with our strategy. Yes. I would say all of the above. We had a strong install business. We did $2.5 billion in labor and materials installed in 2023. So we had a nice base to work from. And our initial focus, as you would expect, was on the products that we are already good at in one market and leveraging that platform to other markets. And it's the products that we're most familiar with and the products that we distribute every day. So we've got off to a great start. A lot of that increase is from existing markets that are already doing install because those are the ones that had the base to work from. \n But we developed really nice playbooks, and we've had really good interest, which has been pull interest. So as people reaching out, I want to get into this business, how do I do it the right way versus us saying, \"Hey, you need to get into this business.\" Which is in my role, in my seat, that's what you want to see. And we've got really good people, really good plans, and we just think it's the next evolution for us as a company in solving our customer pain points and doing it methodically and in a way that we don't make mistakes. That's key for me, to do it the right way and make sure that what we are generating is customer value added solutions. It's a little, it depends on the product category first of all. But the national builders certainly like the install solution wherever they can apply it. \n The custom guys like it, but they're a little more specific to millwork or a little more specific to install windows probably not so much installed framing, right? So it's a really good play for the national builders. They seem to like that the best, but there are applications for both segments. Yes. And install is a natural evolution to the value add. It's the next part of value add, not only do you get the components delivered to the job site, but you actually install the components that are delivered to the job site, that's just a natural evolution of doing more for our customers. What I would tell you, Tyler, is not any more than usual. Again, where we differentiate ourselves is in the value-added solution in the value-added space, and that's for a reason. Anybody can do commodities, anybody can deliver lumber. It's hard to differentiate yourself in a straight distribution model. So we do see competition in that arena for sure. We try to leverage our relationships with those customers where we do other stuff for them very well and use that as a way to continue to maintain share on the commodity side versus just getting into a price war. \n So we do see competition in that regard. We choose to compete where we want to compete in that regard. But we'll always do a high percentage of lumber. We're good at doing lumber. We're good at meeting schedules and making sure the lumber is there when the customer wants it. And we get recognized for that and where we get that recognition is where we play. But in short, a lot more competition on the commodity side than the noncommodity side and our reputation on the value-added space carries us a long way. What I would tell you juices me the most was the traffic we had at our booth at IBS. I have never in my 25 years of going to IBS seen the kind of excitement and the kind of traffic that went through our booth, primarily because of our digital platform and showing what capabilities that it was going to present. The other  thing I would say is, think about it, if you're a smaller builder, 50 to 200 homes a year, you don't have the ability to invest in technology for yourself to get this to the level of platform that we're developing. \n What we're doing is leveraging our ability to make those investments develop that platform for our customers of that size so that they can play in that space and be efficient without having to make a huge upfront investment themselves. So that's the rationale behind why we developed it and why we think it will be appealing to our customer base and if IBS is any indication, we hit it right on the head."
